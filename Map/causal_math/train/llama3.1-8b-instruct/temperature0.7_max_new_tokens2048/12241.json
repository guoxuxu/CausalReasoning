  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the electric potential \\\\( V \\\\) in a region is governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 V = 0 \\\\). An external operator manipulates the boundary conditions or introduces additional charge densities \\\\( \\\\rho \\\\), which changes the solutions of the equation.\n\nGiven the distribution of \\\\( V \\\\) at a later time, can one unequivocally determine whether a change in \\\\( \\\\rho(y) \\\\) or boundary conditions was responsible for a specific distribution pattern, without prior knowledge of interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Both modifications in charge density \\\\( \\\\rho(y) \\\\) and changes in boundary conditions could yield similar potential distributions under Laplace's equation. Without explicit knowledge of the history or characteristics of interventions, it isn't possible to attribute the effect to one specific cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
