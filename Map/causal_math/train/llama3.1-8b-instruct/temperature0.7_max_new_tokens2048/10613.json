  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We explore the effect of an integral transformation given by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and T is a finite upper limit.\n\nIf the function \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the resulting transformation is used to compute \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\), will it yield the same result as directly computing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) changes the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by incorporating the exponential decay factor \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\) in the integration process, thereby generating an entirely different function from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at the upper limit T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
