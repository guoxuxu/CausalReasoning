  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in control theory, described by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{N(s)}{D(s)} \\\\), where \\\\( N(s) \\\\) and \\\\( D(s) \\\\) are polynomial functions of the complex variable s. We investigate the behavior of the system's output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) when the input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is subjected to the Fourier Transform of a step function, i.e., \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) is directly applied to the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( H(s) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, where the superposition and convolution principles hold, the output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) for a given input \\\\( X(s) \\\\) through the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) will indeed be \\\\( H(s) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) under ideal conditions without additional modifications or interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
