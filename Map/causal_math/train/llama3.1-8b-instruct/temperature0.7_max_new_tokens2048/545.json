  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), which is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. The effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, where Q is also a complex constant, is analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) immediately changes the initial state to \\\\( z_0' = e^{Q0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) but at any time t, the system is effectively re-scaled and rotated in the complex plane, thereby altering the trajectory from that of the original system under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\). The evolution path of z will now be different, influenced by both P and Q.",
