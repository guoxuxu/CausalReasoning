  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function's behavior when subjected to Laplace Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and its transformation into the Laplace domain, defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the implications of altering the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and its effects on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additive intervention in the form of a damping factor, represented by \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha > 0 \\\\), is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain only be affected by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and not by any changes to \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a damping factor changes \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), leading to \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{(i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha)t}\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha - i\\\\omega} \\\\). Both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) affect the resultant Laplace transform, affecting the pole location through a combined translation in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
