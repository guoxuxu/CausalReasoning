  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We will examine how changes in the time domain function affect its Laplace transform and vice versa, taking into account voluntary interventions in the form of derivative operations.\n\nIf we apply the derivative operator \\\\( D^n \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in the time domain where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, and then compute the Laplace transform, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be the same as the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without applying \\\\( D^n \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the derivative operator \\\\( D^n \\\\) changes the function in the time domain, which modifies its Laplace transform. By the properties of the Laplace transform, each derivative in the time domain adds a factor related to powers of \\\\( s \\\\), making the transformed function depend on the derivatives of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
