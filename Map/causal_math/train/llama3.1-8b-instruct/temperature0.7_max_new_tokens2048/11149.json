  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. We explore the effect of a transformation, defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the magnitude and possibly the phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), depending on the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). This initial transformation modifies the trajectory of z under the differential equation, leading to a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
