  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the complex function is \\\\( z(t) = w(t) + iu(t) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) \\\\) representing the real part and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) the imaginary part governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{w} = Cw\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Du\\\\), here C and D are constant matrices. Analyze the system after applying the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(w(t)) + i\\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) and then conducting an inverse transform.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation described by another integral transform (say, Fourier transform) is applied as an intervention, will this affect the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1, considering only transformations derived from C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new transformation, such as the Fourier transform, can significantly alter the dynamics of the system because it may change the representation and interaction of the function's components (real and imaginary parts), which are governed by different matrices (C and D). These effects would indeed affect the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
