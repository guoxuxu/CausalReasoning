  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The Laplace Transform of this function is used to analyze its behavior in the complex frequency domain, represented as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an external modification alters \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at a specific time to \\\\( v'(t) = v(t) * e^{-bt} \\\\) (where b is a constant), and the system is observed at a later time, does the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) depend only on the original functions and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by modifying \\\\( v(t) \\\\) to \\\\( v'(t) = v(t) * e^{-bt} \\\\) significantly changes the Laplace Transform of \\\\( v(t) \\\\), shifting it by a factor of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s+b} \\\\), and thereby the overall transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is affected.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
