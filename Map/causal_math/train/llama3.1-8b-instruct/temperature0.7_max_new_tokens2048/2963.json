  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where the temperature distribution over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the influence of a spatial transformation given by \\\\(g(x) = ax+b\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants, on this temperature distribution.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(x) = ax+b\\\\) is altered to \\\\(h(x) = cx+d\\\\) at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\) are new constants, and the system evolves till time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), does the final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) depend solely on the original heat equation parameters and not on \\\\(a, b, c\\\\), or \\\\(d\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new spatial transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) modifies the spatial description again, affecting the way heat diffuses through the rod. The end temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) therefore depends on both the original parameters \\\\(k\\\\) and the constants \\\\(a, b, c\\\\), and \\\\(d\\\\) due to the changes in spatial coordinates at times \\\\(0\\\\) and \\\\(t_1\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
