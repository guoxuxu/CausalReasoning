  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we analyze the flow of a fluid in a channel influenced by a vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{v} = k(x,y,z) \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a scalar function of position and \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) is the original velocity field. The fluid properties are altered by a transformation, described by \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} + \\\\nabla h \\\\), where \\\\( h(x,y,z,t) \\\\) is a scalar field function of space and time.\n\nGiven the state of the fluid flow at time T, can we accurately deduce the original unmodified vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) \\\\), reconstructing the original vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) from the fluid flow at time T is problematic. The presence or absence of the transformation \\\\( \\\\nabla h \\\\) significantly influences the initial state and thus cannot be ignored.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
