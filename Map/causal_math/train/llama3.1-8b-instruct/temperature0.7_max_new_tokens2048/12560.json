  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a complex potential field given by \\\\( V(z) = z^2 + iz \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number describing the position of the particle on the complex plane. We investigate the trajectories using the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + e^{it} \\\\), where t represents time.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to the complex position \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the movement is analyzed under the potential \\\\( V(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the trajectory of the particle be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly used to analyze movement under \\\\( V(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition, which affects the evolution of the trajectory under the complex potential \\\\( V(z) \\\\). The addition of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) introduces a rotating complex term that alters how the particle moves through the potential landscape.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
