  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\), where L is inductance, R is resistance and E(t) represents a time-dependent electromotive force. Further, suppose that an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by multiplying the current amplitude by a scalar \\\\( k \\\\) is applied, and we explore how this affects the response of the system over time t.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( I(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to determine with certainty which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) throughout the timeline?",
  "Explanation": "Given the end current at \\\\( T \\\\), it is challenging to discern definitively which specific interventions were applied since both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\) modify the current by scaling factors that could be compounded or influenced by the dynamics governed by L, R, and E(t). The outcomes implying the application of either or both functions are not uniquely distinguishable solely based on the endpoint state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
