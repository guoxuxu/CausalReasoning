  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a physical system, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform on this function.\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), the transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), with no additional data, can we reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t?",
  "Explanation": "If \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is known and is a proper Laplace transform of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), then the inverse Laplace transform can be used systematically to retrieve \\\\( z(t) \\\\) accurately, assuming all the necessary conditions for convergence are satisfied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
