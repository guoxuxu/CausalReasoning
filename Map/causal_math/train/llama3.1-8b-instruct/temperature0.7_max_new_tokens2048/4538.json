  "Problem": "A complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined where \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied, and the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is studied under this transformation over time.\n\nGiven the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) was applied at t = 0, without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the intent or initial application of the transformation, the resulting observation \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could equivalently be from an untransformed state that started from a different initial condition (e.g., \\\\( z_0 = e^{i\\\\pi} \\\\)). The reduced form of the trajectory alone does not reveal whether the transformation was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
