  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit containing an RLC (Resistor, Inductor, Capacitor) series circuit driven by a sinusoidal voltage source V(t) = V0 * sin(ωt). The relationship between the input voltage and current is governed by the differential equation L*d^2I/dt^2 + R*dI/dt + (1/C)*I = dV/dt, where I is the current, L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nIf at time t1, an additional resistive component R1 is introduced in parallel to the existing RLC circuit and the driving frequency ω is increased, will the new steady state solution for current I(t) at time t > t1 be significantly different?'",
  "Explanation": "Adding a parallel resistor R1 modifies the overall resistance of the circuit, altering the damping factor (R total). Increasing the driving frequency ω also impacts the impedance due to the inductive and capacitive components, affecting amplitude and phase of the current. Together, these factors converge to significantly alter the system's dynamic and steady state response compared to the original configuration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "R → I; L → I; C → I; dV/dt → I; d^2I/dt^2 → I; dI/dt → I; ω → I; R1 → I; R → R1; L → R1; C → R1",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The introduction of an additional resistive component R1 in parallel to the existing RLC circuit and the increase in driving frequency ω will significantly affect the steady state solution for current I(t) because R1 directly influences the current I, and the driving frequency ω indirectly influences the current I through its effect on the differential equation governing the circuit."
