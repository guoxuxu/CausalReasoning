  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with an inductor, capacitor, and resistor (LCR circuit) where its behavior is described by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = 0\\\\). An external voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{st}\\\\) is considered as a function transformation applying to the system.\n\nIf the external voltage source \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is applied at t = 0 and the system evolves without further intervention, will the current \\\\(i(t)\\\\) at t = T follow the same solution path as the homogeneous solution to the differential equation without the voltage source?",
  "Explanation": "The external voltage source changes the system's driving function, leading to a particular solution that adds to the homogeneous solution, thereby altering the total response of the system at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "External voltage source V(t) → system evolution; System evolution → current i(t); External voltage source V(t) → system behavior; System behavior → current i(t); Capacitor C → inductor L; Resistor R → inductor L; Resistor R → capacitor C; Inductor L → current i(t); Capacitor C → current i(t); Resistor R → current i(t); System behavior → homogeneous solution; System behavior → current i(t); System evolution → homogeneous solution"
