  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is the initial condition vector. We explore the impact of the operator \\\\( h(z) = Re^{Ft}z \\\\), where R is a complex matrix function and F a constant matrix, applied over time t.\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( j(z) = Se^{Gt}z \\\\), where S is another constant matrix and G a constant matrix, is applied at a later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely rely on D and not on F or G?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further modifies the system's state, adding a dependence not only on D but also on F and G. These cumulative transformations (initial change by R and later by S) shape the final state at t = T and make it contingent on how F, G interact with D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
