  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. We investigate the effect of the inverse transformation given by multiplying the transform by \\\\( s^2 \\\\) and then applying the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nCan the specific transformations applied (shift and multiply in s-domain) be deduced just by analyzing the transformed time-domain function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without other data?",
  "Explanation": "Although the final form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) retains characteristics influenced by the transformations (shift by \\\\( b \\\\) and multiplication by \\\\( s^2 \\\\)), deciphering the exact nature or sequence of transformations applied solely from \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is ambiguous without additional information or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
