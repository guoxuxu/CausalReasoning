  "Problem": "Consider the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. The effect of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed over time interval [0, T].\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is integrated from t = 0 to T without any modification, does this integral transformation change the periodicity or fundamental nature of the function?",
  "Explanation": "The integral \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{iAt} dt \\\\) results in a complex sinusoidal wave where the periodic nature of \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) is enclosed within the integral. This transformation results in a function that has magnitude but does not itself oscillate or retain the periodicity of the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
