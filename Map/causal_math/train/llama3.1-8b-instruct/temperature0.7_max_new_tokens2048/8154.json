  "Problem": "Let us consider a scenario where the current in a circuit is modified through a signal processing function, described by \\\\( I'(t) = L(I(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator characterizing an integral transformation. Here, \\\\( I(t) \\\\) represents the original current signal over time, and we analyze the effects of this transformation over the performance of the circuit.\n\nGiven the output signal \\\\( I'(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to recover the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) precisely, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) has been applied and modifies the signal in a nontrivial way (such as changing its frequency spectrum), it could be impossible to trace back to \\\\( I_0 \\\\) accurately without specific knowledge of the transformation characteristics. Essential attributes of the original signal might be lost or obscured.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
