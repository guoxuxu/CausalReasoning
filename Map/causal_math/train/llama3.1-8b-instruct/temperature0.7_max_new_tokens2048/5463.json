  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\), where K is a constant matrix. Investigate the system's behavior under the transformation \\( g(x) = Q^{-1}x \\) over time t, where Q is a constant and invertible matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( h(x) = Qx \\) is applied as an intervention, does the endpoint \\( x(T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on K and not on Q?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( h(x) \\) introduces another level of transformation, making the final state \\( x(T) \\) dependent on the effects of both the initial transformation \\( Q^{-1} \\) and the intervention \\( Q \\), in addition to the system matrix K. The behavior is shaped by how these transformations interact with K.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
