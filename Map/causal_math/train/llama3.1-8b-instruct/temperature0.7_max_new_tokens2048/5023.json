  "Problem": "Consider an electrical system governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{V} = LV\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear operator describing the system's inductance matrix. Analyze the effects of applying a linear transformation \\(\\phi(V) = e^{Mt}V\\), where \\(M\\) is another inductance matrix, on the voltage \\(V\\) over time \\(t\\).\n\nAssuming a new transformation \\(\\psi(V) = e^{Nt}V\\) (where \\(N\\) is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\(t_1\\), will the endpoint \\(V(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) be influenced only by the original matrix \\(L\\) and not by \\(M\\) or \\(N\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\(\\psi(V) = e^{Nt}V\\) introduces a new dynamic, affecting the endpoint \\(V(T)\\) and making it dependent on \\(M\\), \\(N\\), as well as \\(L\\). The transformations \\(e^{Mt}\\) and \\(e^{Nt}\\) can significantly influence the system's trajectory and the final state \\(V(T)\\) through their cumulative effects over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
