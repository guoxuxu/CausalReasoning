  "Problem": "Analyze the stability and behavior of a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation in the form \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\vec{u}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)\\\\vec{u} = -\\\\nabla p + \\\\nu \\\\nabla^2 \\\\vec{u}\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\vec{u}\\\\) is the fluid velocity, \\\\(p\\\\) is the pressure, and \\\\(\\\\nu\\\\) is the viscosity. Consider the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\vec{u}(t))\\\\) applied to the velocity field.\n\nIf the initial velocity field \\\\(\\\\vec{u}_0\\\\) is transformed by Laplace transform and evolved according to the Navier-Stokes equation, will the velocity field \\\\(\\\\vec{u}(t)\\\\) at any time t be described accurately by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform linearizes the problem allowing the governing equations to be treated in the transformed domain. If correctly transformed and no other transformations are applied, the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s)\\\\) should recover the original velocity field \\\\(\\\\vec{u}(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
