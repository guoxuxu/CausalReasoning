  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real scalar. The system's evolution is assessed with and without the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real scalar.\n\nCan we determine the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, it's unclear if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) has been altered by the phase shift \\\\( e^{iBT} \\\\). The transformation can significantly change the initial state, and without this knowledge, one cannot uniquely trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) especially if \\\\( B \\\\) significantly alters the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
