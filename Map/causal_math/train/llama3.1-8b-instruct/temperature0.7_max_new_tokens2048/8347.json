  "Problem": "Consider a scalar linear time-invariant (LTI) system represented by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = kx\\\\), where k is a real constant. The Laplace transform of x(t) is used to obtain the transfer function, and various filters represented by transfer functions \\\\(H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+p}\\\\) are applied, where p is a pole introduced by the filter.\n\nIf at t = t_1, an additional filter with a different pole q is applied, will the output \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be solely determined by the original system dynamics (constant k) and not by any filter properties (poles p or q)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of another filter introduces a new dynamic element into the system. The output \\\\(x(T)\\\\) will depend on the interaction of both filters with the LTI system, reflecting the effects of both poles p and q along with the system's inherent dynamics represented by k. This compound effect alters the trajectory from what would be produced by just the underlying system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
