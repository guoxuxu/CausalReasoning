  "Problem": "Consider a magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B} = B_0 e^{-kt} \\\\hat{z} \\\\), acting on a charged particle resulting in the Lorentz force equation \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\vec{v}} = q (\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}) \\\\). We explore the effects of an applied electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} = E_0 \\\\hat{x} \\\\) as a transformation on the particle's motion.\n\nIf a new magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B}_1 = B_1 e^{-kt} \\\\hat{y} \\\\) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint trajectory of the particle for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B} \\\\) and not on the electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\) or the new magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B}_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a new magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B}_1 \\\\) introduces additional rotational influences, shifting the net Lorentz force direction, and thereby affecting the trajectory. Both the initial and intervening fields' configurations importantly shape the resultant particle path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
