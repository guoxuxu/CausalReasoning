  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + pu_x = 0 \\\\), with p being a constant. We explore the consequences of applying the Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ikx}u(x,t) dx \\\\), to the function u(x, t).\n\nKnowing the final transformed state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we unambiguously determine whether the Laplace transform, Fourier transform, or both were applied over the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "The final form \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) may result from various maneuvers including different combinations or sequences of transformations, given the potential complexity and superposition principles in linear systems. The overlap and interaction between transformations complicate definitive back-tracing of which specific transformations were employed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
