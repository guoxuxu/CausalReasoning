  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where t represents time. Consider further the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), defined for complex s where Re(s) > 0.\n\nIf we apply a damping factor e^{-\\alpha t} (where \\\\( \\\\alpha > 0 \\\\)) as an intervention on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), does this modification lead to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) having a pole only at s = -(i + \\\\alpha)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the damping factor transforms \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into \\\\( z(t) e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), shifting the pole of the resulting Laplace transform to s = i + \\\\alpha from s = i. However, there will still be essential singularities and behavior captured elsewhere in the complex plane depending on the values of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and other properties of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
