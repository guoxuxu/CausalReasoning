  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. Analyze the changes induced by performing a Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function, leading to the transformed function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and allowed to remain unaffected further, will the result \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) retain information about the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\) results in a Dirac delta function at \\\\( \\omega' = \\omega \\\\), thus preserving information about the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). It directly links the cause (original function) to the effect (Fourier transform), clearly reflecting the original system’s characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
