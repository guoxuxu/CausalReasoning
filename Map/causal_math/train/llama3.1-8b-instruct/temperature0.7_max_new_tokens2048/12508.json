  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + At + B \\\\), where A and B are constants. Analysis is done on the effect of the linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Uz \\\\), where U is a constant matrix, that modifies the trajectory of z.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\), then let evolve under the original function without further transformations, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be purely quadratic at t=T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) transforms the initial conditions by multiplying it by the matrix U. This modifies not just the initial value but potentially the entire trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making it include linear components influenced by U even at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
