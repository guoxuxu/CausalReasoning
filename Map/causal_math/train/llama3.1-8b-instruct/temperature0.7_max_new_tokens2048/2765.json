  "Problem": "Assess a dynamic system governed by partial differential equation \\\\(u_{xx} + u_{yy} + \\lambda u = 0\\\\) defined over a domain \\\\(D\\\\) with boundary conditions. Consider an integral transform \\\\(T(u) = \\int_D e^{-\\lambda xy} u(x, y) \\, dx \\, dy\\\\) and its impact on the solution \\\\(u\\\\).\n\nIf the initial function \\\\(u_0\\\\) is transformed by \\\\(T\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then evolves according to the differential equation without further modifications, will \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be identical to its evolution from \\\\(u_0\\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(u)\\\\) alters the effective initial condition by integrating over the domain with a weighting function \\\\(e^{-\\lambda xy}\\\\). This modification changes how \\\\(u(x,y,t)\\\\) evolves over time, thereby altering the state at any subsequent time \\\\(t = T\\\\) from what it would have been without applying \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
