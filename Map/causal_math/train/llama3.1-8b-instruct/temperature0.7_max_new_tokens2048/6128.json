  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) describes the time evolution of a complex vector \\\\( w \\\\) under a complex transformation, where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. The effect of an integral transformation characterized by the operator \\\\( T(t) \\\\) which modifies the vector by \\\\( T(t)w = w + itAw \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nCan we unambiguously determine the times and nature (whether \\\\( T(t) \\\\) or \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\)) of interventions used during the system's evolution to \\\\( z(T) \\\\), based solely on the knowledge of the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping influences of \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) and any uses of \\\\( T(t) \\\\) complicate retroactively discerning specific interventions. Multiple configurations and timings of applying \\\\( T(t) \\\\) and the evolution under \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) can lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions and their times.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
