  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing angular frequency. We explore the effects on the function after applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = z e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied at the start?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), we cannot accurately backtrack to determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the complex exponential factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha T} \\\\), which might modify both the magnitude and phase of the initial value in an irreversible way.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
