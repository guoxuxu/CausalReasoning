  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = My\\\\), and M is a constant matrix. We study the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Dt}y \\\\) applied at different instances, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nDoes the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without any intervention remain unaffected when initially transformed by \\\\( h(y) \\\\) compared to when it is not transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(y) = e^{Dt}y \\\\) modifies the initial state of \\\\( y \\\\), and given that \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}y(t) \\\\), the outcome \\\\( y(T) \\\\) and consequently \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be altered. The alteration depends on how D interacts with M, influencing the evolution distinctly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
