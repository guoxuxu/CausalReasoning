  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effects and reversibility of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after both initial Laplace transformation and later inverse Laplace transformation at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine the exact sequence of transformations applied, only based on the state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intermediate states could have resulted in the same final state at T due to differing effects of A and B and the non-trivial interaction with Laplace and inverse Laplace transformations. Without additional information on the sequence or specifics of transformations, determining the exact applied operations solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
