  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\) is mapped using \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. We investigate the function under two scenarios: one driven by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Bz \\\\) with B being another complex constant, and another by a transformation function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a third complex constant.\n\nFor an initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t=0 \\\\), if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied initially and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Bz \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > 0 be the same as directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Bz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) modifies the initial conditions, and thus, due to the transformation, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ unless A and B commute in a particular way that aligns the transformations' effects over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
