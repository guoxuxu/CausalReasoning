  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We analyze the behavior of the transformed function under a translation operation in the time domain, i.e., \\\\( g(t) = f(t-a) \\\\) with a positive a, represented by \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as}F(s) \\\\).\n\nConsidering the transformed function \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as}F(s) \\\\), can we infer exactly the amount of time shift \\\\( a \\\\) that was applied to the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact value of \\\\( a \\\\) purely from the transformed function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is not possible without additional information about \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Multiple time shifts could produce the same effects in the transform domain, especially if initial conditions or function specifics are unknown.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
