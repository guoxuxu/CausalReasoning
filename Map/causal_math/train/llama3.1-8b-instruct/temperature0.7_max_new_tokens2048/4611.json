  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) applied to a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We analyze the behavior of the system under the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(x) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is another matrix.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) (where B is another matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be unaffected by the initial matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(x) = e^{Bt}x \\\\) does not nullify the effects of the initial transformation \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\). The system’s trajectory is now influenced by both A and B applied at different times, leading to a final state that depends on the interaction and possibly non-commutative properties of A and B in addition to D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
