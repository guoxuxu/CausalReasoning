  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( y(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-s^2} u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) represents an input function. We study the role of transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) on input function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and observe its impact over the interval [0, a].\n\nFrom the outcome \\\\( y(a) \\\\), can we specify which interventions (whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) occurred, solely based on the endpoint value?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple transformations \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) could produce the same or similar values of \\\\( y(a) \\\\) due to the overlap in potential resulting integrals. The non-linear transformations and their effects complicate unequivocal identification of the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
