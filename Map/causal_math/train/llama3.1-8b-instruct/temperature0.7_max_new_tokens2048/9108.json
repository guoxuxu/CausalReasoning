  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nBased on the knowledge of the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (\\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( S \\\\), or both) and their parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both the transformations and their parameters, making it impossible to uniquely back-calculate to determine the exact transformations or their parameters due to their compositional and potentially overlapping effects on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
