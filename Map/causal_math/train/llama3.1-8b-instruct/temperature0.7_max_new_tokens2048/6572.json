  "Problem": "In a complex function framework, consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a non-zero complex constant, and the implications of further transformations.\n\nCan we identify precisely which transformations (either \\\\( z \\mapsto Az \\\\), \\\\( z \\mapsto Bz \\\\), or both) were applied based only on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that transformations \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) both affect the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\), several combinations of these transformations could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without additional information, it is not possible to determine uniquely which transformations were applied to every instance by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
