  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that is defined as \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing a physical process, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We apply the Laplace transform to this function, defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), to analyze its behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the modified Laplace transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) at a later time T, can we determine precisely what intervention (the nature of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)) was used, just by observing the final state \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different transfer functions \\\\( H(s) \\\\) can produce similar modifications on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), leading to indistinct final states \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\). Without additional information or constraints about the nature of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), this ambiguity makes it impossible to uniquely identify the intervention based solely on \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
