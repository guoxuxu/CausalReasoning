  "Problem": "Assume a system where the Laplacian operator \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) governing heat distribution in a two-dimensional plane. Consider further if the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int u(x,y) e^{-x^2-y^2} dx dy \\\\) is applied to evaluate system behavior over time.\n\nCan the specific details of any interventions (like the application of \\\\( G \\\\)) be deduced solely from the value of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at time T integrates and hence obscures detailed spatial information about how the function \\\\( u \\\\) was modified by the intervention, especially given the smoothing effects of the heat equation. Multiple different interventions in terms of different kernels could yield the same cumulative effect when measured by \\\\( T \\\\), making precise identification of interventions based solely on \\\\( T(u) \\\\) infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
