  "Problem": "Examine the causal impacts within a system described by a linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a constant matrix. The study involves the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u)(s, x) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}u(t, x) dt \\\\) on the function over time.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(0, x) \\\\) is provided and the system evolves under the given PDE, will the solution at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be influenced by any aspect of the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the solution \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) under the PDE is solely determined by the initial conditions and the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), independent of the Laplace transformation applied afterward. The transformation describes a mapping in the complex plane but does not influence the real-time system's progression.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
