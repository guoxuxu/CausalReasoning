  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the output signal \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the relation \\\\( z(t) = L\\{y(t)\\} \\\\), using a Laplace transform L to convert the time-domain function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) to the frequency domain. Assume \\\\( y(t) \\\\) itself satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\dot{y} = Cy + D \\) where C and D are constant matrices.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the frequency domain, can we conclusively determine the initial time-domain signal \\\\( y(0) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( y(0) \\\\) solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The transformation \\\\( te^{Dt} \\\\) could significantly alter the initial and intermediary states of \\\\( y(t) \\\\), which directly affects the Laplace transform output.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of h influences y, and y influences z, which is then transformed by L to z(T), but the direct influence of h on z(T) is not known without considering its effect on y."
