  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function z(t) defined as z(t) = e^{At}w, where A is a complex constant matrix, and w is a complex vector. The function represents the evolution of z over time under the influence of matrix A, and we are interested in how various transformations, represented by another complex matrix B, affect this evolution.\n\nWith the knowledge of z(T) at time T, can we exactly identify which transformations (f(z) = Bz, g(z) = Cz, or both) were applied, just by looking at the value of z(T)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint z(T) could result from various sequences of transformations due to the properties of matrix multiplication and the exponential function, particularly when multiple potential transformations are involved. Without additional information about the timings or specific nature of the interventions, it is impossible to conclusively determine the pathway followed to achieve that endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
