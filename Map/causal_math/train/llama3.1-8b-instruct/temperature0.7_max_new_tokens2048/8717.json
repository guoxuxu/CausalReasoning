  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z = Ce^{At}x \\\\), where A and C are constant matrices, and x is the initial condition. We examine the effects of an input transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( x \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves based on \\\\( Ce^{At}x \\\\) without further intervention, will the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x \\\\) was used directly to compute \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the same system equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial vector x by applying D, leading to a new initial condition, \\\\( Dx \\\\). This change means that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is now \\\\( Ce^{AT}(Dx) \\\\), which generally differs from \\\\( Ce^{AT}x \\\\) unless D commutes with the exponential matrix \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), which is not generally the case.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
