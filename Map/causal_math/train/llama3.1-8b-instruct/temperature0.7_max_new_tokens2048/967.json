  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial complex amplitude and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore causal relations incorporating the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + ce^{i\\delta t} \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) being a complex constant and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) a frequency.\n\nIf an intervention involving a second transformation \\\\( h(z) = z \\cdot de^{i\\eta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( d \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( \\eta \\\\) another frequency) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system's behavior at any T > t_1 be independent of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) from the original transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of the original transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\) are superimposed, and both contribute to the final state at time T. The multiplication of exponential terms involving different frequencies leads to a complex interaction pattern between \\\\( \\omega, \\delta, \\\\) and \\\\( \\eta \\\\) which affects the system's evolution and outcome significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
