  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. The effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) over time t, with Q also being a constant matrix, is investigated.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is another constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an intervention with \\\\( k(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) adds a new variable affecting the outcome, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on matrices Q and R, as well as P. The system's path to \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by how these transformations interact and modify the overall trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
