  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(x(t), y(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex function, and both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The interaction between \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) via \\\\( u \\\\) influences the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan the exact interventions (either by \\\\( u \\\\), \\\\( v \\\\), or any combinations thereof) be uniquely determined from observing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing its functional form?",
  "Explanation": "Given the possibility of overlapping effects due to non-linear and complex interactions between \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) under the influences of \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\), the specific interventions cannot be precisely pinpointed. The multiple pathways to a similar \\\\( z(T) \\\\) introduce ambiguities in determining what exact interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
