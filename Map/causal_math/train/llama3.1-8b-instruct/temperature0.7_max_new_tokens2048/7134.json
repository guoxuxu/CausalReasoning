  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. For this scenario, let's investigate the effects of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined as an integral transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan the original constant \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be uniquely determined by knowing only the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T and without the knowledge of Fourier transform application?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\\\omega T} z_0 \\\\), and knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\), one can determine \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) since \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) can be extracted by analyzing the argument of the complex exponential change relative to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
