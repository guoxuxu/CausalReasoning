  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are square matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors. The function describes the evolution of two components combined linearly over time and affected by different transformation matrices.\n\nAssuming vectors \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are given at t = 0 without other interventions, will the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > 0 be solely influenced by the initial values \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is determined directly by the expressions \\\\( e^{AT}x \\\\) and \\\\( e^{BT}y \\\\). Since there is no alteration or intervention in the system, the effect at time T is predictably and solely dependent on the initial conditions using the given transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → x; B → y; e^(At) → e^(At)x; e^(Bt) → e^(Bt)y; x → z(T); y → z(T); e^(At)x → z(T); e^(Bt)y → z(T)"
