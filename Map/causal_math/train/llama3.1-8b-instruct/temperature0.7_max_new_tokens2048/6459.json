  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that governs temperature distribution over a rod, described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is a constant. Assume that \\\\( u(x,0) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) as the initial condition. We observe the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant, over time t.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a correction \\\\( g(u) = u - e^{bt} \\\\) (where b is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the heat diffusion coefficient k and not on a or b?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(u) \\\\) inserts another alteration into the system, directly affecting the temperature distribution and thus the solution. The resulting state at time T depends on how both exponential terms \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\) interact with the diffusion process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
