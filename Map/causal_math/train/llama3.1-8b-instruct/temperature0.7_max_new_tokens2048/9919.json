  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation on a function \\( u(x) \\) represented as \\( T[u(x)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{st} u(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number. We analyze the impact of changing the order of integration and differentiation operations under the transformation.\n\nIf \\( u(x) \\) undergoes a modification at a certain point, say applying a transformation \\( u(x) = v(x) + w(x) \\), and then \\( T \\) is applied, does the result only depend on the natural properties of \\( v(x) \\) and \\( w(x) \\) without the influence of the original \\( u(x) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result of \\( T \\) after such an intervention involves the interplay of both \\( v(x) \\) and \\( w(x) \\), not merely the sum of their individual transforms due to potential interference effects in the integral especially in non-linear scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
