  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation defined by \\\\( L(z) = Az + b \\\\), where \\( A \\) is a linear operator and \\( b \\) is a vector. We examine how the transformation and its inversion, where applicable, affect behavior over the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{cz} \\\\), with \\( c \\) being a constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and then the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied, is \\\\( L(f(z_0)) \\\\) equal to \\\\( f(L(z_0)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) after \\\\( f \\\\) results in \\\\( L(e^{cz_0}) = A(e^{cz_0}) + b \\\\), whereas applying \\\\( f \\\\) after \\\\( L \\\\) results in \\\\( f(Az_0 + b) = e^{c(Az_0 + b)} \\\\). These are generally not equivalent since the exponential function and linear transformation do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
