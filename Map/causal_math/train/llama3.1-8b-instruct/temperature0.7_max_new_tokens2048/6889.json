  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nIf we apply a Fourier transform to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allow \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) to evolve according to the PDE without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) be equivalent to evolving \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) directly to T and then applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution to the heat equation behaves as \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = e^{-Dk^2t}\\\\hat{u}(k, 0) \\\\). Therefore, whether we first solve the PDE in the time domain and then transform, or transform first and solve in the Fourier domain, the result is the same due to the linearity and time-invariance of the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
