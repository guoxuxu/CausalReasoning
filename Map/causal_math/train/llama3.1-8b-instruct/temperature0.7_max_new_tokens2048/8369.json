  "Problem": "Consider an iterative linear system transformation defined by the equation \\\\(x_{n+1} = Mx_n\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of a function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) applied periodically over discrete time steps t, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(x_{n+1} = Mx_n\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( x_n \\\\) at t = N be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = N under \\\\(x_{n+1} = Mx_n\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) changes the starting condition by transforming \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Dt}x_0 \\\\). The progression of the system under the matrix M from this new initial state will result in a different sequence and consequently, a different endpoint at t = N due to the altered dynamics caused by the initial transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
