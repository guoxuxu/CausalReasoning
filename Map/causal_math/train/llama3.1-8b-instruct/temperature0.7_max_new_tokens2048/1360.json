  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. The function describes a circle in the complex plane as a function of time t. We examine the impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) on this periodic function.\n\nKnowing the form of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\frac{1}{s + \\alpha - i\\omega} \\\\), can we definitely say that a damping intervention was applied to an originally simple harmonic function in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the term \\\\( +\\alpha \\\\) in the denominator of the Laplace transform, where \\\\( \\alpha > 0 \\\\), clearly indicates an exponential damping factor was introduced to a simple harmonic function, affecting its amplitude over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "angular frequency (ω) → complex function z(t); time (t) → complex function z(t); Laplace transformation → complex function z(t); damping intervention → change in angular frequency (ω); change in angular frequency (ω) → change in complex function z(t); change in complex function z(t) → Laplace transformation; change in angular frequency (ω) → Laplace transformation"
