  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We are looking at how integral transformations, specifically the Laplace transform, affect the function over time.\n\nFrom the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\\\), can we conclusively determine the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\\\), applying the inverse Laplace transform derives the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\). Evaluating at t = 0 gives \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\). Hence, the initial condition can be inferred directly from the transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
