  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. Suppose we apply the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\) periodically at times \\\\(t_n = nT\\\\), where \\\\(n\\\\) is an integer and \\\\(T\\\\) a constant interval.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we determine the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence or absence of the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) affecting the initial state introduces an unknown scaling factor. Without this knowledge, recovering the exact initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is ambiguous because the scaling alters the magnitude and could rotate the phase of the complex number.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
