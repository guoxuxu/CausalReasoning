  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z}\\\\) and its effect through a contour integral \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C g(w) dw \\\\), where C is a closed contour path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of modifying the path C to another path C' and the use of another complex function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) as an intervention.\n\nIf at some point during the computation a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting computation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_C h(w) dw \\\\) be independent of the initial function g?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = e^{-z} \\\\) replaces the original function \\\\( g(w) = e^w \\\\). Thus, the outcome \\\\( f(z) \\\\) becomes entirely dependent on \\\\( h(z) \\\\), irrespective of the initial function \\\\( g(w) \\\\), provided there are no additional constraints or links between g and h.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
