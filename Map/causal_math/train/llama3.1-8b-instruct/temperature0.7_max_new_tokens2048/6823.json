  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) affected by a linear time-dependent operator \\\\( L(t) = Ae^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real scalar. The evolution of the system without interventions follows the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t L(s)z(s) ds + z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial condition.\n\nIf an intervention by a second operator \\\\( M(t) = Be^{i\\\\theta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex matrix and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) a scalar) occurs at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state still depend only on the initial operator \\\\( L(t) \\\\) and not on \\\\( M(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a second operator \\\\( M(t) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward, and the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) will depend on both the impact of \\\\( L(t) \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and \\\\( M(t) \\\\) after. The interaction between these operators and their respective impacts on the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) means that the final state is influenced by both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
