  "Problem": "Consider a thermodynamic system where the temperature \\( T \\) inside a reactor is controlled by a function \\( u(t, T) = kT + c \\), where \\( k \\) and \\( c \\) are constants. Here, \\( k \\) represents a proportional control on the temperature, and \\( c \\) is a constant heating term. We explore scenarios applying a linear transformation function \\( v(T) = mT + n \\) where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are constants, altering \\( T \\) at various instants.\n\nIf \\( v(T) \\) is applied to the reactor temperature \\( T_0 \\) at t = 0, and then \\( T \\) is allowed to evolve under \\( u(t, T) \\) without further intervention, will the temperature \\( T(t) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( T_0 \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( u(t, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\( v(T) = mT + n \\) modifies the baseline temperature \\( T_0 \\) to \\( mT_0 + n \\), which changes the initial conditions for the control function \\( u(t, T) \\). The proportional and constant terms in \\( u(t, T) \\) will therefore start from and act on this altered initial temperature, leading to a different temperature profile over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
