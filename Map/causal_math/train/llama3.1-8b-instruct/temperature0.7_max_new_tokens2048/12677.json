  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes a transformation through an integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is the input function to the system.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) precisely at any s < T after observing \\\\( T[f](T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation integral and the matrix exponential modify the original function in a way that makes it impossible to reconstruct \\\\( f(s) \\\\) directly from \\\\( T[f](T) \\\\) without additional information on the transformation or the original function's characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
