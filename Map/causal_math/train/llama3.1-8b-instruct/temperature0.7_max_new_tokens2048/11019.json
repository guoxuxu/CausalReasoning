  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We will explore scenarios using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as an integral transformation \\\\( L(g)(t) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} g(s) ds \\\\) with constant \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf another function \\\\( g(z) = e^{bz} \\\\) where \\\\( b \\\\) is a different constant, is applied as an intervention during the transformation by \\\\( L \\\\), would the result solely depend on the original parameter \\\\( a \\\\) of function \\\\( f \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{bz} \\\\) as an intervention involves modifying the functional form before applying \\\\( L \\\\). The new transformation would now consider both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) parameters leading to a combined effect on the outcome. Therefore, the final integrated result is influenced by both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), not just \\\\( a \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
