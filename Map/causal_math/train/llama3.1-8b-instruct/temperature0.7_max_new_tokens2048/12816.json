  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = Cz(t) \\\\), where C is a constant complex number. We explore the effect of the Laplace transformation on this function, defined by \\\\( L[z](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), focusing on how this transform influences the behavior and conclusions about the system.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transformation to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), followed by allowing the system to evolve according to \\\\( z'(t) = Cz(t) \\\\) without any intervention, change the expression of the transformed function compared to directly transforming the system's output at any given time?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the solution to \\\\( z'(t) = Cz(t) \\\\) will be the same regardless of when it is applied because the transformation itself does not alter the differential equation governing the system. The transform just captures the behavior across the entire evolution without altering the time dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
