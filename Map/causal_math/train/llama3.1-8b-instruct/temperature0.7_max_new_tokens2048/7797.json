  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with an inductor, resistor, and capacitor arranged in series (RLC circuit). The voltage across the circuit is governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C}i = V(t) \\\\), where \\\\( L, R, C \\\\) are constants and \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is the input voltage function. We examine the effect of applying a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to the input voltage function.\n\nIf the input voltage function \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is modified using the Laplace Transform to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V)(s) \\\\), and then the circuit is allowed to operate under its differential equation without further alteration, will the current \\\\( i(t) \\\\) at time t follow the same path as if \\\\( V(t) \\\\) was directly applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace Transform changes the frequency-domain representation of the input voltage and thus alters the entire solution of the differential equation in the time-domain. The system's response in terms of current \\\\( i(t) \\\\) will correspond to the inverse of the transformed voltage, thus altering the original current path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
