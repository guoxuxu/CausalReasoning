  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze changes in solution behavior under the influence of the transformation \\\\( v(x,t) = e^{\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( w(x,T) \\\\) at time T, can we identify the transformations applied (both \\\\( e^{\\\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\gamma t} \\\\)) merely by knowing the condition at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of exponential factors applied at different times (before and during evolution) creates a scenario where multiple sets of values for \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) could lead to the same final observed state, due to the complex interplay and overlap of the scaling effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
