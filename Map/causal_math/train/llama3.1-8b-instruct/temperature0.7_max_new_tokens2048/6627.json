  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants, representing the real and imaginary parts of the exponent, respectively. We examine the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) on this function and how alterations to parameters impact the system dynamics.\n\nIf we introduce an intervention by applying another transformation, say, a Fourier transform to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after applying the Laplace transform, will the final output at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) depend only on the original parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), and not on the transformation properties?",
  "Explanation": "The final output in the frequency domain after applying a Fourier transform to the Laplace transform of the function will depend on the effects and properties of both transformations. These transformations interact, affecting amplitude and phase differently; thus, the final characteristics aren't solely dictated by the original exponential parameters but also by how these transformations modulate the signals.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
