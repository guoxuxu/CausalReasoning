  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We evaluate how the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affects the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIs it possible to determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 from the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), any exponential scaling due to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) cannot be disentangled from the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\). This makes it indeterminate whether the observed state accumulated changes due to scaling or purely from the rotational dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
