  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int \\\\frac{f(w)}{w - z} dw \\\\), where \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is an analytic function defined on a complex domain excluding the point z. The integral is calculated over a closed contour enclosing z. We want to infer changes and effects of applying transformations based on the function \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf another function transformation \\\\( j(w) = e^{i\\\\phi}w \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is another real constant) is applied to the contour during the integration process, will the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) only depend on the original function \\\\( f(w) \\\\) without bearing effects of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both \\\\( h(w) \\\\) and \\\\( j(w) \\\\) are rotational transformations which, when applied to the contour over which the integral is taken, do not affect the value of an integral of an analytic function enclosed by the contour. Thus, the result of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is determined solely by the properties of \\\\( f(w) \\\\), uninfluenced by \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
