  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We evaluate the function under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(u) du \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( g(h(z)) \\\\), is it possible to precisely trace back to the original z or distinguish between transformations like \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) = z^3 \\\\), just using the output?",
  "Explanation": "Distinguishing between transformations based solely on \\\\( g(h(z)) \\\\) is not feasible, as both \\\\( z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( z^3 \\\\) or other polynomial transformations may lead to similar integral results. Multiple transformations can lead to the same resulting function value due to the nature of complex function integrals over variable and complex paths.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
