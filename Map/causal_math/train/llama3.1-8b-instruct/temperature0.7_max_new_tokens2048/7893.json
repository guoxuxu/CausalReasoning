  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iCs}z(s) ds \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) at t = 0 modify the terminal value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) compared to if no transformation was applied and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolved purely under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) calculates a new function based on the history of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) but does not alter the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) itself which is governed by the differential equation. Thus, the terminal value \\\\( z(T) \\\\) remains unchanged by the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
