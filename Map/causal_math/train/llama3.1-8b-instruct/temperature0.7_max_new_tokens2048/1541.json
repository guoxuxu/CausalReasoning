  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a circular motion in the complex plane. We then examine the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) and the system evolves under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) without further intervention, will the system's state at a later time \\\\( t = \\pi \\\\) be identical to evolving the system without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the initial conditions by squaring the complex number, changing its magnitude and phase. Specifically, the transformation affects the trajectory such that the final point corresponding to \\\\( t = \\pi \\\\) will not be the same, as \\\\( g \\\\) modifies both the period and the amplitude of the oscillation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
