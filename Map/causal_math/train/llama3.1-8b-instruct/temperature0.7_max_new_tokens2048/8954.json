  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) is applied to a complex variable z, where A is a complex constant. The effect of this transformation over time, modeled by \\\\( z(t) = f(z(t-1)) \\\\\\), is assessed with and without interventions.\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which forms a spiral, can we confirm that the series of transformations started with \\\\( z_0 = 0 \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory forming a spiral could start from any z on the complex plane, not necessarily from zero. The initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) does not uniquely determine the spiraling behavior since any non-zero \\\\( z_0 \\\\) can lead to a spiral pattern under repeated applications of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z_0 → z(1); A → z(1); z(1) → z(2); z(2) → z(3);...; z(t) → z(t+1); z(t) → spiral; spiral → started with z_0 = 0"
