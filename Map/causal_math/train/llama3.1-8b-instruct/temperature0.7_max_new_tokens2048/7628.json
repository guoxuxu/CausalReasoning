  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) in a complex domain using a Laplace Transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x)\\\\} = U(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. This scenario investigates the implications of the reversal of this transformation and the intervention of modifying the transform function.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( V(s) = s U(s) \\\\) which transforms back to \\\\( v(x) \\\\), can we deduce that the intervention was definitely the operation \\\\( s \\\\) multiplying \\\\( U(s) \\\\), based strictly on observing \\\\( v(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( V(s) = s U(s) \\\\) does suggest a differentiation operation in the time domain, the result \\\\( v(x) \\\\) being the derivative of some function does not uniquely confirm the intervention without ambiguity. Different operations in other domains (like adding zeros or differentiating multiple times) could also yield a similar \\\\( v(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
