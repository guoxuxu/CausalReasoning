  "Problem": "Consider the discrete-time system defined by the equation \\\\(y(n+1) = A y(n)\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We are interested in the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Bx\\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we trace back accurately to the original vector \\\\(y_0\\\\) after observing the state \\\\(y(N)\\\\) at n = N, without knowing if the transformation \\\\(g(y)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\(B\\\\), the transformation \\\\(g\\\\) that might have occurred at the initial state makes it difficult to uniquely reconstruct \\\\(y_0\\\\). Since \\\\(B\\\\) might have changed the initial conditions irreversibly, deduction of \\\\(y_0\\\\) from \\\\(y(N)\\\\) is uncertain without additional data on \\\\(B\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
