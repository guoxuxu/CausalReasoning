  "Problem": "Consider a quantum system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system. We examine changes due to the operation of the unitary transformation \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iH't} \\\\), where \\\\( H' \\\\) is another Hamiltonian.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( V(t) = e^{-iKt} \\\\) (where K is a different constant Hamiltonian) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on H and not on \\\\( H' \\\\) or K?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with V(t) at time t_1 modifies the evolution by introducing another Hamiltonian, K. As a result, the final state at time T is dependent not only on the original Hamiltonian H but also significantly influenced by the effects of \\\\( H' \\\\) and K through the respective unitary evolutions \\\\( U(t) \\\\) and \\\\( V(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
