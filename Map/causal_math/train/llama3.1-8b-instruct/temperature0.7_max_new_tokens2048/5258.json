  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We explore the scenario where a transformation by the function \\\\( g(u) = U(t)u \\\\), with \\\\( U(t) \\\\) being a unitary operator, is conducted.\n\nGiven observation of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the original function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), specifically whether a unitary transformation \\\\( U(t) \\\\) was applied, it's not possible to uniquely trace back to \\\\( u_0 \\\\). This is because the unitary operator could modify \\\\( u_0 \\\\) in a way that is preserved during the evolution but not inversely traceable without additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
