  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) and its original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). We are scrutinizing the influence of a linear operator \\\\( T \\\\) operating on \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( T[f(t)] = t \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\).\n\nUpon observing the transformed result \\\\( L[T[f(t)]] = -F'(s) \\\\), can we determine that the initial function was precisely \\\\( f(t) \\\\) multiplied by \\\\( t \\\\) without any other modifications?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific transformation properties of the Laplace Transform, the resulting function \\\\( -F'(s) \\\\) uniquely identifies the operation in the time domain as multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\). This is due to the one-to-one nature of the particular transform operation used, allowing clear inference from effect back to cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
