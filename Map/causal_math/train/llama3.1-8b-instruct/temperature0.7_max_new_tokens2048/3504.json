  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) over a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), and an external heat source function \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) is introduced that affects the temperature. The impact of heat source transformation defined by \\\\( u(x,t) = u(x,t) + h(x,t) \\\\) on temperature distribution is analyzed.\n\nGiven the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) and knowing an intervention changed the heat source at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine precisely which heat source functions \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) or \\\\( h'(x,t) \\\\) were applied before and after \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific forms of \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) and \\\\( h'(x,t) \\\\) based solely on the final temperature distribution is highly complex due to the superposition of effects and possible similarities in heat contribution over different intervals.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
