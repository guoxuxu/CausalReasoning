  "Problem": "Consider a complex function of the form \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. These equations describe the dynamics of two separate systems. We explore the effect of applying the integral transform \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-\\\\tau)C} f(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with C being a constant matrix, on these systems.\n\nGiven the transformed state of the system at time t, \\\\( z^T(t) \\\\), is it possible to deduce the original states \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) at t = 0 before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the initial states \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( y_0 \\\\) from the transformed system state \\\\( z^T(t) \\\\) is not directly feasible without additional information. The transformation \\\\( T[f] \\\\) integrates and modifies the original path based on past system dynamics and the matrix C, obscuring direct reverse calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
