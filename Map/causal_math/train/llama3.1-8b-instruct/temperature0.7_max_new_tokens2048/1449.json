  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t represents time. We investigate the influence of a Fourier transformation on this function, represented as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) over the frequency domain \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is Fourier transformed without additional modification, will the primary frequency component in the Fourier domain be influenced by the initial phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The primary frequency component of the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) will consistently revolve around the frequency point \\\\( \\\\omega = 1 \\\\) regardless of the initial phase, since the exponential function's nature ensures that it fundamentally manifests its frequency through its exponential term, unaffected by alteration in initial phase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
