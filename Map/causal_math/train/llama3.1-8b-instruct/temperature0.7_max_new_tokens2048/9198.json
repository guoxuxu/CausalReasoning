  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nBased on observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowledge of whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), deducing the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is not feasible given that \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) could distort the initial state in a manner untraceable backwards, especially if \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( P \\\\) do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
