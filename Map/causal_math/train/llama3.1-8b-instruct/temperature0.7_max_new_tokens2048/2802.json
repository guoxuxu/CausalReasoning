  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and x is the initial condition vector. We explore the impact of the operator \\\\( h(z) = Re^{Ft}z \\\\), where R is a complex matrix function and F a constant matrix, applied over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, distinguishing whether the trajectory was modified by R at t = 0 is not feasible. The transformation \\\\( R \\\\) and its interaction with C through \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) can lead to multiple potential initial vectors x, creating ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
