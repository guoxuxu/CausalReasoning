  "Problem": "We are studying a complex function \\\\( z = f(x+iy) \\\\) where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function \\\\( f \\\\) is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore how transformations such as \\\\( g(z) = z + B \\\\) (with B as a constant complex matrix) affect the output of \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nFrom knowing the final state \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations were applied (whether none, \\\\( g \\\\), \\\\( h \\\\), or both), just by examining \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( f(z(T)) \\\\) could result from several combinations of transformations or none, depending on the specific matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) and their interplay with \\\\( A \\\\). The overlapping effects and possible non-unique mappings due to exponential function properties mean we cannot definitively infer the interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
