  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\). Analyzing the impact of the inverse transformation given by \\\\( g(t) = L^{-1}\\\\{G(s)\\\\} \\\\) where \\\\( G(s) = sF(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine whether the transformation \\\\( G(s) \\\\), \\\\( H(s) \\\\), or both were applied at any point during the process, solely by observing \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at the end of the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Determining whether \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( H(s) \\\\) or both were applied cannot be conclusively ascertained just by observing the final \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The transformations influence the derivatives independently, but the inverse process doesn't uniquely resolve which operations were applied initially without additional data on transformation timings or sequences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
