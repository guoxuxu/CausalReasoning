  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the wave equation in a one-dimensional domain, defined as \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) describes the displacement at position \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is the wave speed. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to the initial conditions.\n\nGiven only the Fourier-transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we exactly reconstruct the original initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing the wave speed \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the wave speed \\\\( c \\\\), the specific way in which each frequency component evolves back to the original time cannot be determined accurately. Knowledge of \\\\( c \\\\) is essential to correctly backtrack each frequency component's evolution, which affects the ability to reconstruct the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
