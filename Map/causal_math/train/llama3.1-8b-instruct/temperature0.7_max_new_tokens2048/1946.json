  "Problem": "Assume a linear algebra context where we define the operation \\\\( L(v) = Sv \\\\) and \\\\( M(v) = Tv \\\\), with S and T being constant matrices. The system evolves according to the vector field defined by \\\\( L \\\\) initially, and we explore various modifications and impacts using the transformation \\\\( M \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) after evolving starting from either \\\\( v_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Tv_0 \\\\) under \\\\( L(v) = Sv \\\\), can we determine if the original vector was precisely \\\\( v_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( M \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( M \\\\) was applied initially or not, the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) could modify the starting condition in a way that could lead to multiple possible original vectors. This uncertainty is especially true if \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) have overlapping spectral properties, complicating reverse inference.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
