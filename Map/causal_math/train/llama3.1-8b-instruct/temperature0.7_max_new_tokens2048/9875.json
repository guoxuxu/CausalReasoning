  "Problem": "Consider a control system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and B is a control matrix. An integral transformation with kernel K(x, s) is applied to the state x, yielding a transformed state \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(x(s), s) ds\\\\).\n\nSuppose an additional controlling effect via a matrix C is added at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), modifying the system to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu + Cv\\\\). Will the transformed state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original system parameters A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new control matrix C as an intervention at time t_1 modifies the system dynamics, and thus affects the state x(t) and consequently z(T). The contribution of C cannot be ignored as it impacts the state trajectory past t_1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
