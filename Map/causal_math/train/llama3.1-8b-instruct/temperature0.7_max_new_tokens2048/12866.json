  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s\\\\omega} z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period from 0 to T.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T z(s) ds \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the function at t = T depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not the effects of the transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) interacts with the effects of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), resulting in a function at t = T that reflects the cumulative impact of both transformations, thus making it dependent on both and not merely on the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
