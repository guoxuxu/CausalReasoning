  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time is investigated.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)g(t)\\\\} (s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine whether the intervention \\\\( g(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) was applied, based solely on the transform outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)g(t)\\\\} (s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega - \\\\alpha} \\\\) explicitly indicates an additional term \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) in the exponent, which can only result from the multiplicative intervention function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), revealing that an intervention indeed occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
