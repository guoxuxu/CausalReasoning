  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system defined by a Laplace transform \\\\( L[s] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}y(t) dt \\\\), where y(t) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\\\), with K being a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of applying an exponential matrix function \\\\( h(y) = e^{Dt} y \\\\) where D is another constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a function \\\\( j(y) = e^{Ft} y \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( L[s] \\\\) of \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on \\\\( K \\\\) and not \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\\\( j(y) \\\\) introduces a new transformation factor at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), impacting the trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\). This results in the final state being dependent on the matrices D, F, and K, especially due to the compound effects of expoenential matrix functions modifying the system at different stages.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
