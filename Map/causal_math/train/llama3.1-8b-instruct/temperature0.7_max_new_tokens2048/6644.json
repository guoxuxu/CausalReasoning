  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant matrix, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect how the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\) affects the system's behavior over time t, where B is also a real constant matrix.\n\nWith the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) observed, can we accurately deduce which transformations were applied (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) merely by analyzing the state at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of complex exponential transformations involving real matrices, and their effects on the trajectory of complex functions, multiple combinations of \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) values, and different timings and sequences of their application, could yield the same observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The overlapping potential effects and transformations prevent precise identification of the interventions used based solely on the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
