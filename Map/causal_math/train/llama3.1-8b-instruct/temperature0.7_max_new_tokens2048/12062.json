  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) and A is a matrix. We analyze the causal effect of a matrix intervention \\\\( B \\\\) on function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+B)t} \\\\) and its corresponding transformed function over time.\n\nIf an intervention applies a new matrix C at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), so the function changes to \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+C)t} \\\\), will the resulting transform \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) at T > t_1 be independent of the initial matrices A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention leads to a new function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+C)t} \\\\), and the resulting transformation \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) will contain the effects of C along with the initial matrix A. The transformation's result at any time T > t_1 is influenced by both A and C, and potentially B if it affects conditions preceding t_1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
