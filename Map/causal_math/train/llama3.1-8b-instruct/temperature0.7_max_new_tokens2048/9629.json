  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real constant matrix and z a complex number. We study the behavior of this function when subject to transformations and analyze the inverse Laplace transformation which is given by \\\\( F(p) = L^{-1} \\\\{ f(z) \\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the system evolves naturally with the inverse Laplace transform applied, is the resulting function \\\\( F(p) \\\\) at p solely dependent on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform \\\\( F(p) \\\\) directly depends on the form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) which is defined explicitly by \\\\( A \\\\) and the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). There are no other variables introduced, thus the resulting function is solely dependent on \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
