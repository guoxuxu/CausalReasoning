  "Problem": "Analyze a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a matrix representing the system's dynamics. We consider the effect of introducing a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial state, which alters the state's frequency components.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\(x_0\\\\) and the new state \\\\(x'_0 = \\\\mathcal{F}(x_0)\\\\) is then evolved under the system's dynamics without further intervention, will the system's state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time T differ from directly evolving \\\\(x_0\\\\) under the system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform shifts the frequency components of the initial state, potentially altering how those components evolve under the system's linear operator L. This generally leads to a different system state at time T, as the spectral properties of L will affect the transformed components differently compared to the original ones.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
