  "Problem": "Consider an engineering structure subject to a loading and unloading sequence. Its response is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + k u = f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) is the displacement, \\\\( c \\\\) is the damping coefficient, \\\\( k \\\\) is the stiffness, and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents the external force applied to the system. We analyze the model's behavior under the transformation \\\\( h(u) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) u \\\\) over time, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies the external force to \\\\( g(t) = \\\\cos(\\\\beta t)f(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant), will the resulting displacement \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the stiffness \\\\( k \\\\) and not on the damping \\\\( c \\\\) or the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the system's driving force, and the resulting displacement at time T will depend not only on the stiffness \\\\( k \\\\) but also on the damping coefficient \\\\( c \\\\) and the effects of the initial transformation. The interaction between the damping, the altered force, and any initial condition modifications affects the response in a complex manner.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
