  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of the Laplace transform on this function, represented as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\) for \\\\( s \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the modified Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z'(t)\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i(\\omega+\\delta)} \\\\), can we determine exactly the values of both \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) used in the intervention, knowing only this transform result?",
  "Explanation": "The modified Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i(\\omega+\\delta)} \\\\) indicates a combined effect of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) in the exponential term. However, without separate knowledge of either \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\delta \\\\), we cannot uniquely split the combined effect into its individual components,\\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\delta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
