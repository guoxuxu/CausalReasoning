  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix. The transformation \\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), with \\( B \\) also a constant matrix, is applied at time \\( t \\). We explore the effect of this transformation on the system's evolution.\n\nIs it possible to infer the initial state \\( z_0 \\) from the state \\( z(T) \\) when the transformation; \\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\), might or might not have been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certain knowledge of the application of the transformation \\( e^{Bt}z \\), the state \\( z(T) \\) could result from various initial conditions modified by \\( e^{Bt} \\), complicating the determination of the precise \\( z_0 \\), especially if \\( B \\) affects the system significantly in ways that do not reverse easily.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
