  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\).\n\nKnowing the integral result \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) up to some final time T, is it possible to determine precisely at which time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) the frequency shifted from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) and what the values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) were?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation provides a cumulative measure over time, which blurs individual contributions from different segments of the function's evolution. Different combinations of shift times \\\\( t_1 \\\\), frequencies \\\\( \\omega \\\\), and \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) could potentially yield the same final integral result, making it impossible to uniquely determine these parameters from \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
