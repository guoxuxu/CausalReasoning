  "Problem": "Investigate the causal inference in an electrical circuit with a complex function impedance represented by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{sC} + Ls \\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(L\\\\) are the capacitance and inductance respectively. We will examine the effect of a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), which transforms the input current source \\\\( i(t) \\\\) through a Laplace transform with a added constant shift in the s-plane, \\\\( i(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(i(t)) + k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the voltage \\\\( v(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the transformations and interventions used (both the Laplace shift \\\\( k \\\\) and the addition \\\\( d \\\\)) solely by analyzing the output voltage \\\\( v(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nonlinearity and the compound transformations involved (both Laplace shift and constant addition), the end voltage \\\\( v(T) \\\\) could result from various combinations of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\). Differentiating between these combinations based only on the output voltage is not feasible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
