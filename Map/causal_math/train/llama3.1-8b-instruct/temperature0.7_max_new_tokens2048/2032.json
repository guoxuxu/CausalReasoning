  "Problem": "Let's consider a mathematical model where a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) satisfies the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\\\(V(x)\\\\) and examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform on \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed wave function \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(k, T)\\\\) at time T, can we unequivocally determine if and when the potential function was altered from \\\\( V(x) \\\\) to \\\\( V'(x) \\\\) based purely on the transformed function?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transformed function \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(k, T)\\\\) integrates effects over the entire evolution period and does not distinctly reveal specific moments or the nature of interventions such as potential changes. The transformation, being global, masks the precise timing and nature of any such changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
