  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} B u(s) ds \\), representing the output of a linear time-invariant system with state-space matrices A and B, and input \\( u(t) \\). Let's explore how the introduction of a transformation \\( f(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\), where C and D are constant matrices, affects the system.\n\nIf an intervention is implemented by altering the input function \\( u(t) \\) to \\( g(t) = e^{Mt}u(t) \\) at a point \\( t_1 \\), will the output \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) only depend on A and B?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration \\( g(t) = e^{Mt}u(t) \\) of the input introduces a new factor impacting the entire system. The output \\( z(T) \\) will thus be swayed by A, B, and now M as well. The intervention changes the system's response dynamics due to the changed input function, making the output dependent on these new parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
