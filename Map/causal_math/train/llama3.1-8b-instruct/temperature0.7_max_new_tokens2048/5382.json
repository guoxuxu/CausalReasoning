  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s) \\\\). Let us examine the causal effects and inferences in systems characterized by convolution and multiplication operations in the Laplace domain leading to end solutions in time domain.\n\nGiven the Laplace domain representation \\\\( H(s)G(s) \\\\), can we precisely deduce both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) separately without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the multiplicative nature of the transformation (Laplace), knowing \\\\( H(s)G(s) \\\\) alone does not allow for unique determination of both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) separately. Each function could potentially have multiple valid forms that satisfy the product in the Laplace domain, given the non-uniqueness of inverse transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
