  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) obey the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. We explore the scenario by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for some T > t_1 (after applying the perturbation \\\\( p(t) \\\\)), is it possible to infer the specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and constant B used in \\\\( p(t) \\\\) just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect observed at time T could result from varying the parameters B and \\\\( t_1 \\\\) in different ways, due to the nature of exponential functions and differential equations. There are potentially multiple combinations of \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and B that could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making precise determination ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
