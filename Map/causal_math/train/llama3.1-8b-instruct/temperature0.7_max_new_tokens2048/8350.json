  "Problem": "Consider a linear differential equation system described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(x) = P^{-1}e^{Qt}Px \\\\) over time t, where P and Q are constant matrices and \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) denotes the matrix exponential of Q.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) because the transformation could have modified the initial state in a non-invertible way, especially if the matrices Q and D have non-commuting effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
