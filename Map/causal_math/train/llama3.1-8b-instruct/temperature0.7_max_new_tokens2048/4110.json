  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Byt \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Dxt^2 \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We analyze the system's behavior with respect to an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\) applied at an initial time 0.\n\nAfter observing the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine whether the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without further data on the initial or intermediate states?",
  "Explanation": "Given only the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and without additional information about the trajectory or initial conditions, it is impossible to determine if the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied. The resultant point could theoretically be reached through various trajectories given different initial conditions and external influences.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
