  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where both A and B are constant matrices. To study the behavior of the system, an integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, with s being a complex parameter.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( h(z)(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely the time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) at which the intervention changing A to A' occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation by nature masks the specific instants at which changes occur within the system, as it summarizes the entire evolution up to T. Therefore, we cannot precisely pinpoint the intervention time just by observing \\\\( h(z)(T) \\\\), as it is obfuscated by the integral's accumulative nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
