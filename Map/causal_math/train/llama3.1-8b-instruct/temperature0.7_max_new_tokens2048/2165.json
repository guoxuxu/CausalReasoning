  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( ω \\\\) is a constant real number. The transformation applied on this function is given by \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a fixed positive integer. We investigate the impact of this transformation on the function's behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the original function without further intervention, will the outcome at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was evolved to t = T under just the original function?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) fundamentally modifies the function. Specifically, transforming \\\\( e^{iωt} \\\\) by \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) leads to \\\\( (e^{iωt})^n = e^{inωt} \\\\), which alters the frequency of oscillation. Therefore, the behavior at time T will differ from merely evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without the transformation, due to the change in frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
