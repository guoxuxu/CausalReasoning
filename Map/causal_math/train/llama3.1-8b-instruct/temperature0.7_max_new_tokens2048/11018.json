  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We will explore scenarios using a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as an integral transformation \\\\( L(g)(t) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} g(s) ds \\\\) with constant \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( L(f)(t) \\\\) for a specific \\\\( t \\\\), can we deduce the value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) originally applied in \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\) without any further information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral operator \\\\( L \\\\) transforms \\\\( f \\\\) into a function that integrates out the particulars of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), retaining only parameters that affect the integral’s general form such as \\\\( a \\\\). Thus, it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the transformed outcome alone due to the loss of information incurred during integration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
