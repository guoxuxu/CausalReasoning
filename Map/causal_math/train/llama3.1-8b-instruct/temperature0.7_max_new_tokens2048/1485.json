  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform operation on a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and how it interacts with a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + u\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and \\\\( u \\\\) is an external input. The causal inference is about the effect of changes in \\\\( u \\\\) through a time-dependent control function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), which is applied before taking the Laplace Transform.\n\nIf the control function \\\\( h(t) = e^{Et} \\\\) (with E as a constant matrix) is applied to the input \\\\( u \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + u \\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace Transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) be equivalent as if \\\\( u \\\\) was the only input applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(t) \\\\) influences \\\\( u \\\\), thus altering the overall input to the system. This change affects the system dynamics, manifesting in a different response in the Laplace domain. The multiplication by \\\\( e^{Et} \\\\) may significantly alter the characteristic roots in the transformed domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
