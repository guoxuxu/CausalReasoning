  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We assess how the behavior of the system changes if a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Mt}x \\\\), with M a constant matrix, is applied at different moments.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if it's unknown whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The system's evolution could have started from different initial states depending on whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied or not. Without knowing the action of \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\), the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced from \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
