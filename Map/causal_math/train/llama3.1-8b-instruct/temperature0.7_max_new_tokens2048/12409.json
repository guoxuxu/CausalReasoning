  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a linear integral transformation defined by \\\\(I[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sA} f(s) ds\\\\) where A is a constant matrix and f is a vector-valued function. We assess the effect of a function perturbation on the transformed system where \\\\(f(s)\\\\) is replaced by \\\\(g(s) = e^{Bs} f(s)\\\\), with B being another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the output of the integral transformation at T for \\\\(g(s)\\\\), can we infer the original function \\\\(f(s)\\\\) used at the initial time if \\\\(e^{Bs}\\\\) was applied but not necessarily known?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the transformation \\\\(e^{Bs}\\\\) applied to \\\\(f(s)\\\\), recovering the original form of \\\\(f(s)\\\\) simply from the transformed output is impractical. The alteration by \\\\(e^{Bs}\\\\) adds exponential complexity that modifies s-dependent behavior, making backward deduction challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
