  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation in a complex domain, \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), for a function \\\\( u: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\). We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to an initial condition \\\\( u_0(z) \\\\), evaluated at complex number z, and how its impact is observed over space without and with additional transformations.\n\nGiven the system's resultant state \\\\( u(z) \\\\) after interventions, can we determine precisely what interventions (Fourier transform, \\\\( T(u) \\\\), or both) were used, based solely on observing the outcome \\\\( u(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the result \\\\( u(z) \\\\) is highly challenging without additional information. The effects of the Fourier transform and the exponential shift due to \\\\( T(u) \\\\) can create a variety of potential spectral and spatial distributions, making unique identification of interventions impossible based on the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
