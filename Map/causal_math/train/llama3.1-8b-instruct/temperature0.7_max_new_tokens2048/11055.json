  "Problem": "We consider a complex function transformation in the context of an integral transformation. The initial function is \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an original real-valued function. We analyze applying a transformation \\\\( h(t) = k(t) * f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( * \\\\) denotes convolution with a kernel \\\\( k(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function transformation \\\\( j(t) = m(t) * h(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( m(t) \\\\) is another convolution kernel) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( g(z) \\\\) depend solely on the original transformation function imperatives and not on \\\\( k(t) \\\\) or \\\\( m(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( j(t) \\\\) adds yet another layer of convolution, which significantly impacts the final state of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The endpoint will depend not just on the properties of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) but also nuances introduced by \\\\( k(t) \\\\) and \\\\( m(t) \\\\), affecting the convolution's outcome and thus, \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
