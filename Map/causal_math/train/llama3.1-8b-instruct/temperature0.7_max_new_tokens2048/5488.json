  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. This system is influenced by transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we pinpoint precisely what interventions (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, by just observing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be derived from various combinations of interventions due to the non-commutative nature of the exponentials with complex terms. Different values of Q and R could lead to overlapping effects, making it impossible to distinguish between individual or combined interventions based solely on the observed endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
