  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We introduce a control function \\\\( h(x,t) = Kx \\\\), where K is a constant matrix, to modify the system's state.\n\nCan we deduce the original state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(x,t) \\\\), it's unclear whether the observed state at t = T was evolved from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Kx_0 \\\\). This ambiguity makes it impossible to uniquely determine the original state vector without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
