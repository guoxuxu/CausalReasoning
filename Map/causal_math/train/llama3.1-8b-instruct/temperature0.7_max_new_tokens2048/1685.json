  "Problem": "Consider a wave propagation described by the second order partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial^2 u / \\\\partial t^2 = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\) with a perturbation function \\\\(f(u) = u e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf \\\\(f(u)\\\\) is applied to an initial wave profile \\\\(u_0\\\\) at time t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under the wave equation without further intervention, will the wave profile \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u_0\\\\) were evolved directly for time T under the original wave equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(u) = u e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial conditions of the wave equation. The exponential growth term \\\\(e^{\\\\lambda t}\\\\) will amplify the wave differently than under normal conditions, leading to a different wave profile at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
