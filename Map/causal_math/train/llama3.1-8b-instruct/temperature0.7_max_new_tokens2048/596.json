  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex scalar. A transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{mz}\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(m\\\\) is a complex scalar.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we deduce exactly which interventions were applied (\\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(k(z)\\\\), or both), knowing only \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) might be reachable through different combinations of the interventions due to the non-linearities introduced by the exponential and additive transformations in the complex plane. Hence, we cannot determine the interventions uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
