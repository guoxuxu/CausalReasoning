  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex square matrix, binding the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) of a complex variable. We analyze the behavior when applying a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf an intervention occurs by substituting \\\\( A \\\\) with a different matrix \\\\( B \\\\) during the computation of \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} \\\\) after starting from \\\\( z_0 \\\\), would the transformed output depend solely on the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\) at any point of time?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the matrix from \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( B \\\\) mid-computation introduces a new dynamic into the system, manipulating both the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and its resultant transformation. This change affects the entire transform making it dependent not only on \\\\( A \\\\) but significantly on \\\\( B \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
