  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\\\) is a real constant. The function describes a point moving in a complex plane. We explore the relationship between linear transformations given by matrices and their effects on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) at time T, can we precisely back-calculate to confirm both transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\\\) and \\\\( R(z) \\\\\\) applied at times 0 and \\\\( t_1 \\\\\\) respectively?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential for different transformations (A and B) to produce equivalent effects on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\\\) and overlapping impacts on amplitude and phase, it is impossible to distinctly identify the sequence of transformations applied just from the final observation \\\\( z(T) \\\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
