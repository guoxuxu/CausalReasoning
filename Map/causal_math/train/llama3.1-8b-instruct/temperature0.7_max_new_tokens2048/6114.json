  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics problem where the velocity field of the fluid, represented by \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,t) \\\\), is manipulated through transformations \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\nabla \\\\psi \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\psi \\\\) is a scalar potential function varying with spatial coordinates and time. The fluid is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations under incompressible flow conditions.\n\nAfter observing the fluid state at time t = T, can we determine if the transformation \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity and potential chaotic behavior in fluid dynamics governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, it is generally impossible to unequivocally infer the initial application of a transformation like \\\\( f(\\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\) solely based on subsequent observations, particularly in the absence of data about initial conditions and due to potential nonlinear interactions in the flow.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t = T → observed_fluid_state; observed_fluid_state → f(\\mathbf{v}); f(\\mathbf{v}) → \\mathbf{v}(x,t); \\mathbf{v}(x,t) → Navier-Stokes equations; Navier-Stokes equations → fluid flow behavior; fluid flow behavior → \\nabla \\psi; \\nabla \\psi → \\psi; \\psi → f(\\mathbf{v})"
