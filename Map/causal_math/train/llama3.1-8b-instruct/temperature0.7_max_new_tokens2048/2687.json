  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact through a Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\( F(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real-valued angular frequency, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is first modified by a damping function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive damping constant, and then transformed to \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\), will \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\) only represent the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) effects modified by \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The modification by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) adds a damping effect, influencing the amplitude and potentially the phase of the frequency components. The resulting Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) reflects both the original oscillatory behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) combined with the exponential damping, specifically at each frequency including \\\\( \\omega_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
