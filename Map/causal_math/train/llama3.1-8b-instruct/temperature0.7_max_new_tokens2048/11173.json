  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over a complex domain \\\\( z \\\\) described as \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + cz \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the impact of a complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real number representing rotation in the complex plane.\n\nIf a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane undergoes the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at t = 0, and then is mapped by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the resultant point \\\\( f(z(t)) \\\\) at time t = T differ from if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was directly applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) modifies the initial vector by rotation, and since the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) includes a quadratic term, the resultant point will depend on both magnitude and angle, hence differing from direct application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to the untransformed \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
