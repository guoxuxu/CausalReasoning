  "Problem": "Consider a dynamic system described by a Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) defined as \\\\(f(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(s) e^{ist} ds\\\\). The scenario explores how manipulations to \\\\( g(s) \\\\) affect the outcome of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over an interval.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is modified such that it includes a polynomial term, \\\\( p(s) \\\\), without any other intervention, will the resulting function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) demonstrate changes in its amplitude and phase at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a polynomial term to \\\\( g(s) \\\\) influences both the amplitude and oscillatory behavior of the Fourier transform, thus modifying the resultant function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) in both amplitude and phase compared to the Fourier transform of the original \\\\( g(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "modification of g(s) → inclusion of p(s); inclusion of p(s) → change in g(s); g(s) → f(t); change in g(s) → change in f(t); f(t) → amplitude and phase at time T"
