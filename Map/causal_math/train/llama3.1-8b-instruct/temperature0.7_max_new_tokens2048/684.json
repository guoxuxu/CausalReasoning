  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), representing a system's state in the complex plane, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. The system is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix.\n\nKnowing only the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to specify precisely which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the entire duration?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information about the times and types of interventions, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from numerous potential combinations of the transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at various times, especially given their complex exponential nature which might result in equivalent end states through different sequences of application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(T) → M; M → dz/dt; dz/dt → z(t); z(t) → x(t) and y(t); x(t) and y(t) → f(z) and g(z)",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The system's state at time T is determined by the constant complex matrix M, which in turn determines the system's rate of change over time."
