  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equation, simplified to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + (u \\\\cdot \\\\nabla)u = -\\\\nabla p + \\nu\\\\nabla^2u\\\\), where u is the velocity field, p is pressure, and ν is viscosity. Evaluate the behavior under a Fourier transform of the velocity field, represented as \\\\( F(u)(k) \\\\), where k is the wave number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\), \\\\( G(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the velocity field at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( F(u)(k, T) \\\\) could potentially result from different interventions because of the inherent complexity in the behavior of fluid flows and transformations applied. The non-linearity and sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters in the Navier-Stokes equation make it difficult to infer the exact nature and sequence of transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
