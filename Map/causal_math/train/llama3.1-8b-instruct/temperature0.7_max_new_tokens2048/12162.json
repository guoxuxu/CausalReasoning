  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation via a linear operator represented by an integral transformation \\\\( T[f(t)] = \\int h(t - \\tau)f(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is the system's impulse response function. The output after transformation is denoted \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the system undergoes a modification at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where a filter with impulse response \\\\( k(t) \\\\) is applied, will the system's output at \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) for an input \\\\( x(t) + \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) be independent of the initial impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new filter \\\\( k(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another layer of transformation, making the overall system response dependent on the convolution of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( k(t) \\\\), as well as the modifications introduced by \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\). The output state at \\\\( T \\\\) is a result of the combined effects of these transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
