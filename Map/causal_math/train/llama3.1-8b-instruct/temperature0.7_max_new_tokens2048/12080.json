  "Problem": "Let's consider a continuous system characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = -\\\\lambda u\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda > 0\\\\) specifies the system's response behavior. We investigate the effect of applying the Laplace transform on this system, with the Laplace transform defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}[u(t)](s) = U(s)\\\\).\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to the initial condition \\\\(u(0, x)\\\\), and then solve the transformed equation for \\\\(U(s, x)\\\\), will the resulting transformation, when inverted to time space using \\\\(u(t, x) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[U(s, x)]\\\\), yield the same solution as direct solving of the original partial differential equation without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse are linear operators that preserve the properties of linear differential equations. Solving the transformed equation and then applying the inverse transform results in the same solution as solving the original equation directly, provided there are no non-linear transformations involved.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
