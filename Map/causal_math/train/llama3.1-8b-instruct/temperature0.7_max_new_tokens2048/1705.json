  "Problem": "Examine the calculation of the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( u(t) = t^2 \\\\) which is then convolved with another function \\\\( v(t) = e^{-t} \\\\). The Laplace transform is a powerful integral transformation used in solving differential equations and analyzing systems responses.\n\nDoes the Laplace transform of the convolution of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) equal the product of their individual Laplace transforms without any additional modifications?",
  "Explanation": "In the theory of Laplace transforms, the transform of the convolution of two functions is equal to the product of their individual transforms. Thus, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u * v\\\\} = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u\\\\} \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v\\\\} \\\\), without any need for modifications or adjustments.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
