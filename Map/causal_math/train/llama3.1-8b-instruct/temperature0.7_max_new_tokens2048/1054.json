  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) represents the Fourier space variable, on the system's behavior over time.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0 without any information about intermediate transformations?",
  "Explanation": "If the system and its transformations are all linear, and the Fourier transformation is invertible (under suitable conditions such as absence of zero frequencies if assuming spatial decay of \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\)), then \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) can be uniquely determined from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform and using the known evolution under \\\\(L\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
