  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore how the application of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-ix\\\\xi} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system.\n\nAfter observing the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) in frequency domain at T, can we deduce precisely the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) in spatial domain at t = 0 without knowing other initial conditions or transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) precisely from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\) is generally not possible without additional information about the operator L and its effect in the frequency space, as the transformation and evolution could correspond to multiple potential initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
