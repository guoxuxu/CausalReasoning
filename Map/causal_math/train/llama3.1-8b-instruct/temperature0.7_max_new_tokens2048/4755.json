  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the heat distribution over a rod with length L is modeled by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where u is the temperature function, k is the thermal diffusion coefficient, and subscript denotes partial derivatives. The Fourier transform (denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{f}\\)) is used to analyze conditions and interventions on the temperature profile.\n\nIf between t = 0 and T, an intervention is made by applying a filter described by function \\\\(g(u) = e^{-st}u\\\\), where s is a decay parameter, will the system's behavior at time T depend solely on the thermal diffusion coefficient k and not on the details of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using the filter \\\\(g(u) = e^{-st}u\\\\) affects the evolving temperature distribution by introducing an exponential decay influenced by the parameter s. Thus, the heat distribution at time T would not only depend on the thermal properties defined by k but also significantly on the specifics of the intervention (the decay parameter s).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
