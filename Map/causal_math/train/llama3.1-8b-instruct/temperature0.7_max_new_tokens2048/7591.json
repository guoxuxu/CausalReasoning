  "Problem": "Evaluate the system of differential equations characterized by the Laplace transform of functions and their inverse. Let \\\\( X(s) \\\\) be the Laplace transform of a function x(t), and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) the transfer function of a linear system. The response of the system is given by \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is applied to the system output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) affects the final system response by altering the overall system characteristics. The final output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\), as these transformations modify the output in sequence, impacting the frequency and time-domain characteristics of the response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
