  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a set of functions defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) represents a rotation by A in the complex plane over time t. Additionally, let there be a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the rotation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 changes the initial condition to \\\\( e^{iB0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as time progresses, the factor \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) applies a different rotation compared to \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\). This results in a trajectory deviation, leading to a distinct endpoint at any time T ≠ 0.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
