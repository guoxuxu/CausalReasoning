  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nFrom the resultant function at t = T, can we precisely deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation involves integration with an altering factor \\\\( e^{s^2} \\\\), reversing this effect to uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) from the output at any t = T is generally not possible without additional information about the transformation specifics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
