  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the matrix differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Mx + u\\), where \\(M\\) is a constant matrix and \\(u\\) is a control input. We examine the influence of applying a transformation \\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\), with \\(N\\) being another constant matrix, on the system’s trajectory.\n\nIf a control input \\( u \\) defined as \\( u = e^{Kt}x \\), where \\( K \\) is another constant matrix, is applied as an intervention at a time \\( t_1 \\), will the trajectory of \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend exclusively on \\( M \\) rather than any transformation by \\( N \\) or \\( K \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( u = e^{Kt}x \\) introduces an additional dynamic to the system. This makes the resulting state \\( x(T) \\) dependent not only on \\( M \\) but also on the characteristics and interactions of \\( N \\) and \\( K \\). Each contributes uniquely through its influence on the state of the system over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
