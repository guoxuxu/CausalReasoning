  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane as \\(z(t) = e^{At}z_0\\), where \\(A\\) is a complex constant and \\(z_0\\) is the initial complex value. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation given by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) \\, ds \\) on the system, where \\(B\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\( T(z) \\) is applied to \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and then allowed to evolve under \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(T) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( z_0 \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\( T(z) \\) changes the initial state configuration since its outcome is influenced by the entire trajectory from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\). This transforms the initial condition which makes the solution path different from a direct evolution under \\( e^{At}z_0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
