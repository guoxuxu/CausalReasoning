  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We investigate the causality in the changes of original function and its behavior under various transformations.\n\nCan we correctly deduce the rate parameter \\\\( a \\\\) of the exponential function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) just by knowing its Laplace transform at a specific complex number \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the formula of the Laplace transform for an exponential function generally hints at the value of \\\\( a \\\\), it can only be confidently deduced if the form of the original function is strictly known as \\\\( e^{at} \\\\). In scenarios with mixed or modified inputs, or different combinations producing similar transforms, \\\\( a \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
