  "Problem": "In this system, we consider the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We will explore the consequences of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Ke^{Mt}z\\\\) where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(M\\\\) is another diagonalizable matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T be equivalent to if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was just directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(z)\\\\) changes the initial condition to \\\\(Ke^{M0}z_0 = Kz_0\\\\), altering the starting point of the system. Radiating effects due to the matrix \\\\(K\\\\) interfaced with \\\\(D\\\\)'s dynamics render the evolved state at time T distinct from merely advancing \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(D\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
