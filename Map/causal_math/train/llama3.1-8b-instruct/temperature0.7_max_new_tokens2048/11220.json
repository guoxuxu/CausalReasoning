  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( u(x, t) = e^{iwx - iwt} \\\\), a wave equation solution, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the effects of applying a differential operator \\\\( L = i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) to test causal relationships in transformations.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at some time T, can we deduce precisely which interventions (either \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or both) were employed only by observing the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of differential operators like \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) on the wave function might lead to the same resultant state under different configurations and sequences of application. Without additional information about the interventions' timelines or specifics, it's not feasible to uniquely identify the actions taken on the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
