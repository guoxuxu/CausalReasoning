  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transformation applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) described as \\\\( F(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) dt \\\\). We analyze the impact of the modification where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is initially multiplied by a squared modulus of another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), initiating as \\\\( g(t) = |h(t)|^2 f(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed using Fourier transformation without further modifications, will \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( f(t) \\\\) alone was transformed directly?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) will be affected by the initial multiplication by \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\), which modifies the frequency content of \\\\( f(t) \\\\). The resultant Fourier transform is a convolution of \\\\( F(f)(\\\\omega) \\\\) with the Fourier transform of \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\), indicating a different outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
