  "Problem": "Let's examine the interplay between two complex functions, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iωt} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = e^{-iωt} \\\\), in the context of a complex plane traversal. The complex exponentials represent rotation dynamics in the complex plane, with \\\\( ω \\\\) being a real constant.\n\nIf we initialize a system at \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) and allow it to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without intervention, will the trajectory at time T be the same as if we directly applied \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T to the initial point?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the exponential function and the lack of external influence, the natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) inherently traces out the arc \\\\( e^{iωt} \\\\), arriving at the same position at time T as if \\\\( z(T) = e^{iωT} \\\\) had been applied directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
