  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\), aiming to analyze the consequences of employing a time-scaling operation \\( g(t) = f(\\\\alpha t) \\) where \\( \\\\alpha \\) is a scaling factor.\n\nGiven the transformed result \\(L(g)(s)\\) of \\(g(t) = h(\\\\alpha t)\\) where \\(h(t) = f(t) + k(t)\\), can we clearly identify both the scaling factor \\(\\\\alpha\\) and the form of \\(k(t)\\) just from the transformation output?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\(L(g)(s)\\) provides a scaled composite view of \\(h(t)\\), which is a combination of \\(f(t)\\) and \\(k(t)\\). The overlap in the effects of scaling and addition makes it challenging to separately identify \\(\\\\alpha\\) and the specific form of \\(k(t)\\) without more information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
