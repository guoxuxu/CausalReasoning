  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. We analyze the system’s behavior when exposed to the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = De^{Nt}z \\\\), where D and N are constant matrices and D is diagonalizable.\n\nKnowing the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine which transformations were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), just from the final state and knowing the original dynamic equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of parameters for D, N, F, and Q can lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially since different matrices might not commute. The relationships between the transformations and the base dynamics introduce ambiguities that prevent uniquely identifying which transformations were applied just by looking at the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
