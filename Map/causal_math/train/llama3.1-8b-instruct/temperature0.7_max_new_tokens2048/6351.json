  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state of a system is described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Cx + Du \\\\), where C and D are constant matrices and u is a control input. Assume the control input is transformed according to \\\\( g(u) = K e^{Lt} u \\\\), where K and L are also constant matrices.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(u) = M e^{Nt} u \\\\) where M and N are constant matrices, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on matrices C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another control transformation \\\\( h(u) \\\\) further complicates the system dynamics. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T > t_1 will depend on the interaction of all matrices (C, D, K, L, M, N) throughout the timeline, altering the original trajectory and final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
