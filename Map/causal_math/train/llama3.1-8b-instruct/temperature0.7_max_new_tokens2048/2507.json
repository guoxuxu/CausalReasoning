  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We study the influence of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) of the system.\n\nIf an additional transformation by a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) is applied at intermediate time t1 to the system's state, will the final state of the system \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), for T > t1, be solely determined by the original Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a Laplace transform as an additional transformation during the evolution creates a new intermediate state that influences the final outcome. Consequently, the state of the system at time T is affected by both the initial Fourier and subsequent Laplace transforms, altering the behavior and distribution of u based on both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
