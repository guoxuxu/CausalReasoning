  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation in one dimension described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is the temperature distribution and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) is observed at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we accurately deduce the original distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\), it is impossible to determine if the observed distribution at time \\\\( T \\\\) resulted from an exponentially scaled initial condition or not, especially since the scaling factor \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\) could significantly alter the evolution path of the distribution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
