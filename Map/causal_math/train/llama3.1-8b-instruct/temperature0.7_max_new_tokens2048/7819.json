  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where D is a diffusion constant. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{-k^2 t} \\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform, on the temporal evolution of \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new intervention represented by an operator \\\\( S(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{-3k^2 t_1} \\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\) is applied, will the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on the properties or timing of either \\\\( T(u) \\\\) or \\\\( S(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( S(u) \\\\) introduces additional modifications at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), significantly affecting the diffusion process post-intervention. Both the timing and characteristics of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( S(u) \\\\) contribute to the system's evolution and final state, alongside the diffusion constant D.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
