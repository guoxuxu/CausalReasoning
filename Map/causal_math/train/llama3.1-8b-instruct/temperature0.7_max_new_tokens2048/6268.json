  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}u \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex constant vector. This function is acted upon by a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine the sequence of transformations (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( R(z) \\\\), neither, or both) used, based solely on knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially be identical from different sequences of transformations due to the properties of matrix multiplication in the complex field, specifically when dealing with exponential matrix functions. Different initializations and transformations may lead similarly to the same endpoint, causing ambiguity in inferring the exact path of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
