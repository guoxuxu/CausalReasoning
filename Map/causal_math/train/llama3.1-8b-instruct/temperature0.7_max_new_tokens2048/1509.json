  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Schrödinger equation \\\\(i \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H \\\\psi\\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is the Hamiltonian operator. We examine the effect of a unitary transformation \\\\(U(t) = e^{-i At}\\\\) on the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a Hermitian operator.\n\nIf \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is applied to a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the original Schrödinger equation without further intervention, will the state \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) under the original equation to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\(U(t)\\\\) affects the initial state \\\\(\\\\psi_0\\\\), altering its evolution path. Even though \\\\(U(t)\\\\) is unitary and preserves the norm, it changes the phase and the specific state characteristics due to the interaction between \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(H\\\\), resulting in a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
