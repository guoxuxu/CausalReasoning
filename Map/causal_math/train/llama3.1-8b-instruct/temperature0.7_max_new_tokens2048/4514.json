  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\(dz/dt = Mz\\\\), where M represents a square matrix. We explore the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) at some initial condition and examine its impact on system dynamics.\n\nAfter witnessing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without having the information about the application of the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform modifies initial conditions by decomposing them into frequency components. Without knowing whether this decomposition (or transformation) has taken place, recovering the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely from the observed state at t = T is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
