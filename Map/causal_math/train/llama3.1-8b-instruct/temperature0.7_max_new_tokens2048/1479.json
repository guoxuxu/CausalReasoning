  "Problem": "Consider a function $u(x, t)$ that satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) $\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu$, where $L$ is a linear differential operator. This scenario examines the effect of an integral transformation $T(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} u(x,t) \\\\, dt$, which corresponds to the Laplace transform with respect to time $t$.\n\nIf at some time $t_1$ an operator $K$ is applied where $Ku = u + v$, with $v(x, t)$ another function not necessarily satisfying $Lu = 0$, and this results in a new function $u'(x,t)$, will $T(u')$ satisfy a PDE among $T(u)$ and $K$?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with $K$ introduces $v(x, t)$ which does not necessarily conform to the original PDE. This discrepancy alters the nature of the resulting function such that the direct application of $L$ does not yield the original Laplace transformed PDE. Instead, additional terms or different operators might be required to describe $T(u')$ correctly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
