  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a differential operator. In this scenario, we explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(x) = L[x] \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator, applied at a specific time.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( h(x) = L[x] \\\\) at time t = 0 change the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) in such a way that the state at time T differs from just evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) for the same time period?",
  "Explanation": "Initial application of the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) modifies \\\\( x_0 \\\\), potentially changing the eigenvectors or eigenvalues involved, thus altering the trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) compared to that of the untransformed initial condition under the same operator \\\\( D \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
