  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate how transformations defined by the integral transformation \\\\(T[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{\\\\alpha s} f(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with constant \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), affect the function over time t.\n\nHaving observed the outcome of the transformed function \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T, can we precisely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation modifies the function in such a way that it integrates all prior influences of both the exponential term and the original function up to time t. This accumulation means the exact original state at any earlier time, specifically t = 0, cannot be confidently reverse-engineered solely from knowing \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T without additional information about \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
