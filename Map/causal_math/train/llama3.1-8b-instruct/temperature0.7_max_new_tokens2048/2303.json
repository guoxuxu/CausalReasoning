  "Problem": "Let's consider the vector space transformation by the integral transform \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), known as the Laplace Transform. We study the behavior when the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, transforms under this operation.\n\nIf an intervention by another matrix function \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied at some point, will the resulting transformation \\\\( T[f+g](s) \\\\) be dependent solely on the initial matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt}y \\\\) modifies the original function, and the final transformed function in the s-domain, \\\\( T[f+g](s) \\\\), will depend on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The results in the s-domain reflect contributions from both matrices, thus affecting the overall transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
