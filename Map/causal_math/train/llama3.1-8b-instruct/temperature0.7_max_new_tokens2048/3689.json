  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under the Fourier transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\xi t} dt\\\\).\n\nDoes applying the Fourier transform to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) directly preserve the frequency component \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) in the transformed domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) results in a Dirac delta function at \\\\(\\\\xi = \\\\omega\\\\). Hence, the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is preserved as the sole component in the frequency domain, reflecting a direct translation from time to frequency domain without alteration of the frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
