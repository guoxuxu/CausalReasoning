  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Mz(t) \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. Consider the transformation function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), wherein N is another complex matrix, and explore the system dynamics under various conditions.\n\nCan we precisely identify which transformations (be it \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were applied up to time T, merely by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlap in potential trajectories and the non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials, different combinations of applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) at various times could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Hence, the interventions cannot be uniquely identified just from the endpoint, due to the potential for equivalent states arising from different pathway combinations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
