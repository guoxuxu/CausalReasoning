  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are components of a vector function under the influence of a matrix transformation given by \\\\( A \\\\). An additional transformation, a rotation in the complex plane, is introduced as \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) represents the rotation angle.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally ascertain which rotations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from various combinations of rotations and transformations, with possible indistinguishable overlapping effects from \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\). This ambiguity, compounded by the matrix transformation A, precludes the precise identification of specifically which rotations were implemented.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
