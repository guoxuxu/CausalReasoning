  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of the integral transformation \\\\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\\\) on the function \\\\\\( f(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf we apply \\\\\\( T[f(t)] \\\\\\) to \\\\\\( f(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\), then let \\\\\\( T[f(t)] \\\\\\) naturally evolve without further manipulation, does the output \\\\\\( F(s) \\\\\\) remain purely as a function of \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) without any additional factors?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\\\( F(s) \\\\\\) after applying the transformation \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) is a Laplace transform of \\\\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\), which yields \\\\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{s^2 + \\\\omega^2} \\\\\\). This expression is derived purely from the properties of \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\), and no other factors will alter this result due to the linear nature of the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
