  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its effect on solutions to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} w = kw \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and other similar transformations, impact the behavior of solutions over the complex plane.\n\nCan we deduce the original value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane after observing \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at a different point without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The exponential transformation potentially changes \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to a degree that recovering the original value from the observed solution's endpoint, without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), becomes uncertain due to the many-to-one nature of the exponential function on the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
