  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod over time t is modeled by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of applying a time-dependent heat source \\( S(x,t) = h(t) \\cdot \\cos(\\omega x) \\) along the rod.\n\nIf at a certain time t = 5, an intervention modifies the heat equation to \\( u_t = k' u_{xx} \\) (where k' is a different thermal diffusivity), will the endpoint \\( u(x,T) \\) for T = 10 depend only on the original k and not on k' or \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the thermal diffusivity at t = 5, which alters the rate of heat diffusion. Thus, the endpoint \\( u(x,T) \\) at T = 10 will depend on both the original function \\( h(t) \\), the original thermal diffusivity k, and the modified diffusivity k', affecting the overall temperature distribution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
