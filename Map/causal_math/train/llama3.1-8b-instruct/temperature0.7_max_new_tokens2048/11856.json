  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct} z(t) dt \\\\) is explored, where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is computed for a vector \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under the defined differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under the differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) aggregates the entire trajectory influenced by C, summing across differentially influenced states due to \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\). This transformed trajectory integration produces a different outcome compared to mere evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) through \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
