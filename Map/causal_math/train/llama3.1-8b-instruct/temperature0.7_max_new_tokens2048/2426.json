  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( s(t) = L[f(t)] \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) describes the evolution of a signal over time. We're studying how the convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), represented as \\\\( h(t) = f(t) * g(t) \\\\), impacts the transformed system.\n\nAfter observing the transformed signal \\\\( s'(t) \\\\) at a later time, can we deduce the exact form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) knowing that a convolution occurred at the beginning?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying \\\\( g(t) \\\\) from \\\\( s'(t) \\\\) relies on deconvolution, which without additional constraints or information can lead to multiple feasible solutions, especially if the transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) share similar characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
