  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nFrom the observed Fourier transform of the resultant \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) after intervention with \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we decipher which specific intervention (whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or some other function) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The observable effect in the Fourier transform is the shift in frequency, which could result from any intervention causing a similar frequency modification. Without more details about how the phase or amplitude might uniquely change with specific interventions, it's not possible to identify precisely what intervention led to the observed frequency shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
