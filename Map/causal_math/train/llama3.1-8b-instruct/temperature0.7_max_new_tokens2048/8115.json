  "Problem": "Consider a complex function integral transformation defined by \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is an analytic function. We analyze how different transformations by \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) without and with interventions affect the transformed function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the function is changed from \\\\( f(t) = e^{2t} \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\) as an intervention, will the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\\\) for \\\\( s > 2 \\\\) depend only on the modified function and not on the initial function \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function form to \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\), and since the Laplace transformation pertains only to the transformed function at the time of application, the resulting transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\) depends only on \\\\( g(t) \\\\), irrespective of what \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was before.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
