  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra framework analyzing the effect of matrix diagonalization on eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The system examines the matrix transformation \\\\( P^{-1}AP \\\\), where A is an initial matrix and P is the matrix formed by the eigenvectors of A.\n\nIf matrix A is diagonally transformed into \\\\( D = P^{-1}AP \\\\) without any external modification, will the eigenvalues of D be the same as eigenvalues of A?",
  "Explanation": "The process of diagonalization \\\\( P^{-1}AP \\\\) changes the basis to the eigenvectors of A but does not alter the eigenvalues. This operation is an eigendecomposition which preserves the eigenvalues while potentially rearranging the eigenvectors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → P; P → D; D → eigenvalues of D; A → eigenvalues of A; eigenvalues of A → eigenvalues of D; P → eigenvalues of D"
