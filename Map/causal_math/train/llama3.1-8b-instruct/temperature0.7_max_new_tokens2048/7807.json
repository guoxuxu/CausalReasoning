  "Problem": "Consider a complex function transformation of a vector space, where we use the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined by the operation \\\\( L(z) = pz + q \\\\) for complex scalars \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\). We investigate how the transformation impacts the solutions of the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix, over time t.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a new linear transformation \\\\( G(z) = rz + s \\\\) (where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are complex constants) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 exclusively depend on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on the transformations \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G \\\\) further alters the pathway, impacting the ultimate state by integrating effects of \\\\( rz + s \\\\) into the evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\). Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on all three factors: \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( L \\\\) (from initial condition modification), and \\\\( G \\\\) (from the intervention).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
