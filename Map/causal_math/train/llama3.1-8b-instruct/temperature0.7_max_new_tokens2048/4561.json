  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by adding a phase shift of \\\\( i\\\\theta t \\\\). The subsequent evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) means the system's behavior will include the effects of both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\), leading to \\\\( z(T) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\theta)T} z_0 \\\\) rather than \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
