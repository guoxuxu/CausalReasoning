  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter and \\\\( i \\\\) the imaginary unit. This function represents the solution to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\). We examine the effect of applying a linear operator, represented by matrix A, to alter the function: \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention with another operator B (where \\\\( g(z) = Bz \\\\)) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on A or B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the function at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), resulting in \\\\( z(t_1) = B(e^{i\\\\omega t_1}Az_0) \\\\). The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega (T-t_1)}z(t_1) \\\\), clearly depending on both A and B, as they shape the function's evolution post-intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
