  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical setting where the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t)dt\\\\), is used to solve differential equations. We consider the scenario where we apply this transformation to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p\\\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0\\\\) under different initial conditions and interventions.\n\nGiven the transformed function in the Laplace domain, can we uniquely determine the initial conditions \\\\(y(0)\\\\) and \\\\(y'(0)\\\\) without knowing p and q?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of the knowledge of parameters p and q, the transformed function in the Laplace domain does not uniquely specify the initial conditions because multiple differential equations (with different p and q values) can result in function forms that match in the Laplace domain, thus not allowing a unique determination of \\\\(y(0)\\\\) and \\\\(y'(0)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "y(0) → Laplace transform; y'(0) → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → p; Laplace transform → q; Laplace transform → y(0); Laplace transform → y'(0); p → Laplace transform; q → Laplace transform; initial conditions → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → solution"
