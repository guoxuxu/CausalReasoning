  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) on a vector space equipped with a linear operator \\\\( L(v) \\\\). The transformation alters vector \\\\( v \\\\) over time via \\\\( v(t) = e^{Mt}v_0 \\\\). The operator's behavior on transformed vectors is given by \\\\( L(v(t)) = e^{Nt}L(v_0) \\\\) where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the specific interventions used (\\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( K \\\\), or both) be deduced solely from observing \\\\( L(v(T)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( L(v(T)) \\\\) results from compounded transformations and their interaction with \\\\( N \\\\). Due to the non-commutativity potential of these matrices and the compounded transformations, it's impossible to pinpoint which interventions were definitively utilized.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
