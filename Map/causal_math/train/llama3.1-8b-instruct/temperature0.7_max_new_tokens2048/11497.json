  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where an input signal \\( x(t) \\) is passed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution with an impulse response \\( h(t) \\). The transformed signal \\( y(t) \\) is then subjected to a Fourier transform, generating \\( Y(\\omega) \\).\n\nDoes the resultant frequency domain representation \\( Y(\\omega) \\) depend solely on the input signal \\( x(t) \\) without considering the impulse response \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\( Y(\\omega) \\) depends on both the input signal \\( x(t) \\) and the system's impulse response \\( h(t) \\) due to convolution; thus it is not solely based on \\( x(t) \\). The Fourier transform of the output \\( y(t) = x(t) * h(t) \\) results in \\( Y(\\omega) = X(\\omega)H(\\omega) \\), showing dependency on both \\( X(\\omega) \\) and \\( H(\\omega) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
