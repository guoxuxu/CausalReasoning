  "Problem": "Analyze a system represented by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. The response of the system to inputs is investigated under the influence of a complex function transformation \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\), with K being another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further intervention, will the result \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to what would be obtained if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) had not undergone transformation and was simply evolved under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the initial state via the exponential matrix \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\), which potentially modifies the eigenstructure of the initial vector relative to D. This results in a trajectory that diverges from that of the untransformed system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "K → h(x); h(x) → x(t); D → \\dot{x}; x(t) → x(t) if no transformation; x(t) → x(t) if with transformation"
