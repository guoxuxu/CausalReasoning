  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. We explore the role of the Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) which transforms this function into the s-domain, affecting the evolution of z.\n\nWith the time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) observed at \\\\( t = T \\\\), and no information regarding an initial Laplace transform, can we certainly infer initial conditions or reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) and the differential equation governing it allows reconstruction of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) by reversing the applicable differential equation — assuming no transformation or information loss occurred. This is independent of whether an initial Laplace transform was applied, provided it has been inversely transformed back fully if applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
