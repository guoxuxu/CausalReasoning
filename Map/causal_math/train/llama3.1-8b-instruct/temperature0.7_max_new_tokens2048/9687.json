  "Problem": "Consider a series of random variables \\\\( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \\\\), each formed by the linear transformation \\\\( Y_i = AX_i \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on these variables and explore the causal inference across these transformations.\n\nIf an additional transformation, say \\\\( Z_i = B(X_i + Y_i) \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is another constant matrix), is introduced after applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( X_i \\\\), will the resulting \\\\( Z_i \\\\)'s characteristics be dependent solely on the operations described without considering the original properties of \\\\( X_i \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant variable \\\\( Z_i \\\\) incorporates components both from the original \\\\( X_i \\\\) and transformed \\\\( Y_i \\\\), thus retaining dependencies not only on the transformations applied (A and Fourier transform) but also intrinsically on the properties of \\\\( X_i \\\\). The interaction between these transformations and the original characteristics of \\\\( X_i \\\\) influences the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
