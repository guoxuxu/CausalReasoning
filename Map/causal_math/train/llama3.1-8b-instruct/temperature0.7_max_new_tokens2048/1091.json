  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution over a rod is modeled by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) with a thermal diffusivity constant k. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied as a functional alteration, impacting the system's response to thermal inputs.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new intervention by a Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) is applied, will the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be solely dependent on the heat equation's thermal diffusivity constant k and not on the effects of the Fourier or Laplace Transforms?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the Laplace Transform as an intervention changes the conditions under which the system evolves. It alters not just the state at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) but potentially introduces a new dynamic in the transform space, thus making the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) dependent on the initial Fourier Transform, the intervention by the Laplace Transform, and the thermal diffusivity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
