  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}x\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex square matrix, and \\\\(x\\\\) is a complex initial vector. We explore transformations with the operation \\\\(f(z) = Cz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is observed over time, and the consequences of an intervention through function \\\\(f\\\\) are analyzed.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z) = Cz\\\\) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) and the system evolves onwards, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) be governed only by the matrix \\\\(A\\\\), irrespective of the application of \\\\(C\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention consisting of applying \\\\(f(z) = Cz\\\\) fundamentally changes the state of the system at \\\\(t_1\\\\), modifying the trajectory based on how \\\\(C\\\\) interacts with \\\\(A\\\\). As such, the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will reflect the combined influence of both matrices, \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), due to the transformation applied at \\\\(t_1\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
