  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\( z(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\\\) under a transformation \\\\( T(r, s) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-i\\\\theta} z(r\\\\cos(\\\\theta), s\\\\sin(\\\\theta)) d\\\\theta \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the output after applying both \\\\( U(q, p) \\\\) and \\\\( T(r, s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the sequence and specifics of both transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final output, discerning the individual impact and sequence of the transformations \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) is intricate due to their potential overlapping effects on the function, and the integral averaging obscures distinct characteristics attributable to \\\\( U \\\\) alone. Therefore, the transformations cannot be uniquely identified from the final output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
