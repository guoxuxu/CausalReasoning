  "Problem": "Consider the space of complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant. Suppose we apply an integral transformation represented by \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) is applied to a function \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) at any future time \\\\(T\\\\) represent the same transform as if \\\\(z_0(t)\\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\(T\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{z}(s)\\\\) is a linear and time-invariant operator due to its integral nature over exponentials. Hence, the initial transformation and subsequent evolution governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) will yield the same result irrespective of the initial condition or the progression of time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
