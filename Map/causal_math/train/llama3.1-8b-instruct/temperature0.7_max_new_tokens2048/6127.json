  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) describes the time evolution of a complex vector \\\\( w \\\\) under a complex transformation, where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. The effect of an integral transformation characterized by the operator \\\\( T(t) \\\\) which modifies the vector by \\\\( T(t)w = w + itAw \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(t) \\\\) is applied halfway through the evolution period, at \\\\( t_1 = T/2 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on the original transformation \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) without any influence from \\\\( T(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(t_1) = T(T/2) \\\\) modifies the trajectory by altering the vector to \\\\( w + iTAw/2 \\\\). This change in initial conditions at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) subsequently influences the evolution under \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\), meaning the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is indeed affected by both \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) and \\\\( T(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
