  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a Laplace transform where the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = Ky \\\\) governs the evolution of the function y(t). We apply a transformation \\\\( f(y) = L^{-1}(P(s) L(y(s))) \\\\), where P(s) is a polynomial in s and L denotes the Laplace transform.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\), can we specifically determine which transformations (whether \\\\( f(y) \\\\), \\\\( h(y) \\\\), or both) were applied, merely by knowing the value of \\\\( y(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( y(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of the transformations driven by different polynomial effects and their convolutions. Without the explicit forms of P(s) and Q(s), and due to possible equivalences in the resultant modifications from varying compositions, it's infeasible to uniquely isolate which transformations were applied based solely on the output at \\\\( y(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
