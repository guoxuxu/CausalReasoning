  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) and A is a matrix. We analyze the causal effect of a matrix intervention \\\\( B \\\\) on function \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+B)t} \\\\) and its corresponding transformed function over time.\n\nIf the matrix A is changed to \\\\( A + B \\\\) without further interventions, will the transformed function \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+B)t} \\\\) be the same as if only transformed with original matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "Changing A to \\\\( A + B \\\\) alters the original function, leading to \\\\( f(t) = e^{(A+B)t} \\\\). The transformation under \\\\( T[f](s) \\\\) will yield a different result, since the Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{(A+B)t} \\\\) involves the resolvent of \\\\( sI - (A+B) \\\\), which differs fundamentally from \\\\( sI - A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
