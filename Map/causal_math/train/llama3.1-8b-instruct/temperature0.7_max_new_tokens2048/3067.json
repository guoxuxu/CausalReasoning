  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant matrix. Let us examine the impact of an integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt}z \\, dt \\), where \\( D \\) is another constant matrix, over the time interval [0, t].\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a different matrix transformation \\( h(z) = e^{Et}z \\) (where \\( E \\) is a constant matrix) is introduced as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend on \\( C \\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( h(z) \\) adds another layer of complexity, potentially altering the trajectory in a way dependent on the interaction of \\( C \\), \\( D \\), and \\( E \\). The final state \\( z(T) \\) is thus influenced by all these factors, not just \\( C \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
