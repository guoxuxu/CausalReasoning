  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the impact of the linear transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing transformations were applied, can we determine the specific transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) used on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) purely based on the endpoint at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ambiguity in how \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) affect the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) means multiple combinations of \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) could result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, knowing only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the transformations applied during the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
