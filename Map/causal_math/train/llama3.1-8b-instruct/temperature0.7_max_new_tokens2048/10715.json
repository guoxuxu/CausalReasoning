  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, and \\( z \\) is subjected to the integral transformation \\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\), with complex variable \\( s \\). Analyze the effects of modifying \\( u(t) \\) or \\( v(t) \\) separately on \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nIf at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention modifies \\( v(t) \\) by adding a constant value, will this intervention have an effect on the real part of \\( Z(s) \\) at any \\( s \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention on \\( v(t) \\) alters only the imaginary part of \\( z(t) \\) and consequently affects only the imaginary part of \\( Z(s) \\). The real part of \\( Z(s) \\), dependent solely on \\( u(t) \\), remains unaffected by changes in \\( v(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
