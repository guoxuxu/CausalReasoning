  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( z'(t) = iz(t) \\\\). This differential equation describes a rotation in the complex plane. The function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), where k is a real constant, is analyzed over time t.\n\nCan we precisely deduce the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the multiplication by \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\) at t = 0 obscures the original magnitude and phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Without knowing whether this scaling was applied, we can't recover \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
