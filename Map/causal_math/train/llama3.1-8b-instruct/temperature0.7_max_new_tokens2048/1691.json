  "Problem": "Examine the effect of a Fourier transformation denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined on the real line. Further, let's consider that \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is initially described by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = -\\lambda g(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive real number. The Fourier transform is then impacted by an additional transformation \\\\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\\\), where \\\\( f \\\\) represents frequency and \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an additional intervention transformation \\\\( h(f) \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting profile \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\) for T > t_1 remain dependent only on the characteristics of \\\\( h(f) \\\\) and not on the intrinsic properties defined by \\\\( \\lambda \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final profile of \\\\( |\\\\mathcal{F}[g](f, T)| \\\\) will depend both on the intrinsic decay parameter \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) as it influences the overall decay aspect across the time domain, and on \\\\( h(f) \\\\), which modifies the frequency response. Thus, the outcome reflects a combination of both effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
