  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\). The system's evolution is examined under the impact of this transformation over time t.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( N \\\\) (another matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both interventions \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), besides the angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), influence the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\). The transformations can change both magnitude and phase, affecting the trajectory even if they occur at different times.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
