  "Problem": "Consider a real-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} F(t, s) g(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( F(t, s) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( g(s) \\\\) is an initial function. This scenario examines the effects of various manipulations on the function \\\\( g(s) \\\\) in terms of how it impacts \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf we replace \\\\( g(s) \\\\) with another function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) from the start, without any other interference, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be directly affected by this change?",
  "Explanation": "Replacing \\\\( g(s) \\\\) with \\\\( h(s) \\\\) changes the integral input, directly affecting the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the direct dependence of the integral outcome on the function being integrated. The transformation will yield a different \\\\( z(t) \\\\) because it fundamentally changes the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
