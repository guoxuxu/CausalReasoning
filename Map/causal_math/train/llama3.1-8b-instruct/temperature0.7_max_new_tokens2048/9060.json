  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\( z(t) = C \\\\int_0^t \\\\exp(A(s-t))B u(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where A, B, and C are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( w(t) = Dz(t) \\\\) where D is a transformation matrix.\n\nWith known \\\\( w(T) \\\\) and transformations \\\\( D \\\\) applied, can we uniquely determine the control inputs (\\\\( u(t) \\\\) or \\\\( v(t) \\\\)) used at any point prior to \\\\( T \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact control inputs \\\\( u(t) \\\\) or \\\\( v(t) \\\\) from \\\\( w(T) \\\\) is not feasible without extra data like exact time of intervention or system parameters (A, B, C), since the outputs could result from various combinations of control actions and system dynamics, and the matrix D could obscure the effects of these controls.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
