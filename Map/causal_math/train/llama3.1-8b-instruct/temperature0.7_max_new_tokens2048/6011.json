  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 z = 0 \\\\) in a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with boundary conditions modified by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) on the boundary \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). Analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) to solve for the internal values of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf a control function \\\\( k(x, y) \\\\) is applied to the boundary \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\) as an intervention during the computation of \\\\( z \\\\), will the solution inside \\\\( D \\\\) remain unaffected by the initial conditions set by \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(x, y) \\\\) alters the boundary conditions during the solution process. This introduces new dynamics to the system's boundary, influencing the internal solution \\\\( z \\\\) as dictated by the Laplace equation. This effect is compounded by how \\\\( k(x, y) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) interact on the boundary, leading to a potentially different solution inside \\\\( D \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
