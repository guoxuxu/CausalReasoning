  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The scenario evaluates the impact of modifying this function through an integral transform, specifically a Laplace transform, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) valid for \\\\( \\\\Re(s) > 0 \\\\).\n\nBased on the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform results in a function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), where the pole at \\\\( s = i\\\\omega \\\\) directly reveals the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from the imaginary part of the pole, therefore allowing for exact determination of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
