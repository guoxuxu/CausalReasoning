  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t)dt \\\\. Analyze the causal impact on the transformed function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) given an intervention \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) with an additional function \\\\( g(t) = e^t \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) after the function \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) was modified by \\\\( g(t) = e^t \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we determine if the modification by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) occurred based solely on \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) after intervention by \\\\( g(t) = e^t \\\\) may resemble that of unmodified or differently modified forms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), especially since both \\\\( t^2 \\\\) and \\\\( e^t \\\\) contribute significantly to \\\\( H(s) \\\\). This overlap in potential effects makes it impossible to concretely determine whether and how \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
