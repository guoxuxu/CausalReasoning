  "Problem": "Consider the evaluation of the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\\\cos(tx) \\\\, dx \\\\) changing the variable x through the transformation \\\\( u = ax + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants and analyzing the impact on the function's behaviour.\n\nIf \\\\( u = ax + b \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( x \\\\) to \\\\( u \\\\) upfront and then the integral \\\\( I \\\\) is computed, does the result change from the standard Gauss integral without such variable shift?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the variable will not only shift but also scale the values of \\\\( x \\\\) contributing in the integral. The constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) affect the limits and the integrand itself leading to a potential difference in the outcome especially due to the \\\\( cos(tx) \\\\) term which becomes \\\\( cos(t(ax+b)/a) \\\\), thus affecting the resultant integral's value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
