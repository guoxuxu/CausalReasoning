  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We explore the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\\\\\((\\\\mathcal{L})\\\\) on this function with respect to its coefficients \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), creating a transformed function \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{\\\\alpha u(t) + \\\\beta v(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at a later time, can you uniquely determine any prior changes made to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) without additional information about the initial conditions of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial forms or conditions of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\), determining how \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) were altered from only the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is not feasible. The transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is affected by the integrated behavior of the functions, which depends on both the coefficients and the functions' initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
