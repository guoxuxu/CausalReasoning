  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the function \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{At}s \\, ds \\\\), where A is a complex number. To analyze the behavior, an intervention by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is also a complex number, is considered over time t.\n\nKnowing that an endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) has been reached, can we determine exactly which constants (A or B) were involved, assuming an intervention was deployed?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), multiple combinations of A and B (or even different functions g) could produce the same outcome. The nonlinear interaction between the constants under the transformation makes it impossible to uniquely identify which were used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
