  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this function.\n\nGiven the final state of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) at some \\\\( s \\\\), can we determine what interventions (such as \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\)) occurred, based solely on knowing \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different interventions could lead to similar or identical transformations in the Laplace domain, making it impossible to deduce the specific nature or sequence of interventions applied merely from the final state of \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
