  "Problem": "Suppose we analyze the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}x + \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}Bu(s) \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. This system reflects the solution to a linear time-invariant dynamic system with input.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\) such that \\\\( u(t) \\\\) changes course, will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the total history of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from 0 to T, including both before and after the intervention at \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The integral term accumulates effects of \\\\( u(s) \\\\) over the entire interval [0, T], making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a cumulative outcome of all control inputs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
