  "Problem": "Consider a signal transformation system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\). We investigate the effect of multiplying the original signal by an exponential function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at}g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is the original signal and \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nIf we apply the exponential modification \\\\( f(t) = e^{at}g(t) \\\\) to a signal and then compute its Laplace Transform, will the domain of convergence for \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be shifted by \\\\( a \\\\) compared to \\\\( G(s) \\\\), the Laplace Transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying the signal by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) before taking the Laplace Transform shifts the domain of convergence of the transform by \\\\( a \\\\) units to the left. This is due to the exponential factor's impact on the growth rate of the signal, effectively altering the convergence behavior of the integral defining \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
