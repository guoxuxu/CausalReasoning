  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a user-controlled input and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a fixed angular frequency. The evolution of the system is studied through the application of the Laplace Transform, transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is adjusted at a particular instant \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to a different function \\\\( v(t) \\\\), will the future state of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at any time t > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the new function \\\\( v(t) \\\\) under the Laplace Transform?",
  "Explanation": "The alteration of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) to \\\\( v(t) \\\\) will influence the future states of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\); however, these states are also influenced by the ongoing effect of the exponential term \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), showing that the outcome depends on both the new function and the inherent system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
