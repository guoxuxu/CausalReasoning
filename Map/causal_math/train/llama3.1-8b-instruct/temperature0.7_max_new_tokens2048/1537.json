  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, evolved under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) with \\\\( P \\\\) being a constant matrix. We also incorporate the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix, to observe changes over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then this state is evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved directly under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming the initial condition with \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) modifies the initial state by multiplying it with the matrix exponential, which does not generally commute with P. This alteration leads to a different trajectory of the system, hence, a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
