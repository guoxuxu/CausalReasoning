  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex system modeled by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. The transformation considered is \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing only the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and that some interventions occurred, can we precisely assert whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), both, or neither were used during the evolution of the system?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of parameters for \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) and different timings for their application could result in the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The complexity introduced by overlapping exponential effects on both magnitude and phase makes it challenging to deduce the specific interventions and their parameters solely based on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
