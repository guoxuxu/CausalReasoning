  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x and y are functions of time, t, subject to a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) with constant matrices A and B. The function z evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( U(z) = Dz + E \\\\) is applied as an intervention, where D and E are constant matrices, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the matrices A, B, and C?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( U(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) further alters the state to a new value modified by D and E, and the resulting state evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) also depends on the initial application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\). Therefore, the final state at T depends on A, B, C, and the subsequent intervention parameters D and E.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
