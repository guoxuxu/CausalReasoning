  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with complex function mappings characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of the transformation described by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is another constant matrix affecting complex functionalities.\n\nFrom observing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we specify exactly which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both) by only inspecting the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect witnessed at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be the result of various transformations, combinations, and sequences of applying \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Et} \\\\). Due to the complex nature of exponential matrix effects in the differential equations and potential non-commutativity, the end state does not uniquely specify which transformations were enacted throughout the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
