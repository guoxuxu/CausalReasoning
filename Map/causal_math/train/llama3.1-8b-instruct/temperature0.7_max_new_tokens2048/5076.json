  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + Bze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where A and B are constants, and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. We examine the behavior of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = z e^{Ct} \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining exactly which interventions were used based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible because of the potential for different combinations of transformations and interventions (\\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\)) to produce equivalent endpoints. This creates ambiguity and prevents definitive back-tracking of the transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
