  "Problem": "Consider the functional equation \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}B u(s) \\\\, ds\\\\) describing a control system where A and B are constant matrices, and u(t) is a control function. Explore the impacts of applying a linear operator transformation \\\\(T(z) = Cz(t)\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on this system.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\(S(z) = Dz(t)\\\\) is applied as an intervention at time t1 before reaching time T, does the final state z(T) depend only on the properties of B and not on A, C, or D?",
  "Explanation": "The final state z(T) is influenced by all transformations and the matrix B controlling the input. The application of S(z) introduces additional dynamics, and the matrices C and D, along with A in the system's functional equation, influence how the control input shapes the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
