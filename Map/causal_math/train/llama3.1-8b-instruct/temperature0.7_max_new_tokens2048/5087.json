  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx + Mu\\\\), where L and M are constant matrices and u represents control input. Let's explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}x dt\\\\), where Q is a constant matrix, on the system.\n\nIf an additional control input \\\\(u\\\\) is modified at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) to be \\\\(v = u + Nt\\\\) (where N is a constant matrix) and this input is used until time t, will the system's state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) depend solely on L and M, irrespective of Q?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of the control input introduces another layer of complexity that, along with the effect of the initial transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\), influences the final state. The system's output at time t becomes a function of L, M, N, and Q due to the compounded effect of the control change and the transformation integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
