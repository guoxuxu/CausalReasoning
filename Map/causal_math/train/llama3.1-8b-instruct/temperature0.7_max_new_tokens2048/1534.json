  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) and its influence on a real function defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-st}F(t) dt \\\\) where s is a complex variable. We analyze how transformations and interventions using a separate complex function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) affect the output of g(x).\n\nGiven the output function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), can we determine whether the initial input was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\) without knowing if \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\) could potentially map to similar outputs depending on the contours of integration and singularities handled, it's impractical to deduce the original input form without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
