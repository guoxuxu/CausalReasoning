  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We evaluate the effect of transformation by another function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) on the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nCan we infer the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = \\\\pi \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the phase or magnitude change induced by \\\\( z^2 \\\\) would make it impossible to confidently backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Observing \\\\( z(\\\\pi) \\\\) without this knowledge could correspond to multiple initial conditions depending on whether or not a transformation was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
