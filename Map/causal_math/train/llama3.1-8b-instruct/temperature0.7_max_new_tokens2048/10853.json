  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the integration transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'} z(t') \\\\, dt' \\\\) with constant matrix C over time t, and how this affects system behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\) through integration modifies the original trajectory by interacting with the system through matrix C and the integral of initial conditions, leading to potential deviations in both real and imaginary components at any time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
