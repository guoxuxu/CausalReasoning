  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of applying a Laplace transform, which transforms the function into \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), on the behavior of the system over time.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we infer the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "The structure of the Laplace transform output \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) explicitly includes the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as part of its expression. This direct representation allows for unambiguous deduction of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
