  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), representing a rotation in the complex plane, with A being a real constant. We explore how the function \\\\(f(z) = e^{iBt}z\\\\), where B is another real constant, affects this system over time t.\n\nGiven the observed complex number \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at time T, can we unambiguously deduce the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the application of \\\\(f(z) = e^{iBt}z\\\\) alters the initial conditions and the subsequent evolution path of the complex number, we cannot uniquely determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing the existence and effect of \\\\(f(z)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
