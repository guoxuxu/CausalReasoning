  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. To analyze the behavior, we intervene by applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}\\\\cdot z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a constant, at a certain time.\n\nIf a secondary transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\phi}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention at any time \\\\( t_2 \\\\) > 0, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_2, depend solely on the original system dynamics and not on \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the second transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention further shifts the phase of the system. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as well as the phase alterations introduced by \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), thus not solely depending on the original dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
