  "Problem": "Consider the scenario where we study the effect of a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{z^2}\\\\) on the contour integral \\\\(\\\\oint_C \\\\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\\\), where C is a closed contour around a point \\\\(a\\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf initially we apply \\\\(f(z)\\\\) to each point \\\\(z\\\\) on contour C, and then compute the integral of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) around C, will this integral be the same as the integral of 1/(z-a) around C without applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the integrand significantly, transforming it from \\\\(1/(z-a)\\\\) to \\\\(e^{z^2}/(z-a)\\\\). This change alters values across the contour path, potentially affecting the result of the integral depending on the location of \\\\(a\\\\) and the nature of C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
