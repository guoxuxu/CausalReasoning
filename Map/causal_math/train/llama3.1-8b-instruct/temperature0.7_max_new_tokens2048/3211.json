  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. A transformation involving a complex function \\\\(f(z) = Re(z^2)\\\\), where \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), is applied, influencing the boundary conditions of the domain.\n\nIf an intervention is made at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) where the boundary conditions are modified by another complex function \\\\(g(z) = Im(z^3)\\\\), will the final potential \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) be solely dependent on the initial boundaries set by \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a new influence on the potential via the function \\\\(g(z)\\\\), significantly impacting how \\\\(u(x, y, T)\\\\) evolves. Both \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\) shape the final state, making it dependent on the sequence of these modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
