  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves in time under the influence of a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + az \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We scrutinize the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is another complex constant, and observe the causal relationships and system dynamics.\n\nObserving the function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we identify if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was initially applied without knowing the value of \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the initial usage of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) solely based on observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible unless we know \\\\( b \\\\) since both \\\\( e^{at}z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( e^{(a+b)t}z_0 \\\\) can yield similar forms without clear differentiation if the contribution of \\\\( b \\\\) is unknown.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
