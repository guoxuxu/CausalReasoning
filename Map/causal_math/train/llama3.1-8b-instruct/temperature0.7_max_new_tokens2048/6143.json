  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is a nonlinear function, representing a closed system. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t{e^{At}F(z) dt} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention characterized by a transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T{e^{B(t-T)}F(z) dt} \\\\) is applied, will the eventual state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and not on the transformations related to \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) and is dependent on the specific forms of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) due to their roles in the respective exponential transformations. Consequently, the effect of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and the transformations combine non-trivially, affecting the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
