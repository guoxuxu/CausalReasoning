  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time t according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex number. We analyze the effect of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a modification \\\\( K(z) = \\\\int e^{Pt}z dt \\\\) (where P is another constant complex number) is applied at some time t = t_1, will the resulting state at t = T only depend on C and not on S or P?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( K(z) \\\\) at t_1 impacts the trajectory of the function, incorporating effects from P as well as from the initial application of S. The overall state at t = T thus depends on the entire dynamics introduced by C, S, and P through their combined transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
