  "Problem": "Consider a series of Fourier transformations applied to a function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which represents a probability density on the real line. Analyze the causal impact of convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian) on the original function.\n\nIf after initial convolution with \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\), another convolution with a different Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma') \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final Fourier transform \\\\( F(p_{new}(x)) \\\\) be independent of the initial \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Each convolution with a Gaussian kernel modifies the frequency domain representation of the function. The subsequent kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma') \\\\) does not negate the effects of the first \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\), but rather interacts cumulatively, making the final output dependent on both \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\sigma' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
