  "Problem": "Analyze a transfer function H(s) in the Laplace transform domain. Consider a linear system characterized by H(s) = 1/(s^2 + as + b), where a and b are constants. Let's study the impact of applying a unit step input U(s) = 1/s, and how it influences the system response.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the transfer function to H'(s) = 1/(s^2 + cs + d) (where c and d are new constants) at a certain time t1, will the endpoint Y(T) for T > t1 depend only on the original constants a and b?",
  "Explanation": "The new system dynamics defined by H'(s) takes over after the intervention, which means the future response depends on c and d. The original system characteristics defined by a and b will affect the response only up until t1.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
