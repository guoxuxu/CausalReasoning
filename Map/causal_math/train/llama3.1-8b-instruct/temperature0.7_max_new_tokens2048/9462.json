  "Problem": "Consider the complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit. The effect of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) is analyzed over time interval [0, T].\n\nAfter observing the result of the integral transformation at time T, is it possible to reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any further information?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the integral transformation combines all values of the original function in a specific way, resulting in a loss of information about individual points \\\\( z(t) \\\\) except at certain critical points. Recovery of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the integral alone generally requires additional conditions or information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
