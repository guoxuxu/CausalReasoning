  "Problem": "Combining a Fourier transform with complex functions, consider a signal \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and its Fourier transform given by \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} s(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\). Let the effect of an operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( s(t) \\\\) be defined as a multiplication by a fixed complex exponential, i.e., \\\\( L[s(t)] = e^{\\\\alpha t} s(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nDoes applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( s(t) \\\\) and then computing the Fourier transform result in a shift in the frequency domain compared to the original \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) shifts the Fourier spectrum of \\\\( s(t) \\\\) by \\\\( -\\\\alpha \\\\) in the frequency domain due to the properties of the Fourier transform of exponential functions. This results in the transform \\\\( \\\\hat{s}(\\\\omega - \\\\alpha) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "operator L → complex exponential; s(t) → s(t); s(t) → Fourier transform; complex exponential → frequency shift; frequency shift → Fourier transform; operator L → multiplication by complex exponential; operator L → s(t) with complex exponential; s(t) with complex exponential → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → frequency domain"
