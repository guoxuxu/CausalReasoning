  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + p(x) \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is a position-dependent velocity field. We analyze the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to the function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a specific time.\n\nFrom the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) at any later time \\\\( t \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x, t_0) \\\\) at \\\\( t_0 \\\\) without knowing how the system evolved, i.e., without knowing the function \\\\( p(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the exact original function \\\\( u(x, t_0) \\\\) solely from its Fourier transform at a later time requires precise knowledge of the velocity field \\\\( p(x) \\\\), since \\\\( p(x) \\\\) significantly influences the evolution and distribution of energy among the Fourier modes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
