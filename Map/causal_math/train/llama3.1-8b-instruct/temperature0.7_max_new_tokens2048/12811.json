  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) of a particle is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -kx \\\\), typically representing a harmonic oscillator. We study the effect of a Fourier transform applied to the initial velocity condition \\\\( v_0 \\\\) and its impact over time.\n\nGiven the displacement \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at the endpoint, can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (Fourier, Laplace, or both), based solely on the displacement observed?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the possibility of similar spectral modifications resulting from different transformations, the endpoint displacement \\\\( x(T) \\\\) might not clearly indicate which specific transformations (Fourier, Laplace, or both) were used. The transformations can conceal each other's specific effects, making it difficult to identify them solely from the resulting displacement.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → displacement x(T); x(T) → displacement observed; initial velocity v0 → Fourier transform → Laplace transform → displacement x(T); displacement observed → initial velocity v0; initial velocity v0 → displacement x(T)"
