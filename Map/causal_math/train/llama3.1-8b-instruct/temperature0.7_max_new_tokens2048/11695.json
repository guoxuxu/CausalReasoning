  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in linear algebra, for a matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and a vector \\\\( v \\\\) such that \\\\( Av = \\\\lambda v \\\\). We explore the scenario where a transformation \\\\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( P \\\\) is an invertible matrix representing a change of basis.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) is introduced and \\\\( v_0 \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( Qv_0 \\\\) as an intervention, will the characteristics of \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) still relate only to \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( P \\\\) or \\\\( Q \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) as an intervention can substantially alter the vector's relationship to \\\\( A \\\\)'s eigenproperties. The resultant vector at \\\\( T \\\\) may or may not behave as an eigenvector of \\\\( A \\\\), depending on how \\\\( Q \\\\) interacts with the eigenspace of \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
