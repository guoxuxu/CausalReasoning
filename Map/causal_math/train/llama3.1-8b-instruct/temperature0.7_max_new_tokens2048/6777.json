  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) applied to a linear system characterized by \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where \\( D \\) is a constant matrix and \\( \\omega \\) is a real number. The system's evolution is influenced by the Fourier transform, denoted as \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\), which transforms \\( x(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\( z(t) \\) is applied to the initial state vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then \\( x(t) \\) evolves under \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) with \\( z(t) \\) being the only transformation applied, will the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\) at time T represent the same frequency components as the untransformed system evolved to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) modifies the frequency content of \\( x(t) \\), adding a component at the frequency \\( \\omega \\). Even though the system evolves according to \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), the initial multiplication by \\( z(t) \\) introduces a new frequency component, which will be evident in \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\), differing from that of the original system's natural frequencies determined by \\( D \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
