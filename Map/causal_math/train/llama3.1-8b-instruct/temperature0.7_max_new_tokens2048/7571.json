  "Problem": "Consider a set of functions defined by complex mappings \\\\( z = f(w) = e^{iw} \\\\) where w is a complex number and i is the imaginary unit. The system evolves under the transformation \\\\( z(t) = f(w(t)) \\\\), with \\\\( w(t) = g + ht \\\\) where g and h are complex constants.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( f'(w) = e^{-iw} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, be solely dependent on the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the transformation \\\\( f'(w) = e^{-iw} \\\\) fundamentally alters the evolution path by applying the inverse exponential function, effectively undoing or altering the previous exponential mapping's effects. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus depends on both transformations applied throughout the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
