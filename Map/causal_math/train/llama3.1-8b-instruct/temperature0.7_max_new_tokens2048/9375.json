  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation of a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable and the integral transformation is the Laplace Transform. We study the effect of a linear differential operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}g = \\\\frac{d^2g}{dt^2} - 2\\\\frac{dg}{dt} + g \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time a new operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M}g = g + t\\\\frac{dg}{dt} \\\\) is applied as an intervention to a function already transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), will the resulting Laplace Transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) depend solely on the characteristics of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and not \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\) introduces an additive and derivative component modifying the original function anew, hence the resulting Laplace Transform will incorporate changes due to both operators, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{M} \\\\), reflecting the compounded effects of both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
