  "Problem": "In a stochastic process, the change in a variable X is governed by the differential equation \\\\( dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is the drift coefficient, \\\\( \\sigma \\\\) is the volatility coefficient, and \\\\( dW_t \\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We study how the application of a transformation \\\\( h(X) = X^2 \\\\) impacts the process over time.\n\nIf during the process, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( k(X) = \\sqrt{X} \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the stochastic parameters \\\\( \\mu \\\\) and \\\\( \\sigma \\\\), not on the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with both \\\\( h(X) \\\\) and \\\\( k(X) \\\\) drastically modify the trajectory of the system. Each transformation affects the scale and effective dynamics of the process in a nonlinear fashion, making the endpoint \\\\( X(T) \\\\) dependent on both the transformations and the original stochastic parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
