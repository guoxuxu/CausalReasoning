  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, \\(F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}\\) where \\(f(t)\\) is a time-domain representation and \\(F(s)\\) is its frequency-domain representation. The effect of an impulse response function \\(h(t)\\) on \\(f(t)\\), transformed as \\(H(s)\\), is analyzed through its impact on \\(F(s)\\).\n\nIf \\( h(t) \\) is altered to a different impulse response \\( j(t) \\) at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), and the transform \\( J(s) \\) is applied, will the resulting \\( G(s) = J(s)F(s) \\) solely depend on the new \\( J(s) \\) and not on the original \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new impulse response completely defines the transformation post \\( t_1 \\), as the convolution and subsequent transformation will now be with \\( j(t) \\), not \\( h(t) \\). Thus, the resulting frequency domain output only depends on \\( J(s) \\) and \\( F(s) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
