  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system governed by the matrix equation \\\\(\\\\dot{X} = MX + K\\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(K\\\\) are constant matrices. To analyze the system's behavior, a function \\\\(h(X) = e^{NX}\\\\) is considered, where \\\\(N\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. The function \\\\(h\\\\) can potentially be applied at initial or intermediate time points.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention via another transformation \\\\(l(X) = X + Q\\\\) (where \\\\(Q\\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied, will the system's state at a later time \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend solely on \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(K\\\\) and not on \\\\(N\\\\) and \\\\(Q\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces additional complexity into the system. The state \\\\(X(T)\\\\) is influenced by the initial transformation \\\\(e^{NX_0}\\\\), the matrix dynamics of \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(K\\\\), and the additional shift introduced by \\\\(Q\\\\). The system's state thereby depends on all matrices \\\\(N\\\\), \\\\(M\\\\), \\\\(K\\\\), and \\\\(Q\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
