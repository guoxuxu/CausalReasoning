  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), defined in a closed path in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are differentiable functions of t. The transformation operator \\\\( T \\\\) is defined as \\\\( Tz = z^2 \\\\), applied to the path of z.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to the complex path at t = 0 and then follows the same functional path without further modification, does the resultant path at t = T mimic the original path squared without considering \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the original path by squaring the complex function, hence altering the geometry and the nature of the path in the complex plane. The new path will follow the square of the original coordinates, which affects both magnitude and argument differently compared to the original.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
