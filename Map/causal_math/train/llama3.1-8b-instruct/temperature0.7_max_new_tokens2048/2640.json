  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, where the input function is \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and the output function is \\\\(y(t)\\\\) given by \\\\(y(t) = L[x(t)]\\\\) where L represents the Laplace transform operation. We analyze transformations by applying an exponential modifier \\\\(f(x) = e^{-\\sigma t}x(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(Y(s)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(f(x)\\\\), \\\\(g(x)\\\\), or both) just by knowing the transformed value \\\\(Y(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations by \\\\(e^{-\\sigma t}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{kt}\\\\) could result in several combinations of shifts or scaling in the Laplace domain, making the identification of exact interventions impractical without additional data. Multiple intervention combinations can yield similar or overlapping effects in the Laplace transformed output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
