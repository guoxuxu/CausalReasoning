  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we analyze the flow of a fluid in a channel influenced by a vector field \\\\( \\\\vec{v} = k(x,y,z) \\\\vec{u} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a scalar function of position and \\\\( \\\\vec{u} \\\\) is the original velocity field. The fluid properties are altered by a transformation, described by \\\\( g(\\\\vec{v}) = \\\\vec{v} + \\\\nabla h \\\\), where \\\\( h(x,y,z,t) \\\\) is a scalar field function of space and time.\n\nAfter observing the fluid dynamics at time T, can we determine precisely whether the initial transformation, the corrective transformation, both, or neither were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The fluid dynamic at T can result from various combinations of transformations due to the complexities in the flow's sensitivity to initial conditions and subsequent interventions. Identifying the precise sequence or types of transformations exclusively from the final state can be ambiguous and challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
