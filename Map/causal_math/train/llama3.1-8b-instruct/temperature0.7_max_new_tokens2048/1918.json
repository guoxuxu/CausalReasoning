  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Mz(t) \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. Consider the transformation function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), wherein N is another complex matrix, and explore the system dynamics under various conditions.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at the outset, can we determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "As the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) could have been applied or not at t = 0, the evolving trajectories could vary significantly depending on the properties of N relative to M. Thus, without this knowledge, the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be unambiguously determined from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
