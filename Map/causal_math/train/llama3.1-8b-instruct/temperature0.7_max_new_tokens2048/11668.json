  "Problem": "Consider a heat distribution on a metal rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) represents the temperature at point x and time t, and k is the thermal diffusivity. Assess the effect of a heat source represented by a function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) added at specific points over time.\n\nKnowing just the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T, can we precisely determine whether a cooling intervention was applied, independent of the heat source function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) could be the result of various combinations of initial heat distribution, applied heat sources, and cooling interventions. The effects of cooling could either amplify or mask the effects of the heat source, making it impossible to uniquely decipher the interventions or their specific characteristics based on the final observed state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
