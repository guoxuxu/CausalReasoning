  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation \\\\(L\\{f(t)\\} = F(s)\\) of a function f(t). Assume that the function is multiplied by a time-dependent factor, resulting in a new function \\\\(g(t) = t^n f(t)\\\\) where n is a non-negative integer. Analyze the transformations under various conditions.\n\nGiven the transformed function F(s) from the Laplace transform of g(t), can we recover the original function f(t) without knowing the exponent n used in the time-dependent factor t^n?",
  "Explanation": "Recovering the precise form of f(t) from F(s) without knowing n is not possible because each value of n uniquely alters the transform. Missing this crucial information means we cannot reverse the multiplication effect of \\\\(t^n\\\\) accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
