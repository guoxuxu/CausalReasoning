  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\\\\) representing a surface in 3D space. We are examining the effect of two transformations: \\\\(T1(u,v) = (u+1, v-1)\\\\) and \\\\(T2(u,v) = (uv, u-v)\\\\) on the initial coordinate point \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(T2\\\\) is applied as an intervention at some point after applying \\\\(T1\\\\), will the final value of \\\\(z(x, y)\\\\) be solely dependent on the original point without considering the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(T2\\\\) transforms the coordinates further from \\\\((x_0 + 1, y_0 - 1)\\\\) to potentially more complex values depending on the nature of \\\\(T2\\\\). Since \\\\(z\\\\)'s output is highly dependent on its input coordinates, which are altered by both transformations, the result reflects these cumulative changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
