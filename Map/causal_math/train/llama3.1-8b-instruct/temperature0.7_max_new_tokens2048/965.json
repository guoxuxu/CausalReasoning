  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = xe^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial complex amplitude and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We explore causal relations incorporating the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + ce^{i\\delta t} \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\) being a complex constant and \\\\( \\delta \\\\) a frequency.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = x_0e^{i\\omega 0} \\\\) and the system is then left to evolve under the original dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under the original dynamics to time T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by adding an additional term \\\\( ce^{i\\delta t} \\\\), which evolves differently due to the frequency \\\\( \\delta \\\\). This results in a different trajectory for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) compared to just evolving from \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The superposition of different frequency components will yield distinct outcomes at any given time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
