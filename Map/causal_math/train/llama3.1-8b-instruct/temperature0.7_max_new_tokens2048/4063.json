  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\}(s) = F(s)\\\\). We evaluate how a convolution with a function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant) impacts the transform at a later time \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) = e^{-bt} \\\\) at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the final Laplace transform still simply be \\\\( G(s) = F(s + a) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the convolution function to \\\\( h(t) \\\\), thereby changing the resulting Laplace transform to \\\\( H(s) = F(s + b) \\\\). This modifies the outcome from what would have been just with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
