  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing physical quantities in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied to analyze the system's behavior.\n\nBased on the output at time \\\\( T \\\\), can it be deduced exactly which transformations (any of \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\) or both) were applied throughout the evolution starting from \\\\( z(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying precisely which transformations were applied (either \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), or both) from the system's output at time \\\\( T \\\\) is impractical, due to the non-unique effects these transformations can have. Similar outputs at time \\\\( T \\\\) can be produced by different applications and combinations of transformations, making it impossible to ascertain the exact sequence or type of interventions used only from the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
