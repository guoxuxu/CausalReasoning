  "Problem": "In the context of control theory, consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the state-space equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and B is the input matrix. We examine how the integral transformation defined by \\\\( x_{new}(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bu(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) impacts the system's behavior with respect to input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nAssuming \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied from t=0 and evolves under the system dynamics without any further external modification, does \\\\( x_{new}(t) \\\\) differ from the response \\\\( x(t) \\\\) obtained by directly integrating the state-space equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( x_{new}(t) \\\\) represents the convolution integral of the system's impulse response with the input, which is exactly the solution provided by solving the differential equation directly. Thus, they are equivalent, highlighting the causality in the definition of the system's dynamics in response to \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
