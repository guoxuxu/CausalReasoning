  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) for complex-valued function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) where C is a constant matrix. By defining a complex transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is another constant matrix, we test the effect over a period of time t.\n\nCan the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be accurately retraced from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the initial conditions impacted by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) are indeterminate. If D and C do not commute, or if D influences the dynamics in any significant way, the trajectory cannot be solely reconstructed from C and the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
