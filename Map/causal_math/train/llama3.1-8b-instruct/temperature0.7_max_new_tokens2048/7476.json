  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = f(x, y) \\\\) defined over complex numbers, where \\\\( f(x, y) = e^{Ax + By} \\\\) with A and B being constant complex matrices. This scenario explores the behavior of \\\\( z \\\\) under the linear transformations \\\\( T_x(x, y) = (x+1, y) \\\\) and \\\\( T_y(x, y) = (x, y+1) \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we definitively determine whether transformations \\( T_x \\), \\( T_y \\), or the changed function \\( f' \\) were applied, solely by knowing \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) can be influenced by multiple combinations of matrix transformations and translations in x and y. The modifications by \\( e^A \\), \\( e^B \\), \\( e^C \\), and \\( e^D \\) allow for multiple, indistinguishable paths that yield the same result at \\( z(T) \\), making it impossible to determine the exact interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
