  "Problem": "Investigate the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}w \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where A and B are complex constant matrices, considering the integral transformations over a time interval [0, T].\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) after multiple transformations and an intervention, can we unequivocally deduce the series or nature of transformations and interventions applied (whether \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( w(t) \\\\), \\\\( q(t) \\\\), or combinations thereof)?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of non-commutative matrix operations in the described transformations means that multiple sequences of applying \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( w(t) \\\\), and \\\\( q(t) \\\\) might lead to the same final observation \\\\( w(T) \\\\). Hence, knowing only the end state does not permit accurate backwards deduction of the transformations or interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
