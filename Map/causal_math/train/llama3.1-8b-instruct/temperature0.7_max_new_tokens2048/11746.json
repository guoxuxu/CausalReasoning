  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model that describes the diffusion of a pollutant in a river, represented by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 c}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where c is the concentration of the pollutant and D is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nIf a clean-up effort using a chemical agent that neutralizes the pollutant is introduced at time t_1 > 0, will the concentration of the pollutant at time T be independent of the changes in diffusion coefficient D?",
  "Explanation": "The effectiveness of the clean-up intervention potentially depends on the diffusion coefficient because D influences how quickly and widely the pollutant spreads before it can be neutralized. Higher diffusion could lead to larger areas needing intervention or different dynamics in neutralization.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
