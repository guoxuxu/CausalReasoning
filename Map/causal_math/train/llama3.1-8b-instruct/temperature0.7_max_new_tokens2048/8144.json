  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution in a rod, denoted by \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\), is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To study the effects of external factors, an intervention is modeled by multiplying the initial temperature distribution by a function \\\\(h(x) = e^{-ax}\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\), can we precisely identify what interventions were used (whether \\\\(h(x)\\\\), \\\\(f(x)\\\\), or both), solely by knowing the value at \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity of the heat equation solutions and potential overlapping effects of exponential modifications, the same final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) could be achieved using different combinations or magnitudes of interventions. This ambiguity makes it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions based solely on the final state observation at \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
