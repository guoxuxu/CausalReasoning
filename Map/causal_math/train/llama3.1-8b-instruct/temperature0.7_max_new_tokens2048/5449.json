  "Problem": "Explore the system characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\) with a given constant matrix M. Consider the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) and how different initial conditions affect the system. We assume M and s are such that all operations and the inverse transform are well-defined.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\) and let the transformed system evolve under the differential equation, does \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\) uniquely determine the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at any time T?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of a linear constant coefficient differential equation uniquely determines the state of the system at any time T because the transform encodes all information about the system's dynamic response to initial conditions under the effect of M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
