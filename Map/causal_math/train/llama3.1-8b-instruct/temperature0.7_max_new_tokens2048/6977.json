  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant frequency parameter. We investigate the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed using Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the frequency spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any later time t = T still be represented accurately by \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) merely results in a phase shift of the function, which does not alter the frequency content. Therefore, the initial Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at t = 0 continues to accurately represent the frequency spectrum of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any other time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
