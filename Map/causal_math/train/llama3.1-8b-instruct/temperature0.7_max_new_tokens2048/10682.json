  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ x(t) \\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its response to the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) expressed by \\\\( U(s) \\\\). The system’s impulse response is \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ h(t) \\\\} \\\\), relating the input and output through \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nCan the original form of the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined by observing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\), determining the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) solely from the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is ambiguous unless additional information about \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is provided. The output could theoretically result from various combinations of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( U(s) \\\\), due to the properties of convolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
