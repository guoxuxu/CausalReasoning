  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + k \\\\nabla^2 z = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a diffusion constant. Evaluate how the Laplace transformation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), influences the behavior of the solution.\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is it possible to perfectly reconstruct \\\\( z_0 \\\\), the initial state, without any ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is known for all values of \\\\( s \\\\), the inverse Laplace transform can be used to reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\), including the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The Laplace transformation is unique, and its inversion is uniquely determined for a well-behaved function under appropriate conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
