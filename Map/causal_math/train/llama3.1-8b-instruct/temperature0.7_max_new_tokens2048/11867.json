  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, with an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and an output \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\). Let's assume an additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) is applied where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nKnowing the final output after applying both transformations \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we uniquely identify the sequence or specific factors \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) of the transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The combined transformations obscure the effects of individual factors due to the convolution properties in Laplace transforms and the exponential nature of the functions, making it difficult to separately identify or reverse-engineer \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) uniquely from the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
