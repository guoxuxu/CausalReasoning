  "Problem": "Imagine a system involving heat transfer on a rod modelled by the partial differential equation \\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\), where \\( u \\) represents the temperature, \\( t \\) is the time, and \\( x \\) the position along the rod. The transformation \\( v(x, t) = u(x, t) + h(t)e^{ax} \\) is considered, where \\( h(t) \\) is a specific heat source function and \\( a \\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the observed state \\( v(x, T) \\), can we precisely identify what transformations were applied (whether \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\), \\( s(t)e^{bx} \\), or both), merely using the information on \\( v(x, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to superpositions in the heat profile and the added complexity from non-linear transformations such as \\( h(t)e^{ax} \\) and \\( s(t)e^{bx} \\), different combinations of \\( h(t) \\), \\( s(t) \\), \\( a \\), and \\( b \\) could potentially yield the same observed state \\( v(x, T) \\). This ambiguity prevents a unique backward determination of what specific transformations were applied over the course of the evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
