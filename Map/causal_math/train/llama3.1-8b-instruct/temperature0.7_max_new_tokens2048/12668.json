  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) of \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\), followed by its evolution in time is analyzed.\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u_0)\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\) at t = 0, followed by the normal evolution of the system under \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) without any further intervention, will the state of \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) at any time t be the same as directly evolving \\\\(u_0\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to \\\\(u_0\\\\) changes its initial state in the frequency domain, potentially altering how the system responds to the operator L. The evolution of this transformed state under \\\\(\\\\partial_t u = Lu\\\\) results in a solution which may substantially differ due to changes in initial frequency components and their respective diffusions or propagations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
