  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) to the initial condition \\\\(u_0\\\\), identifying how this transformed state evolves over time.\n\nCan we precisely identify the transformations used (whether \\\\(F(u)\\\\) initially, \\\\(G(u)\\\\) as intervention, or both) by only analyzing the state \\\\(u(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) can emerge from various combinations of transformations and evolution under \\\\(L\\\\). The overlapping effects of \\\\(F\\\\) and \\\\(G\\\\) and their interaction with \\\\(L\\\\) create ambiguities, preventing a unique identification of the interventions based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
