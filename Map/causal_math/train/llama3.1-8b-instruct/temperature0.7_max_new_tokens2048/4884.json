  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, defining a rotation in the complex plane with time. Let's study the system under a transformation specified by the operator \\\\( L \\\\) taken as a Fourier transform, denoted by \\\\( F[\\\\cdot] \\\\).\n\nCan we determine precisely which interventions (specific phase shifts or changes in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)) were applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) only by observing the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in the spectrum can indicate modifications, the precise type of intervention cannot be uniquely determined due to the indistinguishability of phase shifts of \\\\( 2\\\\pi \\\\) and other potential transformations that might result in the same observed spectrum at time \\\\( T \\\\). More detailed temporal analysis or additional phase information is necessary to clearly identify the specifics of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
