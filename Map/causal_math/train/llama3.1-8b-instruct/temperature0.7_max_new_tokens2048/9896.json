  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) is determined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Sz\\\\), where S is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Kt}z\\\\) where K is another constant complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could be achieved through various combinations of transformations and initial conditions due to the complex exponential's influence on both amplitude and phase. This ambiguity prevents the exact identification of interventions or sequence used based only on the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
