  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = i \\\\Delta u + k u \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an initial condition \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) is applied and the system evolves according to its dynamics without further intervention, will the system's state at a later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be affected solely by the properties of \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the evolution is significantly influenced by the constant \\\\( k \\\\), it is also inherently dependent on the Laplacian operator which affects the diffusion characteristics of the function. Therefore, the state at time \\\\( T \\\\) is dependent not only on \\\\( k \\\\) but also on the spatial distribution and second derivatives through \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
