  "Problem": "Consider a mapping defined by the integral transform \\\\( X(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\) where x(t) is a time-dependent function and s is a complex parameter. We explore how changes in the time-domain function influence the result of the integral transform and vice versa.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) be exactly determined at all times t by knowing \\\\( X(s) \\\\) without knowing any prior modifications or features of \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) encapsulates the entire behavior of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) but does not uniquely determine the specifics of transient states or modifications unless the complete inverse transform conditions and additional constraints (like causality or boundedness) are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
