  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function system where the output at any time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the integral transformation \\\\( Z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} X(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( X(t) \\\\) is a complex function and A is a constant complex matrix. Consider the effect of an external control \\\\( u(t) \\\\) which modifies \\\\( X(t) \\\\) as \\\\( X_u(t) = X(t) + u(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven a final state of \\\\( Z(T) \\\\), is it possible to precisely determine the exact form of \\\\( X(t) \\\\) on the interval \\\\([0, T]\\\\) without other data?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integration and complex exponential functions involving A, multiple possible functions \\\\( X(t) \\\\) could result in the same output, \\\\( Z(T) \\\\). The transformation \\\\( e^{A(s-t)} \\\\) complicates reversal of the effect to a unique cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
