  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is the input function. We explore the effects of applying a differentiation operator, defined by \\\\( D_{\\\\alpha}(f)(t) = t^\\\\alpha \\\\frac{d^\\\\alpha}{dt^\\\\alpha} f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a fractional differentiation order.\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can one determine precisely what operations were used (whether \\\\( D_{\\\\alpha}(f)(t) \\\\), \\\\( I_\\\\beta(f)(t) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of differentiation and integration orders could result in similar Laplace transforms due to the overlapping effects in frequency and time-domain alterations. The exact interventions can't be pinpointed uniquely without further information about the sequence or nature of these operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "input function f(t) → Laplace transform F(s); fractional differentiation order α → Dα(f)(t); Dα(f)(t) → F(s); input function f(t) → Iβ(f)(t); Iβ(f)(t) → F(s); α and β are not directly related to each other"
