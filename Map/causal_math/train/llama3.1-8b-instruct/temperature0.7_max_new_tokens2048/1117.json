  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we have a Holomorphic function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane. The integral transformation is given by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is multiplied by a scaling factor \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) at t = 0 (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a non-zero constant), and then allowed to evolve and be transformed as \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformation result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) simply be scaled by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) simply scales the entire integral by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) because the linearity of the integral guarantees that \\\\( \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} \\\\alpha z(t) dt = \\\\alpha \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt = \\\\alpha Z(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
