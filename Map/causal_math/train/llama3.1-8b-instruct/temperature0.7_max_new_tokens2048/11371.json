  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system defined by \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and x is an initial vector. Evaluate the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nIf an intervention via a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied to the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the end position \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on A and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\) introduces additional modification factors. The end position \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is influenced by A, C, and also by D. The interplay of these transformations affects how the state evolves post-intervention, thus all three matrices influence the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
