  "Problem": "We consider the scenario of an electrical circuit with a complex impedance function \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) in the Laplace domain, where \\\\(s\\\\) represents the complex frequency. The causal relationship between voltage input \\\\(V(s)\\\\) and current output \\\\(I(s)\\\\) is given by \\\\(I(s) = \\\\frac{V(s)}{Z(s)}\\\\). We explore the transformations introduced by connecting an additional impedance \\\\(Z_1(s)\\\\) in parallel and series configurations within the circuit.\n\nIf a step voltage \\\\(V(s)\\\\) is applied to the original impedance \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) without adding any additional impedance, will the resulting current \\\\(I(s)\\\\) solely depend on the original configuration \\\\(Z(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of any intervention, the current output \\\\(I(s)\\\\) directly depends on the initial impedance configuration \\\\(Z(s)\\\\), as described by the relation \\\\(I(s) = \\\\frac{V(s)}{Z(s)}\\\\). No additional factors influence the system's behavior in this scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
