  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions defining the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The function is subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Wz \\\\), where \\\\( W \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We study the effect of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ut}z \\\\), where \\\\( U \\\\) is also a constant complex matrix, on the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Vt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( V \\\\) is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) rely only on \\\\( W \\\\) and not on \\\\( U \\\\) or \\\\( V \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) affects the evolution thereafter, meaning the final state at \\\\( T \\\\) will depend on all matrices \\\\( U, V, \\\\) and \\\\( W \\\\), as these transformations can interact in complex ways if the matrices do not commute, influencing the overall trajectory and outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
