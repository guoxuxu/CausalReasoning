  "Problem": "Examine a complex function system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. The system's dynamics are altered by applying transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz^n \\\\) where C is a complex constant and n is a positive integer.\n\nIs it possible to determine the precise initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, lacking the knowledge of whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was implemented?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz^n \\\\) was applied at the outset, the state observed at time T could originate from various potential altered initial conditions under \\\\( g(z) \\\\). This ambiguity, especially given the non-linear nature of the transformation, obfuscates any single solution for \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
