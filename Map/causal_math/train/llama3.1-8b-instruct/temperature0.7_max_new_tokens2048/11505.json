  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output is described as \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector of input variables, and \\\\( H \\\\) is a transformation matrix. The evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. We analyze how the impulse response defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix) affects the system over time.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) without further intervention, will the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( T \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) initially modifies the input state \\\\( x_0 \\\\), which in turn alters the output trajectory. Since \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) changes the initial condition dynamically based on \\\\( D \\\\), and since \\\\( D \\\\) does not necessarily commute with \\\\( M \\\\), the resultant state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and therefore \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
