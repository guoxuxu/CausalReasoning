  "Problem": "Consider a quantum mechanical system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) is governed by the Schrödinger equation with a time-independent Hamiltonian H. We study the effect of applying a linear operator \\\\( U = e^{-iHt} \\\\) on the state vector at different times.\n\nGiven the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to determine uniquely whether the transformation \\\\( U \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( U \\\\) and the natural evolution under the Schrödinger equation produce the same result, it is impossible to determine post hoc whether the initial application of \\\\( U \\\\) occurred, as both scenarios yield the same end state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
