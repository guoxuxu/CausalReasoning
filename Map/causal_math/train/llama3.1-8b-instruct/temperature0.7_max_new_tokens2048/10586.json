  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation system given by \\\\( y = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\\\), where \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Laplace transform. We investigate the change in outcome when a convolution operation with a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant) is applied to the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we determine the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) after observing the Laplace transform of the convolution \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x * h\\}(s) \\\\) without knowing the convolution was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the convolution by \\\\( h(t) \\\\), the transformed signal \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x * h\\}(s) \\\\) cannot be uniquely decomposed back to \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{x\\}(s) \\\\) without additional information because multiple functions could result in the same product in the s-domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "input function x(t) → Laplace transform of x(t); Laplace transform of x(t) → convolution with h(t); convolution with h(t) → Laplace transform of the convolution; Laplace transform of the convolution → inverse Laplace transform; inverse Laplace transform → original function x(t); a → convolution with h(t); s → Laplace transform of the convolution"
