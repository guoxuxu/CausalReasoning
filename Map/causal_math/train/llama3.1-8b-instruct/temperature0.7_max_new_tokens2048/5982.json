  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) are real-valued functions of real variables \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\). We are studying the changes induced by the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) on the function, defined as \\\\( L[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( L[z](s) \\\\), can the original function \\\\( z \\\\) be exactly determined without prior knowledge of whether it's fully composed of \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) functions or not?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear knowledge if \\\\( z \\\\) strictly comprises components \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) which are separate and meet the criteria for Laplace transformation, the exact nature and form of \\\\( z \\\\) can't be fully reconstructed just from \\\\( L[z](s) \\\\). Potential overlaps or additional terms in \\\\( z \\\\) not adhering to the transformable conditions might remain unknown.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
