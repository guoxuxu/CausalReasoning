  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes a transformation through an integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is the input function to the system.\n\nIf the input function \\\\( f(t) = z(t) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under the transformation \\\\( T[f] \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as the untransformed function \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involves an integration of the function multiplied by the matrix exponential, which fundamentally modifies the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from its original form. The interaction between \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega s} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{sA} \\\\) in the integrand results in a function at time T that differs from simply \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
