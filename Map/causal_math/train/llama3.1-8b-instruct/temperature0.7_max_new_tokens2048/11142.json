  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = w^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex variable. We evaluate the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nCan we deduce the original path of \\\\( w \\\\) used in \\\\( z(w) = w^n \\\\) after observing the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without knowing the details of the path taken?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the path of \\\\( w \\\\), especially whether it encircles the origin and how many times, it is impossible to retract uniquely due to the multi-valued nature of the complex power function and its effect on the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
