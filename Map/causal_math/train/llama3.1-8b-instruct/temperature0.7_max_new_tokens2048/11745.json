  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model that describes the diffusion of a pollutant in a river, represented by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 c}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where c is the concentration of the pollutant and D is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nBy observing the spread of the pollutant at time T, can we determine the precise diffusion coefficient D at time t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Despite observing the dispersion pattern at time T, multiple values of the diffusion coefficient D could result in similar spread patterns depending on initial concentrations and other environmental factors. Therefore, D cannot be precisely determined from the effect without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
