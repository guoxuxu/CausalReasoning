  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex function, let \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t governed by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. The transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex number, is applied to study its influence.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant complex number) is applied as an intervention at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of C and depend only on A, B, and D?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another complex exponential effect, which changes the trajectory of the complex function further based on D. Thus, the eventual state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by C (prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) and D (post \\\\( t_1 \\\\)) in addition to the natural evolution parameters A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
