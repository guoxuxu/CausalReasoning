  "Problem": "Consider a system where complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. To investigate the relationship, we introduce a transformation with the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the end position \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(z) \\\\), or both), purely based on the observation of the value at \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations or sequences of transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( j(z) \\\\) might lead to the same or indistinguishably similar end states due to the overlapping effects of matrix exponentials in the complex function scenario. This ambiguity in path trajectories would prevent a definitive conclusion about applied transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
