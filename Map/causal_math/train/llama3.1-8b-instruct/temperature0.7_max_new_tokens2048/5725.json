  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) representing a complex-valued signal over time, where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions. The transformation involves the application of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is described by a simple harmonic motion and later subjected to the Fourier transform, will the Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), show peaks only at the natural frequencies of the initial harmonic motion?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform decomposes the signal into its constituent frequencies. Since the initial motion is harmonic, the transform will exhibit peaks specifically at these natural frequencies, reflecting the signal's frequency content without alteration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "simple harmonic motion → initial z(t); Fourier transform → F(z)(ω); initial z(t) → Fourier transform → F(z)(ω); initial harmonic motion → natural frequencies → F(z)(ω) → peaks at natural frequencies"
