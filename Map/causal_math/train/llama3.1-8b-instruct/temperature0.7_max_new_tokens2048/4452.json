  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The system undergoes an operation defined by the transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}e^{Mt}Ux \\\\), where U is a constant, invertible matrix, and t is the time variable.\n\nGiven knowledge of the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally determine the interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( g(x) \\\\), or both), and their parameters U and V?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) could potentially result from different sequences or types of interventions. The matrix exponentials under different bases (U and V) can produce overlaying effects that are indistinguishable at endpoint alone, especially without explicit knowledge of U and V.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
