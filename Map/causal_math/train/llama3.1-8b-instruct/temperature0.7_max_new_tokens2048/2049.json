  "Problem": "We consider a quantum system where the wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\\\( V(x) \\\\). We study the effect of a measurement operator \\\\( M \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) defined as \\\\( M \\\\psi(x, t_1) = e^{-iH\\\\tau}\\\\psi(x, t_1) \\\\) where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Hamiltonian of the system and \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\) is a measurement time interval.\n\nIf the system state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\\\) is evolved to \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\) under the Schrödinger equation, and then allowed to continue naturally until time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without the application of \\\\( M \\\\), will the state \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) be the same as if the measurement operator was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the measurement operator \\\\( M \\\\) changes the state of the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by altering the phase and probabilities of different components according to the Hamiltonian. This change in state would lead to a different evolution path post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), resulting in a different state at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
