  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. The analysis focuses on the consequences of integral transformations such as the Laplace transform on the time behavior of this system.\n\nIf an additional transformation such as the Fourier transform is applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to the system, and then reverted at \\\\( t_2 \\\\), will the behavior of \\\\( w(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_2 \\\\) be entirely predictable from the initial function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) without considering these transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The application of an intervening transformation like the Fourier, and its reversion, introduces complexity to the system. The behavior of \\\\( w(T) \\\\), while ultimately derived from \\\\( w(z) \\\\), will have been influenced by additional spectral characteristics and shifts introduced and then reverted, which modifies the outcome to some extent from the original trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
