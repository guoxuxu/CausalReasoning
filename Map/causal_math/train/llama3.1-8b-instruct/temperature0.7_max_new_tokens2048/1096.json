  "Problem": "Analyze the impact/casual inference of applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to a continuous-time signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then investigating how the convolution of the resulting function with another function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain affects the original signal domain via the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nGiven a final output observed, can we determine the exact form of the intervenient transformations (whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), convolution with \\\\( h(s) \\\\), with \\\\( g(s) \\\\), or both), solely from the final signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\), the precise determination of whether transformations with \\\\( h(s) \\\\) or \\\\( g(s) \\\\) were utilized (individually or together) is not feasible due to the resulting signal's potential arising from various combinations of these and other transformations. The integral transformations and their effects do not allow for a unique backward calculation to distinctly identify each intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
