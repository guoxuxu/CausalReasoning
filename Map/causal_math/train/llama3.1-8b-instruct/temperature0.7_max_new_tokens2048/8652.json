  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). This system deals with an input signal \\\\( f(t) \\\\) over time t, where the output signal \\\\( F(s) \\\\) represents the system's response in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven an observed output \\\\( F(s) \\\\) different from \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\), can we conclude that interventions took place during the transformation process?",
  "Explanation": "If the output differs from \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s} \\\\) (expected for a unit step function), it strongly indicates that other functions, such as impulses or different intervention mechanisms, have been introduced, altering the original input and the resulting output in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Input signal f(t) → Output signal F(s); System's governing equation → Output signal F(s); Input signal f(t) → System's governing equation; Observed output F(s) → Interventions; Interventions → Input signal f(t)"
