  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a current source I(t) and an impedance Z(s) in the Laplace domain, described by the Laplace transform equation V(s) = I(s)Z(s). We investigate the behavior of voltage V(t) as an exact causal response to the current I(t) through various manipulations involving complex function transformations.\n\nIf the current I(t) is given as \\\\( I(t) = e^{5t} \\\\) and the impedance is \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + 5} \\\\) without any modification, will the transformed voltage output V(t) at a later time t contain frequency components not present in the original I(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The product of the Laplace transforms \\\\( I(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) corresponds to a convolution in the time domain, which, due to the matching exponential terms, results in a scaling of original frequency components without introducing new frequencies. Thus, V(t) retains the same frequency components as I(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
