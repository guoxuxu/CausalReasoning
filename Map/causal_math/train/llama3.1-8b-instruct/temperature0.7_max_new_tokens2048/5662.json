  "Problem": "We explore the impact of a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied on a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Here, \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and we define it as \\\\( L(g(x)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. The differential operator serves as an integral transformation of the function, possibly altering its domain and behavior.\n\nGiven the transformed function after applying \\\\( L \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without additional information about the domain or nature of \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Reversing the transformation imposed by \\\\( L \\\\) without extra information isn't generally feasible. This is because the transformation to the Laplace domain alters the characteristics and many different functions might map to the same transformed expression, illustrating a loss of information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
