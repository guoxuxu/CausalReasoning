  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process characterized by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+ib)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real constants representing decay/growth rates and oscillatory behavior respectively. We explore the consequence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on the process.\n\nCan the original parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) be uniquely determined from the outcome of \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the function form or additional transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) uniquely from just the integral result \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) is challenging due to potential overlap in outcomes from different values of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). Multiple combinations could produce similar integration results, especially without specific knowledge of the decay/growth rates or cyclic behavior inherent to the process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
