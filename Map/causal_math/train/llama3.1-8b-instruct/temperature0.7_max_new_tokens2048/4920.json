  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation on a complex function defined as \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex number. This transformation represents a Laplace transform that is widely used in solving differential equations and analyzing systems. The goal is to explore the manipulation and impacts of such transforms in various configurations, considering intervention by a differential operator.\n\nKnowing the result of the Laplace transform post intervention \\\\(s \\\\cdot T(x(t)) - x(0)\\\\), can we identify without ambiguity the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and the nature of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Given the specific transformation rule and knowing \\\\(s\\\\) as well as the transformation result, one can systematically deduce \\\\(a\\\\) and confirm that the intervention was differentiation, demonstrating a direct causal inference from the observed transform result to the specific prior state and intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
