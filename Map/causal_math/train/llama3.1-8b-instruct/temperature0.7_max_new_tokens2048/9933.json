  "Problem": "Consider the computation of the integral transform \\( I(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) where \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\) and A is a constant complex function. This scenario explores how varying \\( s \\) and operations on \\( f(t) \\) affects the transformation result.\n\nWill \\( I(s) \\) be impacted directly if the rate parameter \\( s \\) of the integral transform is increased without any other intervention on \\( f(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\( s \\) shifts the exponential decay rate in the integral, thereby directly affecting the outcome of \\( I(s) \\). This faster decay leads to a smaller value of \\( I(s) \\), emphasizing the influence of \\( s \\) on the transformed result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
