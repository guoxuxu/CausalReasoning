  "Problem": "We consider the behavior of functions over complex domains and examine the impact of an integral transformation. Let \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) be defined on the complex plane minus the origin z = 0 and let an integral transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\) be defined by \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int_{C} f(z) dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin.\n\nIf a regularization function \\\\( g(z) = z \\\\) is multiplied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before applying the integral transformation \\\\( T(f) \\\\), does the result of \\\\( T(fg) \\\\) remain 2\\\\pi i?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( g(z) = z \\\\) changes the nature of the function from \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) to \\\\( fg(z) = 1 \\\\), a non-singular function over the complex plane, including the origin. The integral over a closed contour of a non-singular function (like a constant 1) results in zero, reflecting a significant change due to this intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
