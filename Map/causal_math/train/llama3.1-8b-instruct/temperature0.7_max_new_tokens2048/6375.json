  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transform with a kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-s^2} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to analyze its effect over time t.\n\nIf an intervention is made by modifying the integral transform kernel to \\\\( K'(t, s) = e^{-s} \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant function at any later time T depend only on the new kernel and not on the original kernel?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the kernel of the transform, which impacts how the original and resultant functions are related. Both kernels, the original and the modified one, influence the resulting function through their respective effects on the frequency and decay characteristics of the transformed signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
