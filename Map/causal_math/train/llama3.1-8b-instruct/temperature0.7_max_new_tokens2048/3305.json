  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous dynamical system represented by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform to the system which transforms the original function \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k,t)\\\\), followed by the application of an inverse transformation afterwards.\n\nIf the Fourier transform is applied to the initial state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) and then evolved under the transformed differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\hat{u}}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\hat{L}\\\\hat{u}\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at T after applying the inverse transform be identical to if the initial state \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) was directly evolved to T under the original equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform and its inverse are linear and their composition is the identity when appropriately applied. Thus, transforming to the Fourier space, evolving there, and transforming back, should ideally yield the same result as evolving directly in the original space, assuming transformations are properly handled and inverses exist.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
