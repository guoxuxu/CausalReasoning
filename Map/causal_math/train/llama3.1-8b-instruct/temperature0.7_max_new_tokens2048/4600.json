  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\int \\\\frac{f(w)}{w - z} dw \\\\), where \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is an analytic function defined on a complex domain excluding the point z. The integral is calculated over a closed contour enclosing z. We want to infer changes and effects of applying transformations based on the function \\\\( h(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and knowing that either \\\\( h(w) \\\\), \\\\( j(w) \\\\), or both were applied to the contour, can we determine precisely which transformation(s) were executed?",
  "Explanation": "As any rotations applied to the contour via \\\\( h(w) \\\\) or \\\\( j(w) \\\\) do not affect the result of the integral for an analytic function, it is impossible to pinpoint which transformations, if any, had been carried out based solely on the computed value of \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The effect of each, or both transformations collectively, on the integral result is indiscernible.",
