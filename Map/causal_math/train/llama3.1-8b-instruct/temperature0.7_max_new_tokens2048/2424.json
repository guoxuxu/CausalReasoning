  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) \\, ds \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent control function.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can one infer the precise sequence or nature of adjustments (whether original, modified, or intervention) just by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different functions u and adjustments v appearing in the integral convolution could lead to the same observed end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Without additional information about the timing or nature of these functions, it's not feasible to trace back uniquely to specific adjustments or the original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
