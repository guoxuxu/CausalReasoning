  "Problem": "Consider a physical system characterized by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) represents a potential function in a field. The transformation applied is through a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex representation of spatial coordinates.\n\nGiven the potential field \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y, T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) merely by analyzing \\\\(\\\\phi(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the potential field at \\\\( T \\\\) is highly ambiguous due to the nonlinearity and complex influence of Laplace's equation solutions on boundary conditions and transformations. Different manipulations can lead to similar fields, making the exact sequence or type of interventions indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation → Potential Field; Potential Field → Spatial Coordinates; Spatial Coordinates → Complex Representation; Complex Representation → f(z) or g(z); f(z) or g(z) → φ(x, y, T); φ(x, y, T) → φ(T)"
