  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) on the signal and explore varying the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).\n\nGiven the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane from t = 0 to T, can we determine precisely if there was an intervention such as a change in frequency midway, based solely on this trajectory?",
  "Explanation": "The trajectory alone, particularly if only observed for a single cycle or incomplete information, might not reveal if a change in frequency occurred without additional timing information or a baseline for comparison. Multiple setups or frequency shifts could result in similar trajectories.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
