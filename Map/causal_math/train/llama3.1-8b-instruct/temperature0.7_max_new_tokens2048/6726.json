  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( z \\\\) a complex number. A Fourier transform transformation \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to the transformed function, making it \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). We will explore the implications of modifying the power \\\\( n \\\\) and the transformation's effect on \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nObserving a narrower peak in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we infer that \\\\( n \\\\) was increased?",
  "Explanation": "A narrower peak in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) suggests that the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was spread wider in the time domain, which is a characteristic effect of increasing the power \\\\( n \\\\) in \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
