  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system where the value of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is driven by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = f(z) \\\\), with \\\\( f(z) \\\\) being a nonlinear function of z. The causal influence of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant, is investigated at different time intervals.\n\nAfter observing the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time T, can we trace back and definitively determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) assuming no intervention apart from the initial condition set by either \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( g(z_0) = z_0^2 + c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the initial state, and due to the nonlinear nature of both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine whether the initial state was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_0^2 + c \\\\) from the state observed at time T. The nonlinear dependency introduces ambiguity in causal inference from effect back to cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
