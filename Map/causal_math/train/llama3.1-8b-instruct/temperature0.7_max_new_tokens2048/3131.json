  "Problem": "Consider an integrable complex function \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where \\\\(x \\\\) is a real variable. This scenario explores the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) and its complex conjugate transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{\\\\overline{z(t)}\\\\}(s) \\\\) with respect to a variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = t*z(t) \\\\) is applied at a certain point and then a second Laplace transformation is performed, does the second Laplace transform depend only on the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) or also on the manner of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation alters the function before it is subjected to the second Laplace transformation, introducing a new dependency not only on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) but also significantly on how \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is defined. This intervention impacts the resulting Laplace transformation, thus affecting the s-domain representation and making it reliant on the type and nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
