  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and the function maps a real value \\\\(t\\\\) to a point on the complex unit circle. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = Az\\\\), where A is a complex square matrix, at different times.\n\nCan we unambiguously deduce the initial value \\\\(z_0\\\\) from the observed transformation at any later time \\\\(t\\\\) if the system was subjected to \\\\(f(z)\\\\) at the beginning without knowing the details of \\\\(A\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstruction of \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(Az(t)\\\\) without explicit knowledge of \\\\(A\\\\) is generally not feasible since the transformation can significantly alter the trajectory and phase of the state, especially without commutativity between \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
