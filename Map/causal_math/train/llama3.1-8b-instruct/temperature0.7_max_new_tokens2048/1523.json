  "Problem": "Consider the fluid dynamics described by the Navier-Stokes equations. Let \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,t) \\\\) represent the velocity field of a fluid, where \\\\( x \\\\) is the position and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We investigate the behavior of the fluid under a transformation \\\\( f(\\\\vec{u}) = \\\\nabla \\\\times (\\\\vec{u}) \\\\), which represents the curl of the velocity field.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the Stokes' transformation \\\\( g(\\\\vec{u}) = \\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\vec{u}) \\\\) (the divergence) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original Navier-Stokes equations and not on the applied transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(\\\\vec{u}) \\\\) adds a new dynamic by modifying the divergence of the field, potentially altering fluid density and pressure fields. This intervention influences how the fluid evolves from t_1 to T, making the endpoint not solely dependent on the original fluid properties defined by the Navier-Stokes equations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
