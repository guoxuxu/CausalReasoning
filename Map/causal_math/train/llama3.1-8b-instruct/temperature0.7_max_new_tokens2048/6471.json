  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) representing a time-varying signal, and its Fourier Transform (FT) as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\). We investigate the impact of two operations: multiplication by a real exponential \\\\( e^{-at} \\\\) and differentiation with respect to time \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\).\n\nIf the signal is first transformed to \\\\( z'(t) = e^{-at}z(t) \\\\), and then differentiated with respect to time, will the Fourier Transform of this derivative depend solely on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and not on the decaying factor \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The differentiation of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) introduces additional modifications in both the amplitude and phase within the Fourier Transform. The derivative operation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\) amplifies the frequency component by \\\\( i\\\\omega - a \\\\), making the result dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the decay parameter \\\\( a \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
