  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation in one dimension described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is the temperature distribution and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention in the form of a new function \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\mu t}u \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is a constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend on both \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) acts as another layer of transformation on the already evolving system, scaling the current state further. This intervention makes the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial exponential transformation through \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and the subsequent intervention through \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
