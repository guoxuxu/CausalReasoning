  "Problem": "Consider a series of kinematic equations \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t) = \\\\vec{x}_0 + \\\\vec{v}_0t + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\vec{a}t^2\\\\) in a physics simulation space, where \\\\(\\\\vec{a}\\\\) is the acceleration vector. Analyze how applying a transformation matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that scales and rotates the initial velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}_0\\\\) affects the position vector \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(t)\\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation matrix \\\\( N \\\\) is applied to the velocity \\\\(\\\\vec{v}(t_1)\\\\) as an intervention, will the final position \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by the kinematic equations and not by the transformations \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation matrix \\\\( N \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the velocity at that instance and therefore alters the trajectory from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\). Both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) play significant roles in determining the final position \\\\(\\\\vec{x}(T)\\\\), combined with the natural evolution dictated by the kinematic equations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
