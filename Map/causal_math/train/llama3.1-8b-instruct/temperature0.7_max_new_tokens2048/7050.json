  "Problem": "Consider a linear function \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, used to transform complex vector input \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is determined by the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{Dt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial state of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the state of the system \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we infer whether the initial vector was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( Cz_0 \\\\), assuming we know the transformation matrix \\\\( C \\\\) but not the initial state?",
  "Explanation": "Without a priori knowledge of whether \\\\( C \\\\) was applied initially, it's challenging to distinguish if \\\\( z(T) \\\\) came from \\\\( e^{DT}z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{DT}(Cz_0) \\\\). The determinant and eigenvalues of C relative to D make this reverse inference unreliable unless specific properties about the commutation of C and D are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
