  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process where the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dx = Ax \\\\, dt + B \\\\, dW \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) refers to a Wiener process increment. An operator \\\\( T_t \\\\) defined by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is constant is considered as a transformation.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T_t(x) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and the process evolves under the given stochastic differential equation, will the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) be identical to the evolution that starts from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without applying \\\\( T_t \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the transformation \\\\( T_t(x) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) to the initial state modifies the starting point of the stochastic process. As a result, the influence of the transformation matrix exponential along with the stochastic nature of the evolution makes the final state different from what it would be starting directly from \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
