  "Problem": "In a complex domain, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time \\\\( t \\\\), representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The time evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Hz \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a complex constant. We consider alterations in this system's behavior by applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being another complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Hz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Hz \\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by introducing a complex exponential factor, which alters the trajectory of the system's evolution. This results in a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the multiplication by \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) at t = 0, thereby changing the path of evolution compared to the untransformed initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
