  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where z(t) is a complex function and s is a complex parameter. This transformation is a Laplace transform of the function z(t). Study the implications of differentiating and integrating the function z(t) under different scenarios.\n\nIf we observe the resulted Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) from an unknown function after possible differentiation or integration, can we determine whether the original function was differentiated, integrated, or left as is?",
  "Explanation": "The observed Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) could equally result from initial functions that were manipulated differently (differentiated, integrated, or unchanged) due to equivalency in mathematical outcomes under certain conditions and the general ambiguity introduced by initial or boundary conditions. Thus, determination of the original manipulation requires more specific information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
