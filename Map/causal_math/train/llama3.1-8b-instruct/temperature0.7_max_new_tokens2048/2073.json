  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation on a complex function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) given by \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int e^{tz} g(t) dt \\\\), where the integral is taken over a suitable contour in the complex plane. We explore how the transformation affects the inversion of the function via the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nDoes applying the transform \\\\( G(z) \\\\) to a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) followed by its inverse Laplace transform without any intervention return the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) exactly?",
  "Explanation": "Provided that all conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the Laplace transform and its inverse are met—specifically those regarding convergence and analyticity of \\\\( g(t) \\\\)—the operations of transformation and inverse transformation are exact inverses of each other according to the properties of the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
