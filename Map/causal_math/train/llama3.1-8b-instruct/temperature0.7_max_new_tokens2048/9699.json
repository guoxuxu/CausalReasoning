  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Av \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of applying a Fourier transform on a function representing vector components \\\\( v(t) \\), where \\\\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention occurs at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) applying a Laplace transform to \\\\( v(t) \\\\), will the final state \\\\( v(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the properties of A?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces a change in both the time and frequency domain properties of \\\\( v(t) \\\\). This transforms the system's response from that point onwards, thus the end state at T > t_1 is influenced by the characteristics of the Laplace transform and not just by A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
