  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) as a Laplace transformation applied on a time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). We further explore the effects of an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and t is time variable.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied at t = 0 to a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\), and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is computed, does this affect the outcome compared to applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) directly to \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) without using \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) modifies the function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) before applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), potentially altering the frequencies or behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This modified function, when transformed using the Laplace transform, will generally yield a different result than if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) were applied directly to the unmodified \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
