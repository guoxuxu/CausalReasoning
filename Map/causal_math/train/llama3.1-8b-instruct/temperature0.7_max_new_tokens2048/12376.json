  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem in the context of an operator \\( L \\) defined on a complex function space whereby \\( Lf = \\lambda f \\). We analyze the effects of altering this relation by an integral transform \\( T \\) defined by \\( (Tf)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x,t)f(t) dt \\), where \\( k(x, t) \\) is a given kernel function.\n\nIf the transformation \\( T \\) is applied to a function \\( f \\) that is an eigenfunction of \\( L \\) with eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\), and \\( T \\) is known not to commute with \\( L \\), will \\( T f \\) necessarily be an eigenfunction of \\( L \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( T \\) does not commute with \\( L \\), applying \\( T \\) to an eigenfunction \\( f \\) of \\( L \\) could alter the function so that it is no longer an eigenfunction of \\( L \\). The non-commutativity implies that the order of operations between \\( T \\) and \\( L \\) affects the output, hence \\( L(Tf) \\neq \\lambda (Tf) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
