  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution across an object is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature, \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity, and \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We investigate the effects of applying a thermal source function described by \\\\( f(u) = \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} u \\\\) on the temperature distribution over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf the function \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the temperature distribution \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the thermal source \\\\( f(u) \\\\) initially modifies the temperature distribution due to \\\\( \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} u \\\\) that decays exponentially with time but impacts the initial and subsequent temperature distribution at T, altering the system's trajectory away from that due solely to diffusive spread.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
