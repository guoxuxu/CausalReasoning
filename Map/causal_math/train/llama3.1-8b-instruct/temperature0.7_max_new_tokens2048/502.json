  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform of a function g(t) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(t)) = G(s) \\\\). We analyze how applying different initial conditions affects the inverse transform at a specific time T, where the initial conditions are modified by a constant k.\n\nGiven the function h(T) which resulted from the initial conditions modified by k, can we deduce the original function g(T) at T without knowing the value of k?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the scaling factor k, it is impossible to accurately deduce g(T) from h(T) because different values of k can lead to many possible values of g(T).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
