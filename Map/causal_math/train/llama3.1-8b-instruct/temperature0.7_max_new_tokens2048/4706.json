  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing the amplitude and angular frequency respectively. For analysis, a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) is used, representing a Fourier transform component.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) over time T, can we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Although \\\\( f(z) \\\\) provides information about the amplitude of the frequency component at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), it does not provide phase or components at other frequencies. Thus, the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alone without more information on other frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
