  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L: V \\\\rightarrow W \\\\) mapping between vector spaces V and W. We analyze the effect of a specific transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described as a multiplication by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\), acting on vector space V before and after applying operator L.\n\nIf an intervention transform \\\\( S(v) = Nv \\\\), where N is another matrix, is applied at some stage before applying L, will the final output in W only depend on L and not on M or N?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) can alter the vectors in such a way that the final outcome is a function of M, N, and L. If these matrices don't commute, each can uniquely influence the resultant vector in W.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
