  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane dynamics described by the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ u(t) \\} = U(s) \\) of a temporal function \\( u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t < 0 \\). We study the effect of a convolution operator defined by \\( h(t) \\) over the signal \\( u(t) \\), resulting in \\( v(t) = (h * u)(t) \\).\n\nIf we observe \\( V(s) \\), can we deduce \\( U(s) \\) without intervention or additional information about \\( H(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\( H(s) \\), retrieving \\( U(s) \\) from \\( V(s) \\) is not feasible directly, since \\( V(s) = H(s)U(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\) could be any function modifying \\( U(s) \\), including shifts, scaling, or filtering effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
