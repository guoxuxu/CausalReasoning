  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing a system's state over time. The system is subjected to an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and allowed to evolve under its own dynamics without further intervention, will the output of the transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be solely dependent on the natural progression of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since no intervention is applied, \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) computes the integral based solely on the natural progression of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting from its intrinsic properties governed by dynamics up to time \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
