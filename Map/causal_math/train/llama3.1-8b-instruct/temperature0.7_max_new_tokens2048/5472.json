  "Problem": "Analyze causal behavior in a system undergoing Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\). Scenario dives into whether the performance and predictions of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems governed by convolution integrals \\\\( (f * g)(t) = \\\\int_0^t f(\\\\tau) g(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) can be inferred or influenced by certain transformation functions.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform of the output \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y)(s) \\\\) at a particular time post-intervention, can the exact nature of the intervention (the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)) be determined unambiguously?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation provides the final sum effect in the Laplace domain, but without specific details on how contributions individually govern the result. Multiple configurations of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) could yield the same transformed output due to integral and transformation properties, thereby not allowing an unambiguous determination of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
