  "Problem": "Consider a linear integral transformation given by \\\\(I[f(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} K(t, s) f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(K(t, s)\\\\) is a kernel function. We investigate the impact of a control function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) added to the input function \\\\( f(s) \\\\), resulting in a modified input \\\\( f(s) + h(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of the transformation, \\\\( I[f(t)] \\\\) when \\\\( h(s) = 0 \\\\), can we trace back uniquely to the function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) without knowing whether a control function was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the original function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( I[f(t)] \\\\) is not feasible without explicit knowledge of \\\\( h(s) \\\\). Any modifications by \\\\( h(s) \\\\), unless zero, cannot be distinguished solely from the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
