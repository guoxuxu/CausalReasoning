  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t)dt \\\\. Analyze the causal impact on the transformed function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) given an intervention \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) with an additional function \\\\( g(t) = e^t \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\).\n\nWill the Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) of the function \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\) follow the standard transformation without any modification to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) throughout the time?",
  "Explanation": "Since there is no intervention or external modification to \\\\( h(t) = t^2 \\\\), the Laplace Transform will strictly follow the standard transformation given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{2}{s^3} \\\\), assuming ideal conditions without external influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
