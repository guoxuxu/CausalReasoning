  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. For analysis, we apply a Fourier transform to change the domain from time to frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\( F_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) dt \\\\), which converts the time-domain function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) into its frequency-domain counterpart.\n\nIf an external force represented by a function \\\\(g(t)\\\\) is introduced into the differential equation at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) leading to a new equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = g(t)\\\\), and the Fourier transform is applied thereafter, does the frequency domain representation depend solely on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not on \\\\(g(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(g(t)\\\\) modifies the system's equation, resulting in a different frequency-domain representation, expressed as \\\\(-\\\\omega^2 F_x(\\\\omega) + \\\\omega^2 F_x(\\\\omega) = F_g(\\\\omega)\\\\). The output in the frequency domain now includes terms dependent on the Fourier transform of \\\\(g(t)\\\\), thus influencing the resultant frequency spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
