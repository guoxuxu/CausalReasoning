  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions. We explore the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) on these components separately and together.\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) separately and calculate \\\\( L[u(t) + iv(t)] \\\\), will this result be the same as calculating \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\) directly?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a linear operator, meaning that \\\\( L[u(t) + iv(t)] = L[u(t)] + iL[v(t)] \\\\). Therefore, applying the Laplace transform to each component separately and then combining them will yield the same result as applying the transform directly to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
