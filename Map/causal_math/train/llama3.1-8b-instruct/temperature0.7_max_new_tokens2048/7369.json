  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time linear system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We examine the behavior of the system under the influence of a linear transformation \\( h(x) = Mx \\), where M is a transformation matrix.\n\nIf \\( h(x) \\) is applied to an initial state \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) without further intervention, will the state \\( x(t) \\) at t = T be equivalent to evolving \\( x_0 \\) directly under \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( h(x) \\) modifies \\( x_0 \\) to \\( Mx_0 \\), setting a different initial condition. Given that \\( M \\) might not commute with \\( D \\), the solution \\( x(t) = e^{Dt}Mx_0 \\) at t = T will generally differ from \\( e^{Dt}x_0 \\) unless \\( M \\) and \\( D \\) have specific commutative properties or \\( M \\) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
