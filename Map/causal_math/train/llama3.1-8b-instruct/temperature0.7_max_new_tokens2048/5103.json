  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) describing heat distribution along a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) with constant diffusivity k. Investigate the implications of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x, t)e^{-i\\\\omega x}dx \\\\) applied to this model.\n\nIf an intervention applies a filtering function \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) modifying \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) \\\\) at time t_1, will the solution at time T, \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), be solely decided by the heat equation ignoring the effects of \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filtering function \\\\( g(\\\\omega) \\\\) alters the spectral components of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), thereby changing the outcome \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\). Thus, \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) depends not only on the heat equation but also critically on the filter applied, impacting diffusion characteristics across frequencies.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
