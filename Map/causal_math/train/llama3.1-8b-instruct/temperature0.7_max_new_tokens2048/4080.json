  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) represent real functions of time and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We evaluate the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at a later time, can we determine whether only the Laplace transform, only the Fourier transform, or both were used during the evolution, based solely on \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different transformations and their interactions lead to overlapping results in the Laplace domain, making it ambiguous to determine distinctly whether a Laplace transform, a Fourier transform, or both were applied just based on the final Laplace domain representation due to non-invertible blending of transformation effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
