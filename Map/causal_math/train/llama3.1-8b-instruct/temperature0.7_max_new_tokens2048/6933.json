  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\( z \\), respectively. The evolution of \\( z \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\), where \\( M \\) is a constant matrix. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( N \\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\( f(z) \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\) at an arbitrary \\( t_0 \\) and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\) without further intervention, will \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) (where \\( T > t_0 \\)) be the same as if \\( z(t_0) \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( f(z) \\) modifies the path of \\( z(t) \\) by integrating the exponential transformation \\( e^{Ns} \\) up to \\( t_0 \\). The resulting state at \\( t_0 \\) is different and thus evolves differently under \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\), leading to a different state at \\( t = T \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
