  "Problem": "Examine the relationship in a mechanical system governed by the Laplace-transformed equation \\\\(L{\\\\ddot{x} + k\\\\dot{x} + mx} = F(s)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\), and \\\\(m\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(F(s)\\\\) is the Laplace transform of a force function. We investigate the effects of applying different inverse transformations representing procedural changes.\n\nIf after a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intrinsic system modification is made, altering the constants to \\\\(k'\\\\) and \\\\(m'\\\\), will the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) be independent of the transformations in \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The system modification changes the differential equation parameters, affecting the system's response to the same input function. Hence, the displacement \\\\(x(t)\\\\) for \\\\(t > t_1\\\\) remains dependent on both the prior and post-intervention parameters (\\\\(k, m\\\\) and  \\\\(k', m'\\\\)), influencing system dynamics overall.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
