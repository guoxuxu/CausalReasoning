  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined on the complex plane as \\(z(t) = e^{At}z_0\\), where \\(A\\) is a complex constant and \\(z_0\\) is the initial complex value. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation given by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) \\, ds \\) on the system, where \\(B\\) is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\( T(z) \\), \\( I(z) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex interrelations and possible overlap in effects brought by \\( T(z) \\) and \\( I(z) \\), it becomes extremely challenging to attribute the observed end state \\( z(T) \\) uniquely to specific transformations. The compositional effects of these integral transformations blur the lines between direct and mediated influence pathways.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
