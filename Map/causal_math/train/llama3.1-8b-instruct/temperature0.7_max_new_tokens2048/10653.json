  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a complex constant. We are evaluating whether the Laplace transformation \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) applied to this function affects its causal inference properties.\n\nIf the Laplace transformation is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), and then the original function is allowed to evolve without further transformations, will the Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) \\\\) differ depending on whether the effect of \\\\( a \\\\) is time-varied?",
  "Explanation": "The nature of \\\\( a \\\\) as a complex constant directly affects the Laplace transform by altering its poles, specifically affecting the exponential term in the integrand. Time-variation in \\\\( a \\\\) introduces new dynamics that alter the convergence and the nature of the resulting transform, reflecting changes in the system's stability and response over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
