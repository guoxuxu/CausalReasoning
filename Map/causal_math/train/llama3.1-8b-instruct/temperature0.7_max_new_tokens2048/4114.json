  "Problem": "We examine a signal transformation using the Laplace transform in an electrical circuit. The input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is passed through a linear time-invariant system characterized by its impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system output, \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is studied in the Laplace domain by applying \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( X(s) \\\\) are the Laplace transforms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\), respectively.\n\nGiven the output in the Laplace domain \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), can it be conclusively determined which input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) produced it without additional context?",
  "Explanation": "No, because the transformation through \\\\( H(s) \\\\) may not be uniquely invertible without knowing the specific form of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). Multiple different input functions can produce the same output under different system responses, hence the exact input cannot be identified solely from the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
