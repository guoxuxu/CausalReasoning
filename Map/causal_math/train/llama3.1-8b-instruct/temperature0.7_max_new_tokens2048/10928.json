  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation through a Laplace Transform given by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). The impact of manipulating \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) (a complex number in the Laplace Transform) on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is studied.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) after unknown interventions on \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can we precisely determine the sequence or nature of changes applied to \\\\( \\omega \\\\) during the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The end transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) consolidates the effect of the interventions into a single output, which lacks detailed information about the history or sequence of changes in \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Multiple sequences of interventions could yield equivalent forms in the Laplace domain, obfuscating the exact changes made during the process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
