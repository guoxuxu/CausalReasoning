  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the vector field is governed by the Laplace Transform \\( L \\{ v(t) \\} = sV(s) - v(0) \\), with \\( v(t) = e^{At}v_0 \\) where A is a constant matrix. We'll examine the effects of perturbing this system with another transform \\( f(v) = e^{Bt}v \\) where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(v) = e^{Ct}v \\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( v(T) \\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention with \\( g(v) \\) introduces another vector transformation factor alongside \\( e^{Bt} \\), making the final state \\( v(T) \\) dependent on the complex interplay of A, B, and C. These matrix transformations can compound or negate each other's effects on the system's trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
