  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time. The transformation applied is \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{i\\\\beta t}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a different constant frequency) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original behavior and not on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(z)\\\\) introduces a new rotation depending on \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) from time \\\\(t_1\\\\) onward, which modifies the trajectory started by \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). The endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\) will be influenced by both the original rotation rate \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and the intervention \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), complicating the system's overall dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
