  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex scalar function z(t) governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(wt)\\\\), where A and B are complex constants, and w is a real constant. We evaluate the effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\(h(z) = e^{Ct}z + D\\\\), where C and D are complex constants, at different points in time.\n\nGiven the trajectory \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T, can we infer the original complex function \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge about the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\), the original condition prior to any interventions or transformations cannot be uniquely determined. The additional constant \\\\(D\\\\) introduced by \\\\(h(z)\\\\) modifies the initial state, making it impossible to exactly reverse engineer \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
