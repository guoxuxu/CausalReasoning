  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. Consider the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) (where D is a different constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\( z(T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\( h(z) \\) changes the state again at time \\( t_1 \\), the ultimate state \\( z(T) \\) will depend on the interactions between A, C, and D. These interactions potentially modify the trajectory profoundly depending on how these matrices relate to each other, further complicated by any non-commutative properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
