  "Problem": "Consider an integrable complex function \\\\( z(x) \\\\), where \\\\(x \\\\) is a real variable. This scenario explores the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) and its complex conjugate transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{\\\\overline{z(t)}\\\\}(s) \\\\) with respect to a variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the final s-domain result of the compound transformations (initial and intervention), can we determine the exact original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and the specific intervention applied?",
  "Explanation": "Even with full knowledge of the final s-domain result after several transformations, deciphering backwards to identify the specific intervention and accurately reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is complex and often ambiguous. Different combinations of functions and interventions could potentially lead to similar or identical s-domain expressions, especially considering the non-injective nature of such transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
