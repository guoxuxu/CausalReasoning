  "Problem": "Evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform on a causal system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -Ax + u(t) \\\\), where A is a constant scalar and u(t) is an external input. Assume \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of u(t) and consider the impact of transforming the initial conditions via a convolution with another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we accurately deduce the original input function u(t) by Fourier transforming the output x(t) of the system and analyzing it without knowing the specific dynamics of the system?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the system parameter A and how it influences the transmission and attenuation of frequencies, it is not possible to uniquely reconstruct u(t) from the Fourier-transformed output \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), especially due to potential loss of information regarding phase and magnitude modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
