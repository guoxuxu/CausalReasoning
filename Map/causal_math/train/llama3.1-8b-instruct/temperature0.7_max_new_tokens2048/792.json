  "Problem": "Study the effect of a complex function \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iz} \\\\) on a real variable \\\\( x \\\\) and its integration relating to the Fourier transform of a signal \\\\( s(t) \\), represented as \\\\( S(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} s(t) e^{-i2\\pi f t} dt. \\\\)\n\nCan the exact nature of the intervention (the transformation \\\\( z \\mapsto e^{iz} \\\\), normalization, both, or none) be determined solely by observing the resultant Fourier transform \\\\( S'(f) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The potential overlap of effects from the transformation and normalization on the Fourier transform's amplitude and phase spectrum makes it impossible to exclusively determine the nature or sequence of interventions, as different combinations could yield similar outcomes in \\\\( S'(f) \\\\).",
