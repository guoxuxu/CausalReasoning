  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex plane defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We evaluate the impact of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) applied at t = 0, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had been simply evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the initial state from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} z_0 \\\\), impacting the entire trajectory of the solution. The subsequent evolution leads to a modified solution influenced by both \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), resulting in a state at t = T that differs from the simple evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
