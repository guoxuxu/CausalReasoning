  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\), where L is inductance, R is resistance and E(t) represents a time-dependent electromotive force. Further, suppose that an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by multiplying the current amplitude by a scalar \\\\( k \\\\) is applied, and we explore how this affects the response of the system over time t.\n\nIf a new function \\\\( S(I) = mI \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is a constant scalar) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely exclusively on the resistance \\\\( R \\\\) and not on \\\\( L \\\\) or the electromotive force \\\\( E(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(I) = mI \\\\) would modify the current at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and subsequently affect how the system's dynamics evolve under the influence of L, R, and E(t). Since the circuit's response involves all these parameters, the operation \\\\( mI \\\\) integrates with them and influences the resultant current at any later time \\\\( T \\\\), based on the ongoing equation dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
