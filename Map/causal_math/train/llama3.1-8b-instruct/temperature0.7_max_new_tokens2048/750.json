  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( z(t) = t^2 + it \\\\) mapping the real variable t into the complex plane. We analyze this function under the complex Fourier transform, defined by \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) from the transformation, can we uniquely determine the quadratic and linear coefficients of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The coefficients of t in the quadratic and linear terms of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) uniquely contribute to specific parts of the Fourier transform due to the nature of the transformation of polynomial and linear terms. Thus, these coefficients can be determined from examining their signatures in \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
