  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where t is time. We analyze the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is calculated for a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T, will \\\\( T(z) \\\\) merely return the integral of the original function without any alteration in the function's behavior?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), which computes the integral from 0 to T, directly evaluates the path of \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) during that interval. Therefore, \\\\( T(z) \\\\) reflects the cumulative sum of the exponential function over time without any modification to its behavior throughout the interval.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
