  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(iA + B)t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, and A and B are real constants. This function is used to transform the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-(iA + B)t} z(t) dt \\\\) affects the output over a period T.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is used as an input to \\\\( I(z) \\\\) as defined, without any intervention during the interval [0, T], will \\\\( I(z) \\\\) yield a real number exclusively dependent on B?",
  "Explanation": "While the transformation and integration are dependent on both A and B, due to the oscillatory (sinusoidal) nature introduced by the term involving A (imaginary unit oscillation), and damping or growth depending on B, the integral does not simplify to depend only on B. The resulting complex integral typically involves contributions from both the real and imaginary components affected by A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
