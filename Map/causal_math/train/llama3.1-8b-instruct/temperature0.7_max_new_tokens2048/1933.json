  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system where the stock price follows a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is the drift rate, \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) the volatility, and \\\\( dW \\\\) a Brownian motion increment. We apply a Fourier transform \\\\( F(f) \\\\) to transform the probability density function of the stock price.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(f) \\\\) is applied to the initial probability density at time t = 0 and evolved under its natural stochastic dynamics \\\\( dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW) \\\\) without further intervention, will the characteristic function at time T be the same as if it was directly evolved?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform alters the form of the probability distribution from a time-domain representation to a frequency-domain representation. The subsequent evolution under the stochastic differential equation affects this transformed state in a manner distinct from the direct evolution of the probability density function, leading to different characteristics at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
