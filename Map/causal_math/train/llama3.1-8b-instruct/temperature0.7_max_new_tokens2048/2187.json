  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\( L\\{y(t)\\} = Y(s) \\), where \\( y(t) \\) is a function in the time domain and \\( Y(s) \\) is its corresponding representation in the complex frequency domain. Assume an initial condition \\( y(0) = y_0 \\) and study the effects of an impulse response \\( h(t) \\) applied to this system, represented in the Laplace domain by \\( H(s) \\).\n\nIf at any point a modifying function \\( M(s) = e^{-as} \\) (where a is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final product \\( M(s)Y(s)H(s) \\) still be a valid transformation representing the system's state?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( M(s) \\) modifies \\( Y(s) \\) before it interacts with \\( H(s) \\). The transformation, representing an exponential decay in the time domain, still maintains the validity of linear transformations in the Laplace domain, representing the system's state accurately under these conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
