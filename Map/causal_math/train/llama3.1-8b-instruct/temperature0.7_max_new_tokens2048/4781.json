  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\), respectively. The evolution of this function over time is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant complex-valued matrix. Study the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is a complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{Qt} z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which changes the trajectory of the system dynamically. The nature of \\\\( Q \\\\) relative to \\\\( P \\\\) may influence how the state evolves over time, leading to a different state at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
