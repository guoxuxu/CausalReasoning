  "Problem": "Assume the function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the complex differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number, represents a physical process. We explore the effects of the operation \\( h(z) = e^{kt}z \\) on \\( z(t) \\), with \\( k \\) being another real constant.\n\nCan we infer the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) accurately after observing \\( z(T) \\) when unsure if the operation \\( h(z) \\) was applied during the period, only from the equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without confirmation of the application of \\( h(z) \\) and merely observing \\( z(T) \\), there is ambiguity since multiple initial conditions could evolve into the same \\( z(T) \\) due to the multiplication by \\( e^{kT} \\). This makes it impossible to ascertain \\( z_0 \\) uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
