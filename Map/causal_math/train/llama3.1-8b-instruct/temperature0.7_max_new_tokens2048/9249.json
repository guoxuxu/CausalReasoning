  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\), with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant real number, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) the initial complex value. We are interested in studying the effect of applying the linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant real number.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves according to \\\\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0\\\\) without any further action, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(T\\\\) be equivalent to \\\\(z(T)\\\\) if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was simply allowed to evolve to \\\\(T\\\\) under \\\\(e^{iAt}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\) modifies the initial condition by the factor \\\\(e^{Bt}\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), changing the trajectory to \\\\(z(t) = e^{(iA + B)t}z_0\\\\). Thus, the resulting state at \\\\(t = T\\\\) will be different due to the composite effect of \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(A\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
