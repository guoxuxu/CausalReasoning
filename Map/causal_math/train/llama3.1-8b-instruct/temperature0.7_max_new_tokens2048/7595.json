  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Analyze the behavior of this system when subjected to a transformation \\\\( T(u) = e^{Mx}u \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being a constant matrix and x representing spatial variables.\n\nIf an intervention using a new transformation \\\\( S(u) = e^{Nx}u \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resulting state \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of another transformation \\\\( S(u) \\\\) introduces additional changes to the system, making the final state \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) dependent on \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and \\\\( L \\\\). Each of these factors influences the evolution and behavior of \\\\( u \\\\) over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
