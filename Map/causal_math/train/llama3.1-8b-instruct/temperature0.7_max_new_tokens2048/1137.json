  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We study the Fourier transform of this function determined by \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ix} e^{-ikx} dx \\).\n\nIf the function is transformed by the Fourier transform without any modifications, will the transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z\\}(k) \\\\) exhibit a delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\) essentially measures the presence of frequencies in the function. Since \\\\( e^{ix} \\\\) is a pure frequency component corresponding to \\\\( k = 1 \\\\), its Fourier transform results in a delta function at \\\\( k = 1 \\\\), indicating the exclusive presence of this frequency with no others.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "imaginary unit i → complex exponential e^(ix); e^(ix) → Fourier transform integral; Fourier transform integral → transform result \\mathcal{F}{z}(k); transform result \\mathcal{F}{z}(k) → delta function at k = 1; imaginary unit i → k = 1"
