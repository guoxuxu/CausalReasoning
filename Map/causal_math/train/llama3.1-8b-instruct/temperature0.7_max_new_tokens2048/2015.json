  "Problem": "Consider the linear integro-differential equation governing a system: \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty g(x, t) y(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) are known functions. We're investigating the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( y(x) \\\\) and then studying the system's behavior under transformations.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a transformational intervention, specifically a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), is applied to the system, will the state \\\\( Y(S, t) \\\\) at \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the initial differential equation without considering \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) adds another layer of complexity. The new transformed state \\\\( Y(S, t) \\\\) will inherently be influenced by both the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform's effects on the system, weaving together influences from both transform conditions as well as the original differential dynamics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
