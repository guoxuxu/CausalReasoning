  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional complex function \\\\( f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,y) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x,y) \\\\) are harmonic functions. The Laplace transform of this function is given as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), and we analyze its impact under the operation \\\\( g(f) = f(z) + w(z) \\\\) where \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is another two-dimensional complex harmonic function.\n\nIf \\\\( g(f) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the Laplace transform without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g(f))(s) \\\\) be the same as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) + \\\\mathcal{L}(w)(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the linear transformation of adding \\\\( w(z) \\\\) to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and subsequently transforming with Laplace yields a linear combination of the transforms. Being linear, the Laplace transform of the sum equals the sum of the Laplace transforms, i.e., \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(z) + w(z)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) + \\\\mathcal{L}(w)(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
