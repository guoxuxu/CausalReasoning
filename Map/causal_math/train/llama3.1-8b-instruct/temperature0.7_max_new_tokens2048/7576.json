  "Problem": "Assume a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), with P being a constant complex number. Consider the Beta transformation defined as \\\\( h(z) = z \\\\cdot e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nCan we precisely determine the sequence and types of applied transformations (including \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\), and their timings) by merely knowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the nature of complex exponential transformations which can overlap and interact in non-trivial ways, it is difficult to back-track from the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to the exact transformations and their application times without additional information. Different sequences and types of transformations could lead to the same or very similar final states, making it impossible to distinguish between them based solely on \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
