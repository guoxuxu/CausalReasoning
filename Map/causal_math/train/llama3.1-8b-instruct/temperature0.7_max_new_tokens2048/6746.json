  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \\\\), used as a transformation within the context of an integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) where \\\\( T[g](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\). The system investigates how transformations affect the Laplace transform of the function over the variable s.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) be exactly identified from \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) at s = 2 without knowing initial transformations and alterations?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( T[g](s) \\\\) encapsulates the function in a transformed state that generally obscures some characteristics of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), such as zero locations or multiplicity unless specific integral properties of the original function are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
