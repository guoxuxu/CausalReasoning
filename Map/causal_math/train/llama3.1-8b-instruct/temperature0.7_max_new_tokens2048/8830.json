  "Problem": "Examine a scenario involving a Laplace transform used on a physical system governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature distribution, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, \\\\( x \\\\) is the position, and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation \\\\( L(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t, x) dt \\\\) is considered.\n\nGiven the function \\\\( L(u(t, x)) \\\\) from the Laplace transform, can one uniquely determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) assuming no intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Although the Laplace transform encodes information about the system's evolution, retrieving \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) solely from \\\\( L(u(t, x)) \\\\) is problematic as information about the initial condition is convoluted with the effects of the heat propagation; reversing the transform does not straightforwardly yield \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
