  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\) describes the time evolution of a complex vector \\\\( w \\\\) under a complex transformation, where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. The effect of an integral transformation characterized by the operator \\\\( T(t) \\\\) which modifies the vector by \\\\( T(t)w = w + itAw \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is calculated at time t = 0 for vector \\\\( w \\\\) and then let to evolve under its own dynamics without any external transformations, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some later time T be affected by \\\\( T(t) \\\\) if it was not applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation \\\\( T(t) \\\\) is not applied, the system evolves purely under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\). The trajectory and the final outcome at time T are determined solely by this function, unaffected by \\\\( T(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
