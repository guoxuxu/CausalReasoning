  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\\\), with \\\\(D\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) being constant matrices, and \\\\(u\\\\) representing control input. We investigate the effect when applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) to the state vector.\n\nIf a new input \\\\( u'(t) = Fv(t) \\\\) (where \\\\(F\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) a new control) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( X(s) \\\\) still yield the same outcomes if \\\\( F \\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) were kept constant originally?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying new control \\\\( u'(t) \\\\) fundamentally alters the system dynamics; thus, \\\\( X(s) \\\\) will reflect different frequency components due to the influence of \\\\( F \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\). The original system's behavior is altered, changing the Fourier transform's outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
