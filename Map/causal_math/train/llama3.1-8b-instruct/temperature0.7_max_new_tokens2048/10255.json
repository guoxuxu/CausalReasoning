  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the Laplace transform \\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\), where \\( p \\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effects of changing \\( p \\) and the impact of convolution with another function \\( g(t) \\) represented by its transform \\( G(s) = e^{-qs} \\), where \\( q \\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\( f(t) \\)'s Laplace transform is convolved with \\( G(s) \\) at some time \\( T \\), resulting in \\( F(s) * G(s) \\), will the resultant transform solely depend on the original \\( p \\) and ignore \\( q \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution in the Laplace domain (multiplication in time domain) of \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\) results in combined effects of the two functions, hence the resultant transform depends on both \\( p \\) and \\( q \\). The value \\( q \\) affects how \\( f(t) \\) is modulated by \\( g(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
