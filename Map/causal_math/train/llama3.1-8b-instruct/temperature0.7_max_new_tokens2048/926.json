  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\( x' = Dx \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. Study the effect of the transformation \\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\) over time t, where L is another diagonalizable matrix and S is the matrix that diagonalizes D.\n\nCan the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at t = 0 be deduced after observing \\( x(t) \\) at t = T without knowledge of whether \\( g(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\( g(x) \\), and given that \\( e^{Lt} \\) could have radically altered the path of \\( x \\), reverse engineering \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(T) \\) is uncertain since \\( L \\) might modify dynamics differently than \\( D \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
