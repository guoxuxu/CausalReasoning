  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) on the solution to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real, positive constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. The impact of transforming the system using \\\\( z(t) x(t) \\\\) is studied over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and then it evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\) without any further intervention, will the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be equivalent to evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = -\\\\lambda x(t) \\\\) till \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) changes the magnitude and phase of \\\\( x_0 \\\\), which leads to a trajectory influenced by the complex term as well. The solution will be different due to these initial modifications imposed by the complex function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
