  "Problem": "Suppose there is a function \\\\(z(x, t)\\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + x \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\) where x represents space and t represents time. An intervention \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) is defined as \\\\(z(x, t) = u(x, t) + v(x, t)\\\\), with \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\) being solutions to another set of PDEs.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\(z(x, 0) = u(x, 0) + v(x, 0)\\\\) is given, and the function evolves over time according to the specified PDE without added interventions, will the outcome at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) solely depend on the initial conditions set by \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, 0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution to the linear PDE depends directly on the initial conditions, and since no additional terms or interventions modify these conditions, the output at any time \\\\(t = T\\\\) can be predicted solely based on the initial values provided by \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and \\\\(v(x, 0)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
