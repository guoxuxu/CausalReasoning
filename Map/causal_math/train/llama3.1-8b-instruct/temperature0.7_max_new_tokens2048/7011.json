  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the voltage across a capacitor is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\\\frac{1}{C}I\\\\), where R is resistance, C is capacitance, and I is current. Evaluate the impact of a sudden change in current input described by a Heaviside step function \\\\( I(t) = I_0u(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is the Heaviside function and \\\\( I_0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at time t = 0 the current changes abruptly and at a different, later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an intervention changes the resistance to R', will the steady-state voltage V(T) for T > t_1 depend on both initial and altered resistance values?",
  "Explanation": "The final steady-state voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) will indeed rely on the initial resistance R and altered resistance R'. The change in resistance affects the time constant \\\\( \\\\tau = RC \\\\) and ultimately the charge-discharge cycle, directly influencing the steady-state voltage value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
