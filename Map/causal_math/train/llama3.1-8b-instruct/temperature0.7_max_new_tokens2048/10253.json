  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by the Laplace transform \\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s-p} \\), where \\( p \\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effects of changing \\( p \\) and the impact of convolution with another function \\( g(t) \\) represented by its transform \\( G(s) = e^{-qs} \\), where \\( q \\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf \\( p \\) is altered to \\( p + \\\\delta \\) where \\( \\\\delta \\) is a small complex number, and \\( F(s) \\) is evolved naturally without further changes, will the inverse transform \\( f(t) \\) at a later time display the same behavior as the original \\( f(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The shift in \\( p \\) to \\( p + \\\\delta \\) alters the pole of the Laplace transform, modifying the decay or growth characteristics and oscillation frequency of the function \\( f(t) \\). Thus, the time-domain behavior of \\( f(t) \\) will fundamentally change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
