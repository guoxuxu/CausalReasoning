  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) representing a sinusoidal signal in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant angular frequency. We analyze the effect of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\\\), and how it maps the function into a complex frequency domain.\n\nCan we determine whether there was an intervention in the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) merely by inspecting the final Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "If the Laplace transform deviates from \\\\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\\\), it indicates a modification to the original frequency. The transform’s denominator \\\\( s - i(\\omega + \\delta) \\\\) directly reflects the intervened frequency, allowing detection of changes from the original signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
