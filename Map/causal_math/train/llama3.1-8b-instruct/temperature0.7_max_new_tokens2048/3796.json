  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation using the matrix \\\\( L \\\\), which operates in the complex function space by multiplying with the matrix \\\\( e^{i\\omega} \\\\), an operator associated with frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\. The system is analyzed for function \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nKnowing only the form of \\\\( h(Z) \\\\) at the endpoint, can we accurately determine what transformations were applied (both the initial \\\\( L \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( M \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complexity and non-linear superposition of the transformations in the complex function space, it is challenging to reverse engineer exactly which transformations were applied based only on the final state. Multiple different parameters for \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\) could result in the same endpoint, obscuring the identification of specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
