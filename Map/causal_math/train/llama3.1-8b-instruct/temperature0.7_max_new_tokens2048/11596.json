  "Problem": "Analyze the interaction between a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Mv \\\\) and a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(v) \\\\) applied to vector \\\\( v \\\\) in Euclidean space. Matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is constant, and the Fourier transform operates on function space representations of \\\\( v \\\\).\n\nIf the final vector after these transformations and interventions is known, can we determine the specific matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and filter \\\\( h(v) \\\\) used?",
  "Explanation": "The final state, having undergone possibly non-linear and non-invertible transformations, masks the specifics of the interventions. Identifying the exact matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and the filter \\\\( h(v) \\\\) solely from the end result is typically unfeasible without additional information, due to the convolutional and overlapping effects introduced by both the Fourier transform and filtering.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
