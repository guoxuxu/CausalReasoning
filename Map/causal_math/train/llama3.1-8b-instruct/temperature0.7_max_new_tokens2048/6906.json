  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the particle movement on a plane is determined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts of the particle's position at time t, respectively. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) is used to analyze the frequency components of the motion.\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) obtained from the Fourier transform, can one uniquely determine the precise function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) assuming no interventions were made?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform provides the frequency components but loses certain phase information and cannot distinguish between different functions that might have the same frequency components differing by phase shifts. Hence, we cannot uniquely identify \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
