  "Problem": "Consider the eigenvalue problem associated with the linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acting on a function space. The operator is defined by the differential equation \\\\(L[u] = -y'' + q(x)y \\\\) on the interval \\\\([0, 1]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(y(0) = y(1) = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q(x)\\\\) is a potential function.\n\nIf the potential function \\\\(q(x)\\\\) is altered to a different \\\\(q'(x)\\\\) at the outset, will the eigenvalues \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) associated with \\\\(L[u]\\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the potential function modifies the differential operator, thus affecting the resulting eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are sensitive to changes in the potential term, reflecting alterations in the operator's spectrum.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
