  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\( u(x, t) \\) solving the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\), where \\( u_t \\) is the time derivative and \\( \\Delta u \\) is the Laplacian. We are interested in analyzing the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x, t) \\) and its impact over time.\n\nGiven the end state \\( u(x, T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( F(u) \\), \\( G(u) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( u(x, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used (i.e., \\( F(u) \\) or \\( G(u) \\) or both) based solely on observing the final state \\( u(x, T) \\) is challenging due to the potential overlapping effects of these transformations on the heat equation dynamics. These transformations can result in equivalent states through different paths, creating ambiguity in back-tracing the specific interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
