  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where the initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) undergoes transformations described by multiplication with matrices. We analyze the sequence where \\\\(x_0\\\\) is first multiplied by matrix \\\\(P\\\\) and then matrix \\\\(Q\\\\) over period t, expressed as \\\\(x(t) = QP x_0\\\\). A new transformation matrix \\\\(R\\\\) can be used as an intervention.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), matrix \\\\(R\\\\) is applied as an intervention to \\\\(x_1 = QP x_0\\\\), will the resulting vector \\\\(x(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on \\\\(QP\\\\) and not on \\\\(R\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with matrix \\\\(R\\\\) modifies the sequence, making the final state \\\\(x(T) = R x_1 = RQP x_0\\\\) for T > t_1 dependent not only on \\\\(QP\\\\) but also on \\\\(R\\\\). The transformation by \\\\(R\\\\) adds a layer of alteration that affects the final outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
