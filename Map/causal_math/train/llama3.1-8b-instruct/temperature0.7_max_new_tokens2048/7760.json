  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transformation applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) described as \\\\( F(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) dt \\\\). We analyze the impact of the modification where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is initially multiplied by a squared modulus of another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), initiating as \\\\( g(t) = |h(t)|^2 f(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform.\n\nGiven the resultant spectrum \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) after applying filters and transformations, can we determine which function and modifications were applied (\\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( alpha \\\\), or both), solely based on \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant spectrum \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) may not uniquely identify the exact interventions due to potential overlaps in spectral characteristics induced by different functions and filtering parameters. Identifying the precise modifications requires additional information beyond the spectrum itself.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
