  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where N is also a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{Qt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) (where Q is another constant complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the new integral transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) introduces additional dependencies on the matrices N and Q. The ultimate state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by how these transformations (associated with N and Q) interact with the ongoing dynamics dictated by M, potentially causing a significantly altered endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
