  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\\\) where A is a matrix and v is a complex constant vector. The system is then subjected to a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nBased on the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the specific intervention (e.g., whether \\\\( G(z) \\\\) or another function was applied), without additional information about the time sequence or matrix parameters (A, C)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the mathematical complexity and the overlapping influences of matrix exponentials in both \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and potential intervention functions like \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine the nature of interventions purely from the Fourier transform output without more specifics on the matrix parameters and the intervention timeline.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
