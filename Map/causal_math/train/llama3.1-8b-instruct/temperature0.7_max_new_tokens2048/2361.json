  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a time-dependent state in a system. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) is applied to the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve following the original definition of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without further interventions, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the state evolved naturally from t = 0 to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system by integrating the past states, thus affecting the subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This results in a different state at time T from just evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) dictates the rate of change and phase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
