  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We explore the behavior of this function under the Laplace transform and its inverse, especially when analyzing causality both ways between input and output functions.\n\nCan we determine the point of intervention (introduction of matrix \\\\( B \\\\)) by analyzing changes in the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( L\\\\{z'(x)\\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although changes in the system's behavior can be detected by examining the inverse Laplace transform of the output, precisely pinpointing the time and nature of the intervention (matrix \\\\( B \\\\)) is challenging without prior knowledge of the system's states before and after the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
