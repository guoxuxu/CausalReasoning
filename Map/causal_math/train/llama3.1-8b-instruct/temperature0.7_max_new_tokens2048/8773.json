  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a particle's position in the complex plane. Assume the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An integral transform \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\) is considered to analyze the system at different instances.\n\nIf no intervention is applied and the function \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is calculated for an input state \\\\(z_0\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), will the transformed state \\\\(f(z)(T)\\\\) adhere to the same differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transform \\\\(f(z)\\\\) aggregates the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time, which results in an integrated state that does not necessarily conform to the original differential growth model due to the accumulated history of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
