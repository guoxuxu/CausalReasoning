  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) = X(s)\\\\), where x(t) is the input signal and X(s) represents the transformed signal in the s-domain. We examine the effect of modifications to the system's behavior through convolution with a kernel h(t) resulting in a new output y(t) given by \\\\(y(t) = (h * x)(t)\\\\).\n\nIf at time t1 a filtering operation specified by another kernel g(t) modifies y(t) to produce z(t), will the final outcome Z(s) depend solely on h(t) and not on g(t) or x(t)?",
  "Explanation": "The filtering with g(t) acts as an additional transformation, implying the final Z(s) will depend on G(s), H(s), and X(s), where G(s) is the Laplace Transform of g(t). The final outcome is derived using Y(s) and G(s), resulting in Z(s) = G(s)Y(s) = G(s)H(s)X(s), hence dependent on all three components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
