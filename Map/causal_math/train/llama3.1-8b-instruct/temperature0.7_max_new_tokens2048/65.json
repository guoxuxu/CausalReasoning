  "Problem": "Consider a differential equation governing heat distribution \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), with initial heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\). An operation \\\\(g(u) = e^{wt}u\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(w\\) is a constant, which alters the heat distribution dynamically.\n\nIf \\\\(g(u)\\\\) is applied to the initial function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) at time t=0, and the system is then left to evolve under \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\) without further intervention, will the heat distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at time T differ from the evolution of \\\\(f(x)\\\\) without the application of \\\\(g(u)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(g(u) = e^{wt}u\\\\) scales the initial heat distribution, changing the initial conditions of the equation. As the heat equation solution depends sensitively on initial conditions, the heat distribution at any subsequent time, including T, will differ.",
