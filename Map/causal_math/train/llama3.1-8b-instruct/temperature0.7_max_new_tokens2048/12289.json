  "Problem": "Examine the causal relationship in a scenario where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes various transformations. Initially, we have a Fourier transform applied to the signal, \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) dt \\\\). Afterwards, we evaluate the impact using a filter function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), which might be an intervention in the frequency domain.\n\nCan the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) be uniquely determined after observing its frequency response \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) \\\\) without external alterations?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the signal and transformation meet the conditions required for the inverse Fourier transform to exist (such as the signal being absolutely integrable), the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) can generally be perfectly reconstructed from \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) \\\\) using the inverse Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
