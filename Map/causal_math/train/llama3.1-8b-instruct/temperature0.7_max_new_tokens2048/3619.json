  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that satisfies the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k > 0 \\\\) is a constant. Analyses include transforming the function via \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t}u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( h(u) = e^{\\\\mu t}u \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the final form of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined only by the initial heat equation parameter \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing the transformation \\\\( h(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) affects the evolution of \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) independently from the initial transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\), adding another layer of complexity dependent on both \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\). Thus, the endpoint \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) will depend on \\\\( k, \\\\lambda, \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
