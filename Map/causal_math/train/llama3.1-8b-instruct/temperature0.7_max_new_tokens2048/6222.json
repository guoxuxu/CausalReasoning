  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) are constants in complex form. We explore the impact of applying the Laplace transform and its inverse on function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), interpreted over varying scenarios.\n\nHaving observed the output of the inverse Laplace transform over time, can the original differential equation parameters \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) be unequivocally determined?",
  "Explanation": "While the overall function form can be determined, specific parameters \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) defining the dynamic behavior in the differential equation can be ambiguously reconstructed due to potential similarities in system dynamics driven by different parameter values but producing indistinguishable resultant functions under linear operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
