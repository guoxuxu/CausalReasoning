  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), applied to complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representable by a series of sinusoids. The analysis explores the effects of modifying the function through an additive constant term, represented by \\\\( g(z) = z(t) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the transformed output \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\), is it possible to determine what the specific intervention \\\\( c \\\\) was and what the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was, with certainty?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the modified function \\\\( f(g(z)) \\\\) equals \\\\( f(z) + c/s \\\\), and multiple combinations of \\\\( c \\\\) and original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can yield the same transformed outcome due to the linear properties of the Laplace transform, making unique identification of both impossible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
