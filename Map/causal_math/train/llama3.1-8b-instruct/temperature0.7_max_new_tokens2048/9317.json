  "Problem": "Consider a linear system of equations represented by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a vector. We explore the influence of a transformation defined by the function \\\\(f(x) = Mx\\\\), where M is an invertible matrix, on the solution x.\n\nIf \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is applied to a solution vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) that satisfies \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) and then \\\\(x\\\\) is allowed to evolve under the equation \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) without further intervention, will the resulting \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at any t be a solution to \\\\(Ax = b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Application of \\\\(f(x)\\\\) results in \\\\(Mx_0\\\\), and since M is invertible and \\\\(Ax_0 = b\\\\), multiplying by M does not alter the fact that \\\\(Ax = b\\\\) is still valid due to the properties of matrix equations, meaning the transformed vector remains a solution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
