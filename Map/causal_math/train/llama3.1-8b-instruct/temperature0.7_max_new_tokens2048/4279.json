  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit with a resistor R and an inductor L in series, governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(V(t)\\\\) denotes the applied voltage. We introduce a transformation \\\\(g(I) = I + ct\\\\), where c is a constant, applied to the current I at time t.\n\nIf an additional voltage source \\\\(V'(t) = kt\\\\), where k is a constant, is added at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) as an intervention, will the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) only depend on the parameters R and L and not on the functions g or the added voltage term k?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with an additional linearly increasing voltage source introduces another modifying factor to the original system equation. This additional term affects the differential equation's solution from time \\\\(t_1\\\\) onwards, making the final current \\\\(I(T)\\\\) dependent on the terms associated with \\\\(g(I)\\\\), R, L, as well as the parameters k and t.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
