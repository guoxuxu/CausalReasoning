  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the effect of applying an integral transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(\\\\alpha + i\\\\beta)u} z(u) du \\\\) with constants \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\).\n\nIf an intervening transformation is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), using a new integral transform \\\\( S(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{(\\\\gamma + i\\\\delta)u} z(u) du \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\gamma, \\\\delta \\\\) are constants), will the final output \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T depend only on the original differential equation and not on the effects of \\\\( S(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a new transformation with \\\\( S(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds a new layer of complexity: the function's history up to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) is modified by one exponential weighting, and the subsequent behavior is influenced by the continuation under the original transform's parameters. Thus, \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is affected by both \\\\( S(z) \\\\) and the original equation dynamics, making the end result depend on both transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
