  "Problem": "Imagine a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. Consider the application of a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another complex constant, to investigate integral transformations and their effects.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to unequivocally identify the specific transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) applied during the evolution, by solely analyzing the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may result from various permutations and combinations of transformations due to the exponential nature of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and their non-commutative interactions. Multiple transformation sequences can lead to the same final state, obscuring the causal sequence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
