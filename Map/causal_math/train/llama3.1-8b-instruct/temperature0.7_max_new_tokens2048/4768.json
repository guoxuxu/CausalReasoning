  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function space such that \\\\( L \\\\) represents a Fourier Transformation, and we investigate the impact of an additional operator \\\\( M \\\\) which applies a convolution transformation with a fixed kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final transformation result of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (either \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\), or \\\\( N \\\\) or combinations thereof), and in what order, by only knowing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The potential for overlap in effects due to the convolutions and Fourier transformation, and their dependency on the initial function and each other's subsequent applications, makes it impossible to precisely and uniquely identify the transformations and their order from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
