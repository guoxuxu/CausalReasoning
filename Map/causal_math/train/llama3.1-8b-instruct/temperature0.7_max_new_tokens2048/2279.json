  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the integral transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is the Laplace transform. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( e^{-2t} \\\\) and influences the system through the convolution \\\\( y(t) = (f * x)(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input signal.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( e^{5t} \\\\), will the final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the Laplace transform of \\\\( f \\\\) and not on the history of \\\\( x \\\\) leading up to the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) will still be influenced by the values of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) prior to \\\\( t_1 \\\\), due to the convolution integral between \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\) that incorporates historical values of \\\\( x \\\\). The Laplace transform of \\\\( f \\\\) does not negate this dependency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
