  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time based on the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a real constant. The function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iDt}z \\\\) where \\\\( D \\\\) is another real constant, represents a transformation applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, and given that such a transformation influences the trajectory in a non-trivial way (especially its phase), it is impossible to uniquely back-calculate the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without that information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
