  "Problem": "Consider the interaction between two functions defined over scalar fields, \\\\( u(z) = e^{az} \\\\) and \\\\( v(z) = e^{bz} \\\\), where a and b are constants, in the context of an integro-differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dz} \\\\left( h(z) \\\\right) = \\\\int_0^z u(\\\\tau) v(z - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nSuppose an intervention modifies \\\\( v(z) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\tilde{v}(z) = v(z) + cz \\\\) where c is a constant, after some \\\\( z_0 > 0 \\\\). Will the new solution \\\\( \\\\tilde{h}(z) \\\\) for \\\\( z > z_0 \\\\) still reflect the original parameters a and b?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function \\\\( v(z) \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\tilde{v}(z) \\\\), thereby altering the convolution integral defining \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The modified integral, and consequently \\\\( \\\\tilde{h}(z) \\\\), will now depend not only on a and b but also significantly on the additional parameter c introduced into the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
