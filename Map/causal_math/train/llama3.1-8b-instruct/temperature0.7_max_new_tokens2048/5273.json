  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\(h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt\\\\) where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + Nu\\\\), with constant matrices M and N and control input \\\\(u(t)\\\\). We explore how this integral transformation affects causal inference in different scenario contexts.\n\nWill the transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) be solely determined by the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\) if no input \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is applied throughout the evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without an external input \\\\(u(t)\\\\), the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is solely determined by the matrix M and the initial condition \\\\(z_0\\\\). However, \\\\(h(z)\\\\) as an integral transformation incorporates all the evolutionary effects over time, and solely knowing the initial condition is insufficient to determine the effect solely as the matrix M influences the progression over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
