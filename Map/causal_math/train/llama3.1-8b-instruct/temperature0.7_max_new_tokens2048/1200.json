  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{−λt}(x + iy) \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are real numbers, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\\\( λ \\\\) is a complex constant. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is analyzed under the application of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, and time evolution t.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we explicitly determine the exact form of the interventions (whether \\\\( L(z) \\\\), \\\\( M(z) \\\\), or both) applied by solely knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be achieved from various combinations of parameters of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) and their timings due to the overlapping contributing elements in the complex plane. The presence of exponential decay and the addition of variables introduced by these operators make it impossible to distinctively backtrack the exact interventions used without additional clarifying information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
