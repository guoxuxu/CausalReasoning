  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), applied to complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) representable by a series of sinusoids. The analysis explores the effects of modifying the function through an additive constant term, represented by \\\\( g(z) = z(t) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf you transform \\\\( z(t) \\\\) using \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and then allow the resultant function to be used in further calculations in its own right, will this resultant behavior be equivalent to that of just using \\\\( z(t) \\\\) directly in those calculations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) represents the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), simplifying or altering the information content from the original function. Properties and specific behaviors of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), especially time-domain characteristics, are not maintained identically after the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
