  "Problem": "Consider the equation governing the heat conduction in a rod described by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature distribution, \\\\( t \\\\) is time, and \\\\( x \\\\) is the spatial variable. Assume the rod is initially at rest with a temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) and that k is a constant.\n\nIf during the evolution, at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention is made by altering the temperature profile with a different function \\\\( j(x) \\\\) (changing the boundary conditions or adding heat sources/sinks), will the original heat equation still govern the entire process and the temperature at any later time T still only depend on the initial function \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the effective boundary conditions or adds new components to the system (like sources/sinks), which introduces additional terms in the heat equation. Therefore, the subsequent evolution of the temperature distribution depends not only on \\\\( h(x) \\\\) but also on the nature and timing of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
