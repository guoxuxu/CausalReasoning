  "Problem": "We have a LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) system characterized by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Lx(t) = y(t) \\\\). In addition, we consider the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its inverse transformation applied to \\\\( X(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an interpolation function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied as an intervention after \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is reconstructed from \\\\( X(s) \\\\), will the resultant \\\\( y(t) = L(h(t) * x(t)) \\\\) (where * denotes convolution) still depend only on the original operator \\\\( L \\\\), and not on the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by convolution, creating a new function upon which \\\\( L \\\\) acts. The resulting output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) depends not just on \\\\( L \\\\), but also significantly on the choice of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), which alters the system's input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
