  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), which modifies its spectral components.\n\nCan we precisely determine what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or both), by analyzing the system's state at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations solely from the state at \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) is not possible due to the overlapping effects of different matrix exponentiations and their non-trivial impact on the system's trajectory in both time and frequency domains. Multiple combinations of transformations can lead to similar or indistinguishable outcomes at time \\\\( t \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
