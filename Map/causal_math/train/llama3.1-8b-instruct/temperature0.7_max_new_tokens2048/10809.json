  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by complex function theory, where \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), and \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a given function. Assess how transformations by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) which acts on \\\\( f(x) \\\\) as \\\\( L[f(x)] = f(ax+b) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants, affect the outcome in terms of the causality and intervention.\n\nIf initially the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is transformed by applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and then observing the transformed integral \\\\( z(w) \\\\), will the result be the same as if \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was not transformed and directly used in the integral?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) modifies the function to \\\\( f(ax+b) \\\\), which will affect the result of the integral since the exponential term in the integral and the stretching/scaling induced by \\\\( a \\\\) and shifting by \\\\( b \\\\) alter how the function interacts with \\\\( e^{iwx} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
