  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), commonly referred to as the heat equation. An integral transform, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) = U(k, t) \\\\), is applied to the system.\n\nGiven \\\\( U(k, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) by inverting the Fourier transform if no other interventions were made?",
  "Explanation": "Because the Fourier transform and the evolution according to the heat equation are reversible processes in this quadratic, linear setting, and assuming ideal conditions without loss of information, it is feasible to recover the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform to \\\\( U(k, T) \\\\) followed by using the inverse solution of the heat equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
