  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. Investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) and then studying its behavior under this transformation.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) without any intervention, will the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,T) \\\\) at time T be equivalent to the Fourier transform of the solution had \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) been directly evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform changes the basis from spatial to frequency domain, and the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) might behave differently in this domain. This behavior can distinctly alter how the transformed initial conditions evolve, resulting in a different solution.",
