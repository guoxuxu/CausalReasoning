  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We investigate the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( S(z) = cz + d \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and not on \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( S \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces new parameters that influence the function beyond just the transformation \\\\( T \\\\). The resultant trajectory is a combination of both transformations, leading to a final state that depends on both \\\\( a, b \\\\) and \\\\( c, d \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
