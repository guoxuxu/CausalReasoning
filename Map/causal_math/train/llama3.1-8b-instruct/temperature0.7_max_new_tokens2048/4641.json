  "Problem": "Consider a complex function f(z) described by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We examine the scenario where the Laplace transform, defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), is applied to explore the integral transformations over the complex function f.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) is calculated without further manipulation to the function f(z), will the result at a specific s reflect the natural behavior of the function e^{z^2} over time?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of f(z) introduces a transformation that extends to the complex domain and alters the evolution of f(z) represented in the s-domain. This transformation typically distorts insights into natural time-domain behaviors of the function \\\\( e^{z^2} \\\\), as it filters and modifies the behavior through the exponential decay factor \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
