  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) defined on the complex plane. We evaluate the responses to integrations involving the complex function and the related impacts given by the transform \\\\( g(z) = e^{2\\\\pi iz} \\\\).\n\nAssuming that at a time \\\\( t_0.5 \\\\) an intervention applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is made to the output of \\\\( f(z_0) \\\\), will the resultant function at t = 1 not involve the effects of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after \\\\( f(z) \\\\) adds a complex plane rotation to the squared magnitude and altered phase, meaning the final output is a result of both the initial squaring and the subsequent application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), reflecting both functions' impacts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
