  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The system is further studied under the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another constant.\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) with unknown application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), can we determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was employed, without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or confirming the application of the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it's impossible to distinguish if the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from the natural progression under \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) or modified dynamics due to \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). The transform could fundamentally alter the trajectory and final characteristics of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), masking the effects solely attributed to \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
