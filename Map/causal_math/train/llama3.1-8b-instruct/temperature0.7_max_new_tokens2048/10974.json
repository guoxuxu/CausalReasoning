  "Problem": "Consider the effect of a Fourier Transform on a given function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant. The Fourier Transform of this function is defined as \\\\( G(f) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-at^2} e^{-i2\\\\pi ft} dt \\\\). Analyze the outcomes of various implementation scenarios and their reverse causality.\n\nCan we deduce the exact functional form of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) knowing only \\\\( G(f) \\\\) without additional transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform, particularly for well-behaved functions like Gaussian-type functions, is bijective in nature. This means that knowing \\\\( G(f) \\\\) allows for the unique determination of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) through the inverse Fourier Transform under standard conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a > 0 → g(t) exists; e^{-at^2} → G(f); G(f) → Fourier Transform; Fourier Transform → g(t); g(t) → G(f); G(f) → a; a → e^{-at^2}"
