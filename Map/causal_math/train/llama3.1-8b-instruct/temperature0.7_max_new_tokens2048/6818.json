  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which converts the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) into its frequency components \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) was applied during evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether a transformation occurred, the exact initial state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) that led to \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) is ambiguous. The transformation could alter the frequencies and phase of the solution, making it impossible to retrieve the original function unambiguously.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
