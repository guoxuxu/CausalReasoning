  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time in a dynamic system modeled by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{kt}z \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a starting complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) naturally, will the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time t > 0 be equivalent to what it would have been by direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the initial value of the state from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{k \\\\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), but as time progresses, the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) includes the effect of \\\\( k \\\\) due to the multiplicative factor \\\\( e^{kt} \\\\), which changes the trajectory compared to the natural evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
