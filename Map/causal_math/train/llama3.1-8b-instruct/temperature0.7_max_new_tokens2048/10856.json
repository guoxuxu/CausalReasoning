  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We explore the integration transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ct'} z(t') \\\\, dt' \\\\) with constant matrix C over time t, and how this affects system behavior.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used (whether \\\\( F(z) \\\\), \\\\( G(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations through \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and \\\\( G(z) \\\\) may significantly overlap in their effects due to the integrating properties and dependencies on C and D, respectively. This multiplicative interaction and potential overlap in their impacts make it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
