  "Problem": "Consider a magnetic field \\\\( \\\\vec{B} = B_0 e^{-kt} \\\\hat{z} \\\\), acting on a charged particle resulting in the Lorentz force equation \\\\( \\\\dot{\\\\vec{v}} = q (\\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{B}) \\\\). We explore the effects of an applied electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} = E_0 \\\\hat{x} \\\\) as a transformation on the particle's motion.\n\nCan the original state of the particle's motion be deduced accurately at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing its trajectory at time \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing whether the electric field \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( \\\\vec{E} \\\\), the trajectory observed at \\\\( T \\\\) could result from different initial conditions, especially since the electric field introduces significant changes in initial velocity and subsequent motions due to its non-conservative nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
