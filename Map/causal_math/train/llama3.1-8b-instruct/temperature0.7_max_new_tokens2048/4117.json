  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the temperature distribution \\\\(T(x,t)\\\\) along a rod evolves according to the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where k is the thermal diffusivity. We analyze the effect of an intervention defined by a change in boundary conditions from \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0\\\\) (a constant temperature) to an impulse response \\\\(T(0, t) = T_0 + \\\\delta(t)\\\\) at a specific time.\n\nIf the boundary condition at \\\\(x=0\\\\) remains constant at \\\\(T_0\\\\) without any intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(T(L, t)\\\\) at the other end of the rod \\\\(x=L\\\\) be solely influenced by the initial condition \\\\(T(x,0)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of any intervention, the temperature distribution at any point, including the end of the rod, is entirely determined by the heat equation and the initial/boundary conditions. No additional factors influence the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
