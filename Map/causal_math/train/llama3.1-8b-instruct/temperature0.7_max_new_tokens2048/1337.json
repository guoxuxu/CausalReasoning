  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature distribution along a rod, and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate the effects of an initial heat distribution function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) and a later heat source intervention represented by \\\\(s(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf the initial heat distribution \\\\(u(x, 0) = h(x)\\\\) is set, and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\) without any additional heat source, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for some time T be solely dependent on the initial function \\\\(h(x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution of the temperature distribution in the heat equation without external influence solely depends on the initial conditions due to the deterministic nature of the heat equation. The future state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) is derived entirely from the initial function \\\\(h(x)\\\\) through the equation's inherent propagation characteristics.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
