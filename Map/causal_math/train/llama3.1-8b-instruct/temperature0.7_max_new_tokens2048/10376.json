  "Problem": "We consider a system where the current at any time t in an electrical circuit is determined by the integral transformation \\\\( I(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t - \\\\tau)}V(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( V(t) \\\\) represents the voltage source function. We also consider a time-dependent change in resistance modeled by the function \\\\( R(t) = 1 + \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) affecting the voltage source.\n\nGiven the observed current \\\\( I(T) \\\\) and knowledge that either resistance stabilization or another form of intervention might have occurred, can we accurately deduce whether any intervention took place and what its nature was?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple interventions could produce similar current outcomes, especially given the complex relationship between voltage, resistance, and their interaction. Without explicit information about the nature and timing of interventions, many scenarios could yield the same current \\\\( I(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
