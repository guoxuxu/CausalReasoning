  "Problem": "Consider a time-varying complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We look at the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) as a delta function centred at some constant \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\), can it be deduced that the original function was \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) without knowing the initial form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a delta function in \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) precisely indicates that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was a pure exponential function of the form \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\). This specific transformation feature allows exact determination of the cause from the effect in the domain of Fourier analysis of simple exponential signals.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
