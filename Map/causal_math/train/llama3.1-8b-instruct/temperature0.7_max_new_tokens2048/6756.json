  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, is examined over time.\n\nCan the exact sequence and kinds of interventions (like \\\\( M[z] \\\\) or changes in \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) be identified solely based on the observed value \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) at the end of the time T?",
  "Explanation": "Given the smoothing and information loss due to integration, and the possible interference of multiple factors such as decay rate (\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)) and scaling (by \\\\( M[z] \\\\)), multiple combinations can yield similar or indistinguishable outcomes in \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), precluding exact back-analysis of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
