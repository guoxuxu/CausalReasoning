  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The complex function transformations involve \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices operating in the complex domain over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) initially transforms \\\\( z_0 \\\\), potentially modifying its magnitude and phase. This initial alteration affects how the function evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), leading to a different complex number at time T than if we had simply evolved \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
