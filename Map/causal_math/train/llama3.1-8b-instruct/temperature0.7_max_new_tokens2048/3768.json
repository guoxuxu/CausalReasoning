  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the charge \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) on a capacitor evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{Q} = -\\\\frac{Q}{RC} + I(t) \\\\), where R is resistance, C is capacitance, and \\\\( I(t) \\\\) is an external current source. We examine the impact of modifying the circuit by changing the resistance to a new value \\\\( R' \\\\) at time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( Q(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (the change in resistance, the current pulse parameters, or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( Q(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final charge \\\\( Q(T) \\\\) can result from different combinations of resistance value changes and different parameters of the current pulse. Without more detailed knowledge about timing or the nature of interventions, it is impossible to uniquely determine the interventions from \\\\( Q(T) \\\\) alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
