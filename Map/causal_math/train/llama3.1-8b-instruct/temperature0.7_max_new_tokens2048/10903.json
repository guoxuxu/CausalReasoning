  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex number. We are exploring how the function transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) impacts z over time t, where Q is another complex number.\n\nIf a function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is another complex number) is applied as an intervention at a certain time t_1, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on P and not on Q or R?",
  "Explanation": "The use of additional transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) as an intervention at time t_1 means that multiple exponential factors (related to Q and R) will affect the trajectory and the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making it dependent on all parameters P, Q, and R.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
