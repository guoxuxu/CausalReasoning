  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + v\\\\cdot\\\\nabla u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u(t,x)\\\\) represents the state of the system and \\\\(v\\\\) is a constant velocity vector. The impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) applied to the initial condition \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) is studied to determine its effect over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\), is it possible to determine definitively whether the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform, or both were applied as interventions solely from \\\\(u(T,x)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations affect state evolution in complex and significantly different ways making it challenging to reverse engineer uniquely from the final state back to the interventions. The overlapping influences and potential equivalent states from different interventions complicate such determinations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
