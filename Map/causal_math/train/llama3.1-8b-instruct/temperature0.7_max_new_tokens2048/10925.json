  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation through a Laplace Transform given by \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = F(s) \\\\). The impact of manipulating \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) (a complex number in the Laplace Transform) on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is studied.\n\nIf \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is increased, and \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is computed without further intervention, will the convergence region of the Laplace Transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) change?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing \\\\( \\omega \\\\) affects the oscillatory component of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which changes the behavior in the frequency domain. The convergence of the Laplace Transform is dependent on the real part of \\\\( s \\\\) relative to \\\\( \\omega \\\\), hence the region of convergence will shift, reflecting this change in frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
