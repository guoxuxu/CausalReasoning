  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where heat conduction through a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature at position \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the temperature at a particular point according to the function \\\\(h(x, t) = e^{−at}sin(bx)\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf an intervention applying a different function \\\\(j(x, t) = e^{−ct}cos(dx)\\\\) (where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\) are constants) is applied at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the final temperature profile \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) reflect influence primarily from \\\\(k\\\\) and not significantly from \\\\(a, b, c,\\\\) or \\\\(d\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\(j(x, t)\\\\) adds another complexity to the temperature profile. While the diffusion term \\\\(ku_{xx}\\\\) continuously works to smooth out temperature gradients, the specifics of the final temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) depend significantly on the interaction of the initial and intervening functions, so influences from all constants \\\\(k, a, b, c,\\\\) and \\\\(d\\\\) are essential.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
