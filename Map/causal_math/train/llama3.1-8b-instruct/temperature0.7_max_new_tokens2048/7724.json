  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int e^{At} f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is a scalar function. This setup explores how changes in \\\\( A \\\\) or \\\\( f \\\\) influence the behavior of \\\\( u(t) \\\\).\n\nConsidering the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at some final time \\\\( T \\\\), can we ascertain whether an intervention on \\\\( f(s) \\\\), such as changing it to \\\\( g(s) \\\\), occurred, strictly based on the output at time \\\\( T \\\\) without prior knowledge of the timeline of any interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( u(T) \\\\) could result from different historical configurations and interventions without clear distinctions in the output form at \\\\( T \\\\). Therefore, without explicit intervention timelines or functional forms of \\\\( f(s) \\\\) and \\\\( g(s) \\\\), the occurrence and type of intervention cannot be definitely concluded from the observation at \\\\( T \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
