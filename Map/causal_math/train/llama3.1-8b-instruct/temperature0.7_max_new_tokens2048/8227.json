  "Problem": "Investigate the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}w \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where A and B are complex constant matrices, considering the integral transformations over a time interval [0, T].\n\nAssuming another transformation \\\\( q(t) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is intervened at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final expression of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely rely on the effects of A?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an intervention \\\\( q(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds a layer of complexity involving matrix C, thereby making the trajectory and the final state at time T dependent not only on A but also on the effects introduced by C and the previous effects of B. The transformations compose non-trivially, influencing the entire evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
