  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapping from time \\\\( t \\\\) in the complex plane to a complex number \\\\( z \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to process the output at different times.\n\nCan we determine the exact state at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) after observing the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the initial application of \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), it cannot be determined if the observed state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) resulted from an altered or unaltered initial state, especially given that the transformation could fundamentally change the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
