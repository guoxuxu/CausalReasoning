  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(t\\\\) is time, \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state vector of the system. We analyze how the integral transformation \\\\(X(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, influences the state over time.\n\nIf an operational change alters \\\\(C\\\\) to a different matrix \\\\(D\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), hence altering the trajectory to \\\\(z(t) = De^{A(t-t_1)}z(t_1)\\\\), will \\\\(X(T)\\\\), for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), solely depend on \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in matrix from \\\\(C\\\\) to \\\\(D\\\\) introduces another vector of influence altering both the instantaneous and accumulated state of \\\\(z(t)\\\\). Therefore, \\\\(X(T)\\\\) will reflect the contributions of \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), and the change induced by \\\\(D\\\\), not just \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
