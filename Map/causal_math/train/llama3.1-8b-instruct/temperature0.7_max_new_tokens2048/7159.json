  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) which represents the Laplace transform of the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) applicable over the domain of complex numbers for \\\\( z \\\\). The system's behavior is analyzed by varying the complex variable \\\\( z \\\\) and examining the function \\\\( g(z) = z^2u(z) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{az} \\\\) is applied as an intervention where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant, will the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) for any \\\\( z \\\\) still only be influenced by the original \\\\( z^2 \\\\) manipulation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new factor that modifies the nature of the Laplace transform by shifting its complex plane. This shift due to the exponential factor significantly affects the outcome of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), making it dependent on both the quadratic and exponential transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
