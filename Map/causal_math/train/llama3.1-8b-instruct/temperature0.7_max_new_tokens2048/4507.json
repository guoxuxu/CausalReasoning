  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\) where \\( f(t) \\) is a time-dependent function and \\( s \\) is a complex variable. We analyze the causal influence of multiplying \\( f(t) \\) by a complex exponential \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real number.\n\nIf another function \\( g(t) = e^{-i\\theta t} \\) (where \\( \\theta \\) is a real number) is applied as an intervention at a time \\( t_1 \\), changing \\( f(t) \\) to \\( f''(t) = e^{-i\\theta t}f(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\), will \\( F''(s) \\) be equivalent to a simple transformation of \\( F(s) \\) applying only linear translations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( g(t) = e^{-i\\theta t} \\) affects only the part of \\( f(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\), resulting in a more complex relationship that includes split behavior based on time. The Laplace transform \\( F''(s) \\) would reflect this change but is not describable by a simple translation or linear transformation of \\( s \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Multiplication of f(t) by e^(iωt) → F(s) becomes a shift in the complex frequency domain; θ → ω; f(t) → e^(-iθt)f(t); t_1 → Time of intervention"
