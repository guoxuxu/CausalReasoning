  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex domain \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions. We investigate the effect of the complex integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the untransformed function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval \\\\( [0, T] \\\\) after observing its transformed version \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}(z(T)) \\\\) without knowing the specific complex constant \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without exact knowledge of the complex constant \\\\( s \\\\), the effect of the exponential factor \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during transformation remains undetermined, making it impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}(z(T)) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
