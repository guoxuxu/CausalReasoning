  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied to a periodic function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Analyze how different types of interventions (applying a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) depending on a parameter matrix \\\\( P \\\\)) affect the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention \\\\( L_P(f) = P f(t) \\\\), with matrix \\\\( P \\\\) altering the amplitude and phase of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), is applied before transforming \\\\( f(t) \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) be different from the one without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into a new function where both the amplitude and phase might be changed; this results in an altered sine wave. The new Laplace transform will reflect these changes, showing different coefficients dependent on the elements of \\\\( P \\\\). This transformation will not merely be a scalar multiple of the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\), indicating a distinct result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
