  "Problem": "Consider a complex function governed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. The function is then subjected to a Laplace transform resulting in a transformed function \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nCan the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) be uniquely determined by observing \\\\( F(s) \\\\) resulting from the Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) could correspond to multiple matrices \\\\( A \\\\) having the same spectrum but different Jordan forms, resulting in ambiguity in recovering \\\\( A \\\\) exactly without additional data or constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
