  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. Explore the effect of the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\), where S is a constant matrix, on the system's behavior over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ut}z \\\\) (where U is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A, B, C, D and not on S or U?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) further modifies the complex function's path, thus the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends not only on A, B, C, D but also significantly on S and U. Both transformations \\\\( e^{St} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ut} \\\\) affect how the function evolves and consequently the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
