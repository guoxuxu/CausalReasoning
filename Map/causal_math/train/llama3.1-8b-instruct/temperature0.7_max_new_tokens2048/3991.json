  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) where z is a complex variable. We explore the function behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( T[F](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} F(t) dt \\\\) with respect to the Laplace transform when \\\\( F(t) = f(t) \\\\) for t in the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention by modifying the parameter from t to \\\\( t^2 \\\\) (i.e., considering \\\\( f(t) = e^{i(t^2)} \\\\)) is performed before applying the Laplace transform, will the transformation still predict a simple decayed oscillation of the original function \\\\( e^{it} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the function to \\\\( e^{i(t^2)} \\\\) significantly changes its behavior. The resulting transformation does not merely predict a decayed oscillation of \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) as the growth of the power within the exponential leads to different characteristics compared to a linear time function, resulting in effects like spreading of the spectrum and modified decay rates.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "modification of t → change in f(t); change in f(t) → change in F(t); change in F(t) → change in T[F](s); modification of t → change in T[F](s); change in T[F](s) → change in predicted oscillation behavior"
