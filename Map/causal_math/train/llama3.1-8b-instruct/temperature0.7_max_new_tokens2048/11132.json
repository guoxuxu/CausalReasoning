  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents propagation in time under a harmonic oscillator dynamic with a certain frequency. We introduce an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{i \\\\alpha s} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nGiven the transformed output at \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we accurately determine if an intervention changing \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) was used, based solely on the result from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform output at any T combines the effects of initial frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the intervention frequency \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and the transformation parameter \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\). Multiple combinations of these variables could yield the same output, rendering it impossible to precisely infer the intervention or its characteristics solely from the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
