  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant and the function maps a real value \\\\(t\\\\) to a point on the complex unit circle. We examine the effects of applying a linear transformation \\\\(f(z) = Az\\\\), where A is a complex square matrix, at different times.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\) is applied to the state \\\\(z_0 = e^{i\\\\omega t_0}\\\\) at time \\\\(t_0 = 0\\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0\\\\) without further intervention, will the state at any time \\\\(t\\\\) be equivalent to applying \\\\(f\\\\) directly to \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( Az_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) alters the initial state. Given the properties of linear transformations and exponential functions, the result of evolving \\\\( Az_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and directly applying \\\\( f \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will differ, unless A commutes perfectly with the exponential function, which generally is not the case.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
