  "Problem": "Analyzing a system where the output z is defined by the Fourier transform of x, denoted as \\\\( z(t) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{x(t)\\\\} \\\\), and x is modulated by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where a is a constant.\n\nCan we unequivocally determine the sequence or types of modulations (whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( k(t) \\\\), or both) used before Fourier transforming, simply from observing \\\\( z'(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\( z'(\\\\omega) \\\\), it is not possible to distinguish specifically whether the signal was modulated by \\\\( h(t) \\\\), \\\\( k(t) \\\\) or both since the resultant frequency shift could potentially be produced by several combinations of different a and b values in exponential modulation functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
