  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions evolving via the system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. The whole system undergoes a Laplace transform, leading to a transformed space where \\\\( sX(s) = AX(s) \\\\) and \\\\( sY(s) = BY(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we resolve which transformations and interventions (through matrices A, B, or C) occurred, assuming no information except \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is provided?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations and interventions might lead to the same endpoint due to the non-linear interactions introduced by the intervention function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\). Without additional information, the potential overlap in transformation influences from A, B, and C makes it impossible to uniquely determine the pathway.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
