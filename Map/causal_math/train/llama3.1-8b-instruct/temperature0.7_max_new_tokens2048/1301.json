  "Problem": "Analyze the causal effects in a linear control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and u represents a control input. The impact of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Exp(Dt)x \\\\) over time t, where D is another constant matrix, is considered.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to that obtained by directly evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under the same system to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(x) = Exp(Dt)x \\\\) modifies the initial state, which can change the trajectory of the system. The additional effect of \\\\( Exp(Dt) \\\\) could result in a substantially different path due to how D interacts with M and N.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
