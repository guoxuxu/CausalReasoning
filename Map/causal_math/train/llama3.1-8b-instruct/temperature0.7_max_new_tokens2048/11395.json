  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit involving a resistor, inductor, and capacitor in series, governed by the second-order linear differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\\\frac{di}{dt} + \\\\frac{1}{C} i = 0\\\\). Suppose a voltage transformation given by \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{st} \\\\) is applied to the circuit, where \\\\( V_0 \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf an additional impedance \\\\( Z \\\\) is introduced at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, does the final response of the circuit depend only on the original circuit parameters (L, R, C) and not on the transformed voltage \\\\( V_0, s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional impedance changes the overall impedance of the circuit, thereby altering how the applied voltage \\\\( V_0 e^{st} \\\\) interacts with the circuit. The response will depend not just on L, R, and C but also critically on the parameters of the voltage transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
