  "Problem": "A complex function is defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We analyze the effects of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = cz + d \\\\) over time t, where c and d are complex constants.\n\nObserving the output \\\\( L(z(t)) \\\\) at any time t, is it possible to uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) alters the initial and subsequent values by a linear transformation, which can mask the original characteristics of \\\\( z(0) \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of c and d, uniquely deducing \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( L(z(t)) \\\\) is infeasible as multiple combinations of parameters could lead to the same observed output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
