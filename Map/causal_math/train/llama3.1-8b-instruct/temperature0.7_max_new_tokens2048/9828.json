  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) given by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\). For causal inference, analyze the impacts of altering \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s) + \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) without and with interventions.\n\nGiven the resulting \\( f(t) \\) that includes a scaled term \\( n \\cdot e^{at} \\), can we deduce the scaling factor \\( n \\) and the presence of \\( e^{at} \\) with certainty by analyzing \\( f(t) \\) only?",
  "Explanation": "If multiple possible interventions or initial conditions could lead to the inclusion and scaling of \\( e^{at} \\) in \\( f(t) \\), it's not possible to uniquely identify the scale factor \\( n \\) or to affirmatively say that \\( e^{at} \\) was added during the intervention without additional information on the original \\( F(s) \\) or the nature of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
