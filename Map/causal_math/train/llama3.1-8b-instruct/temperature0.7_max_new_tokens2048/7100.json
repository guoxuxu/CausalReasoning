  "Problem": "Analyze the implications of applying a Fourier transform to a signal and then filtering with a kernel represented by H(s), an analytic function in the complex frequency domain, on the properties of the signal.\n\nKnowing the time-domain form of the output signal and the filtering method (time-invariant vs. time-varying), can we accurately determine whether H(s) or H(t, s) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Differentiating between H(s) and H(t, s) based on the output signal alone is complicated due to the similar impacts they can have on a signal's time-domain properties. The ambiguity arises from the lack of unique signaling in the results that distinctly points to either static or dynamic frequency domain interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
