  "Problem": "Consider a quantum mechanics problem where a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) evolves according to the Schrödinger equation with potential \\\\(V(x)\\\\). We examine the situation where an operator \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) acts on \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) before evolution.\n\nIf the operator \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) is applied to the wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) and then the system evolves under the Schrödinger equation until time \\\\(T\\\\), does the state at time \\\\(T\\\\), \\\\(\\\\psi'(x, T)\\\\), differ from that obtained by evolving \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) without applying \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operator \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\) initially modifies the wave function, potentially altering its components and how these evolve under the Schrödinger equation. The evolved state \\\\(\\\\psi'(x, T)\\\\) will reflect these modifications, thus differing from the state obtained without the action of \\\\(\\\\hat{O}\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial wave function \\psi(x, 0) influences the evolved state \\psi'(x, T) through its influence on \\psi(x, T), which is further influenced by \\hat{O}."
