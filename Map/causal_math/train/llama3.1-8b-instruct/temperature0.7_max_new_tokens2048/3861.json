  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x, y) \\\\) where \\\\( u(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2} \\\\. Analysis involves exploring Fourier transform of \\\\( u \\\\), denoted as \\\\( U(f_x, f_y) \\), and how the frequency-domain behavior changes under specific transformations.\n\nIf the origin is shifted by vector \\\\( v = (a, b) \\\\) in the spatial domain to produce a function \\\\( w(x, y) = u(x - a, y - b) \\\\), then performed Fourier transform on \\\\( w \\\\), will \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) \\\\) be a simple shifted version of \\\\( U(f_x, f_y) \\\\) in frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a shifted function results in a phase shift of the transformed function in the frequency domain. Mathematically, this manifests as \\\\( W(f_x, f_y) = U(f_x, f_y) e^{-j2\\\\pi(f_x a + f_y b)} \\\\), indicating a phase-shifted version.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "origin shift in spatial domain → change in input of u; shift in input of u → change in u; change in u → change in Fourier transform U; change in input of Fourier transform U → change in U; shift in spatial domain → change in input of Fourier transform U; change in input of Fourier transform U → W; U → W"
