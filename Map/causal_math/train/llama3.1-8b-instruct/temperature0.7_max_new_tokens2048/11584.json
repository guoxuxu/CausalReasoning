  "Problem": "Consider the response space of a signal processing system, modeled by the integral transform \\( Y(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) \\, dt \\), known as the Laplace transform. We explore the effect of modifying the input signal \\( x(t) \\) by a function \\( f(x) = e^{At}x(t) \\), where A is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( Y(s) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( Y(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\( Y(s) \\) can potentially result from different sequences or types of interventions. The alterations due to exponential transformations \\( e^{At} \\) and any applied \\( R(t) \\) introduce unknown scaling parameters and functions, hence making it impossible to uniquely back-calculate exact interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
