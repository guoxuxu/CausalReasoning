  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function \\\\( z = h(x) \\\\) is defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\), and \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine how the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix, impacts the system over a period of time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}x_0 \\\\) transforms the starting point in the complex plane, which means that the subsequent evolution under \\\\( h(x) = x^2 + ci \\\\) will proceed from a different initial value than in the untransformed case. This alteration changes the trajectory and hence the final value at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
