  "Problem": "Analyze a mechanical system in a complex plane under the influence of an external force and initial conditions. The position of a particle in the complex plane is described by the equation \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represent the real and imaginary components of the position, respectively, in time t. The position is further affected by the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention involving another transformation \\\\(k(z) = e^{-i\\\\theta t}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant) is applied at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), does the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for some T > t_1 depend solely on the original equations of motion, not on either \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another rotational transformation \\\\(k(z)\\\\) adds another layer of complexity, altering the trajectory of the system. The final position \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends on the initial system dynamics as well as the angular speeds \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\), because both transformations impose additional rotations on the position.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
