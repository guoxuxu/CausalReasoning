  "Problem": "Analyze the outcome of a linear integral transformation \\\\(G(x) = \\\\int_0^1 K(t, x) f(t) dt\\\\) on a function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), where \\\\(K(t, x)\\\\) is a kernel function. We examine the scenarios when the kernel function changes over time, defined as \\\\(K(t, x, s)\\\\) where s represents a parameter influencing the kernel.\n\nIf \\\\(K(t, x)\\\\) is the identity kernel \\\\(\\\\delta(t - x)\\\\) applied to the function \\\\(f(t) = t^2\\\\) and allowed to evolve without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\(G(x)\\\\) at s = 0 be \\\\(x^2\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the identity kernel \\\\(\\\\delta(t - x)\\\\), the integral transformation becomes \\\\(G(x) = \\\\int_0^1 \\\\delta(t - x) t^2 dt\\\\), which simplifies exactly to \\\\(x^2\\\\) when no additional parameters s or other modifications are introduced, since this kernel directly evaluates the function at t = x.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
