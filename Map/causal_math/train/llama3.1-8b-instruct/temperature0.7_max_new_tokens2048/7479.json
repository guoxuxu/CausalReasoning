  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + k^2 u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx}u(x)dx\\\\) on the function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) and its alteration after a transformation defined by \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + ax \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at some point \\\\(x_0\\\\), a new function \\\\(w(x) = u(x) + bx^2\\\\) (where \\\\(b\\\\) is another constant) is introduced as an intervention, will the final outcome of the Fourier transform of \\\\(v(x)\\\\) at some range depend only on the original function and not on \\\\(a\\\\) or \\\\(b\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\(w(x)\\\\) as an intervention modifies the original function by adding a \\\\(bx^2\\\\) term, changing the result of the Fourier transform. Both \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) alter the function in ways that affect the outcome of the transformation, not merely depending on the original function \\\\(u(x)\\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
