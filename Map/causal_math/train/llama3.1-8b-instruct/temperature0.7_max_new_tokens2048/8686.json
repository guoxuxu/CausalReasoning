  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwt} \\phi(t) dt \\), where \\( \\phi(t) \\) is a given function and w is a complex parameter. Analyze how the application of the Fourier transform affects the behavior of the function \\( \\phi(t) \\) and its causality in terms of exponential decay functions \\( e^{-at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a positive real number.\n\nKnowing only the spectrum \\( z(w) \\) and assuming the original function was \\( \\phi(t) = e^{-at} \\), can we precisely determine if there was an additional decay term \\( e^{-bt} \\) applied over time without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific details about the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) or without separate characterizations of the effects of each on the spectrum, it is impossible to discern whether the spectrum \\( z(w) \\) corresponds to additional exponential decays applied over time or simply the term \\( e^{-at} \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
