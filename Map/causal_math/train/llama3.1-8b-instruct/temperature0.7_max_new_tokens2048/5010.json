  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. We evaluate the role of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Re^{Dt}z \\\\) (where R is a rotation matrix and D is another constant matrix) over time t.\n\nKnowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, is it possible to unambiguously deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without prior knowledge whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The rotational and potentially exponential scaling effects from R and D can modify the initial state in ways that are not immediately reversible without additional information. Since multiple initial states can lead to the same endpoint due to these transformations, deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely is not possible without knowing the history of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
