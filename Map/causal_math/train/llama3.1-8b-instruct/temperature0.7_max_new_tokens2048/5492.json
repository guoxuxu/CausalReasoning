  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where vectors are transformed by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\), and an integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(x) = \\\\int_a^b K(x, y) f(y) dy \\\\) operates on functions where \\\\( K(x, y) \\\\) is a kernel function. We analyze the system's behavior when an initial function \\\\( f_0 \\\\) is either subjected directly to \\\\( T \\\\) or modified by a linear operation before application of \\\\( T \\\\).\n\nGiven knowledge of the final output and the matrix \\\\( M \\\\), can we determine whether a transformation by matrix \\\\( N \\\\) was applied prior to \\\\( T \\\\) without any errors?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformations \\\\( T \\\\) and the linear matrices \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\) could variously influence the outcome depending on their specific properties and inter-relationships, identifying the presence of the intervention by matrix \\\\( N \\\\) exclusively from the output and knowledge of \\\\( M \\\\) isn't definitively possible without further information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Knowledge of final output → Determination of transformation by N; Knowledge of matrix M → Determination of transformation by N; Initial function f0 → Transformation by M → Determination of transformation by N; Initial function f0 → Transformation by N → Transformation by T → Determination of transformation by N; Transformation by M → Transformation by T → Determination of transformation by N"
