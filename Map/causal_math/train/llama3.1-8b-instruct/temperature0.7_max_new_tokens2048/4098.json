  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a resistor (R) and an inductor (L) forming an RL circuit, subjected to a voltage \\( V(t) \\) described as a sinusoidal input \\( V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\). The response of the circuit is analyzed by examining the current \\( I(t) \\), and we analyze the effect of a transformation \\( f(I) = e^{st}I \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the observed response \\( I(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we ascertain whether \\( f(I) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) without any additional information about the initial state of the circuit?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the initial state or the specific parameters of \\( f(I) \\), it is impossible to accurately distinguish whether the observed \\( I(t) \\) was a result of the natural response of the RL circuit or influenced by the transformation, due to the complexity in the interaction between the exponential functions and sinusoidal input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
