  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) in the Laplace transform domain, where a is a constant. This function corresponds to the solution \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} u(t) \\\\) in the time domain, with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) being a step function. We analyze the impact of multiplying by another function \\\\( g(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-b} \\\\), corresponding to \\\\( g(t) = e^{bt} u(t) \\\\) in the time domain, and where b is also a constant.\n\nIf the product \\\\( h(s) = z(s) \\\\times g(s) \\\\) is applied as the initial transform and then inverse Laplace transformed, will the time-domain result \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at any time t be the same as if only \\\\( z(s) \\\\) had been applied and inverse transformed?",
  "Explanation": "By multiplying \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and \\\\( g(s) \\\\), which corresponds to convolution of \\\\( e^{at} u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} u(t) \\\\) in time domain, resulting in a new function \\\\( t e^{(a+b)t} u(t) \\\\). This demonstrates that the dynamics and output in the time domain are substantially altered by the convolution, making it different from the case where only \\\\( z(s) \\\\) is used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
