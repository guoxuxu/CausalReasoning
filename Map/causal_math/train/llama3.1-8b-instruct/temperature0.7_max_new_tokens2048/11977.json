  "Problem": "Consider a function space influenced by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and consider the integral transform \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} K(x, t) f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transform. The challenge is to assess how transformations and inverses of these operators affect the functions within this space.\n\nKnowing the outcome of the integral transform \\\\( T[f] \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( f \\\\) accurately without knowing modifications on \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) from operator \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about modifications by \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\), the unaltered function \\\\( f \\\\) cannot be unequivocally inferred from \\\\( T[f] \\\\). The properties and changes induced by \\\\( L \\\\) on the kernel could drastically alter the mapping in a way that obscures the pre-transform state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
