  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The effect of the Laplace transform on this function is studied, denoting the transform as \\\\( L\\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\).\n\nCan we unequivocally identify the type and time of intervention from the final Laplace transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Although \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) reveals the components \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega'} \\\\), it does not provide explicit information about the exact time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) or the specific nature of how the intervention was applied (e.g., immediately, gradually), demonstrating limitations in inferring the full details of the intervention from \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
