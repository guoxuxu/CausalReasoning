  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that evolves over time according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the behavior of the system under the influence of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) modifies the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The evolution according to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) leads to \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), while the transformed initial condition evolves as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\alpha)t} z_0 \\\\). This difference makes the state at time T different due to the additional \\\\( \\\\alpha t \\\\) term.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
