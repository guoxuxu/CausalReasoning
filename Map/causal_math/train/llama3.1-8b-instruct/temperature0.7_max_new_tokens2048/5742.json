  "Problem": "Consider a linear space of functions where the kernel operator K is defined on a function y(x). The relationship between y and its image under K is described through a convolution, i.e., \\\\( K*y = \\\\int h(t) y(x-t) dt \\\\), where h(t) is an impulse response function. We are interested in how the application of Fourier Transform (\\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)) might influence this relationship.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform of the convolution result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(K*y) \\\\), can we uniquely recover the function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) without prior knowledge on the usage of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The recovery of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(K*y) \\\\) requires knowledge of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h) \\\\). Without information on whether \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) or another operation altered \\\\( y(x) \\\\), and the particular form of h(t), the original function y cannot be uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
