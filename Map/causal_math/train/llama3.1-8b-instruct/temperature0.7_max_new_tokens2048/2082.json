  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) where \\\\(\\omega\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency. We are interested in observing how an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\int_0^t f(s) ds \\\\) affects this function over time t.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) at t = T, can we perfectly reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t in [0, T] without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) loses information about the phase of the original exponential function, providing only accumulated magnitude data. As a result, reconstructing the precise oscillatory nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely from \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) is impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
