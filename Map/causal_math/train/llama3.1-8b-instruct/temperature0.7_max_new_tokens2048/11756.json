  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the harmonic oscillator equations \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\ddot{y} = -\\\\omega^2 y\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a constant. We explore how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which transforms a function into its frequency components, affects the inference capabilities within the system dynamics.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) is computed at t = 0 and then the inverse Fourier transform is applied, resulting in \\\\( z'(t) \\\\), will \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at any t be identical to \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and its inverse form a perfect reconstruction pair for functions satisfying certain conditions, which includes the oscillatory functions described by the system. Hence, the initial state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be fully recovered leading to an identical function over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
