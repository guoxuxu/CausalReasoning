  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\), where A is a complex constant. Investigate the influence of the transformation defined by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{Bt}z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, which affects the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since B influences the exponential growth rate and direction differently from A, the state at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), differs from that obtained by direct evolution from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under A alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
