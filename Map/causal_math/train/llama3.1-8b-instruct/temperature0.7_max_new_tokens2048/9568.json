  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex numbers, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We will study the changes in the function with respect to the integration operator over time defined as \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), and analyze the influence of modifications by derivative with respect to time.\n\nGiven the final value \\\\( F(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine if the intervention (application of g(t)) took place, and at what time it was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( F(T) \\\\), it is not possible to determine uniquely whether the intervention occurred, much less the specific time of its application. The intervention could result in various modifications of the integral result depending on its time and nature, and other function parameters or interventions could equivalently result in the same \\\\( F(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
