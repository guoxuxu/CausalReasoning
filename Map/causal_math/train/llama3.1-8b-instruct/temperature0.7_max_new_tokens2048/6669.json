  "Problem": "Consider the system of complex functions defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is iterated over time t, generating a sequence in the complex plane that can exhibit dynamics typical of the Julia set. We explore the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA}z ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix, on this sequence.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) without further intervention, will the sequence at t = T follow the same trajectory as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had been directly evolved under \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) prior to the iteration effectively alters the starting point of the sequence in the complex function, thus changing the trajectory. Since this intervention modifies the initial condition, the dynamics of the sequence will also be altered, diverging from the original path had no \\\\( g(z) \\\\) been applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
