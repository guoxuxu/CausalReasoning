  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the integral transform \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. This scenario explores both the direct evolution of the function and the impact of modifications through an operational function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is implemented on a function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) and then the transformed function is subjected to \\\\( T \\\\), will the outcome of \\\\( T(f(z_0))(t) \\\\) at time t = T be the same as \\\\( T(z_0)(t) \\\\) evolved directly at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the original function by morphing it with the exponential factor \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\), which alters the input of the integral transform \\\\( T \\\\). This leads to different integration results since the transformation adaptively changes the function's values over the interval [0, T].",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
