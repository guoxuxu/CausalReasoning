  "Problem": "Investigate the causal relationship in a system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} + M\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x} = N z \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. The influence of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z) \\\\) is applied which initially alters the state by converting space-domain information in z into frequency-domain.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(x,T) \\\\), can we determine with certainty the specific transformations applied (Fourier transform, wavelet transform, both, or none) based solely on \\\\( z(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( z(x,T) \\\\) could feasibly arise from various combinations of the actions taken (applying Fourier transform, wavelet transform, both, or neither), especially since the transformations might affect the system in overlapping ways. The ambiguity in interactions and the transformation mechanics make it challenging to discern which actions were precisely implemented.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "M → N; N → z; Fourier transform → z; z → z(x,T); Fourier transform → z(x,T); z(x,T) → specific transformations applied"
