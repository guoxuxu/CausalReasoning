  "Problem": "Analyzing the behavior of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{At} dt \\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and exploring how its behavior changes when transformed by function \\\\( T_M(t) = Me^{At}M^{-1} \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nWill the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T T_M(t) dt \\\\) be equivalent to the matrix M times the integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{At} dt \\\\) times M^{-1} under the transformation \\\\( T_M(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation preserves the integral due to the properties of matrix multiplication and similarity transformations. Specifically, \\\\( T_M(t) = Me^{At}M^{-1} \\\\) implies that the integral over this transformed function becomes \\\\( M(\\\\int_0^T e^{At} dt)M^{-1} \\\\), showing a direct calculation of the transformed integral using the change of basis defined by M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
