  "Problem": "Explore a system governed by a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z(0) \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and consider the effect of a distinct transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex matrix. Analyze the state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under various conditions and transformations.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to an initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z(0) \\\\) without further intervention, will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly to t = T without the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "When \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), it alters the initial condition to \\\\( e^{D0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), seemingly unchanged at t=0. However, the continual impact of \\\\( D \\\\) in \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) changes the evolution path. Even though it starts at the same initial condition, the modification caused by the exponential term \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) distinctively influences the trajectory, thus differing at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
