  "Problem": "In a physics experiment, a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) is modeled using the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a Hamiltonian operator. We run simulations using an initial condition \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) modified by a function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) representing a constant wave number.\n\nCan we determine the original wave function \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine if the observed \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) resulted from an evolved \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) or from an evolved \\\\( f(\\\\psi_0(x)) \\\\) due to the phase shift introduced by \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
