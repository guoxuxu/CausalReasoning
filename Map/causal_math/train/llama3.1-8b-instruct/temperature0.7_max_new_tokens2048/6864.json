  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where we study the impact of a transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{wz} \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{t^{2}} dt \\\\) over a complex variable z, with w being another constant complex number.\n\nKnowing the final result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( z = Z \\\\) and being aware an intervention occurred, can we definitively infer the specific transformations (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) might lead to the same final value of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) due to the complex interplay and non-linear modifications they impose on the function and its domain. Thus, it is impossible to exclusively discern the specific transformations used just from the endpoint \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "w → h(z); h(z) → f(z); z → f(z); intervention → change in f(z); change in f(z) → knowledge of final result of f(z); knowledge of final result of f(z) and intervention → possible transformations (h(z), k(z))"
