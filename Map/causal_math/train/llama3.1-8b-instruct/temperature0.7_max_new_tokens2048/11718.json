  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{z} \\) acting over the complex plane, where transformations are applied via complex integral transformations such as the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{f\\} \\). The system explores changes in the complex function domain and their propagation through the transformation.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{f\\} \\) of the function \\( e^z \\), can we reconstruct the original function \\( f(z) \\) across the entire complex plane without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform, by its nature, limits its focus to specific aspects of \\( f(z) \\) (typically along the real axis), and does not retain all the information about the behavior of the function for all complex values of z. Additional complex extensions or other integral transformations may be required.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Complex function domain → Laplace transform; \n                    Laplace transform → Complex integral transformation; \n                    Complex integral transformation → Reconstruction of original function"
