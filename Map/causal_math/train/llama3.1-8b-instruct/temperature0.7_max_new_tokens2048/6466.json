  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function of time. We investigate the causal effects of operations on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and their expression through the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\).\n\nIf we observe \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after some time T, and it shows a change, can we conclude that exactly \\\\( h(z) = z(t) + ce^{-dt} \\\\) was applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting \\\\( g(z) \\\\) being a complex integral, many different modifications to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), such as scaling or other forms of time-decaying functions, could produce similar changes in the integral, thus an exact deduction of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is not possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
