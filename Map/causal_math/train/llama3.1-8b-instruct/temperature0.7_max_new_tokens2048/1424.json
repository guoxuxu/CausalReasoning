  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix representing mechanical dynamics. Additionally, consider a transformation applied to the state described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}\\\\)z, where D is another constant matrix and t represents time.\n\nBy knowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and that the initial and intermediate transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) might have been applied, can we specifically identify which interventions were used?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially arise from various combinations and sequences of applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), compounded by the natural evolution under M. Therefore, the specific interventions used are not uniquely deducible just from the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
