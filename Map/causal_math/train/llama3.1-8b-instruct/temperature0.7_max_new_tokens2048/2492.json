  "Problem": "Consider a nondeterministic control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves over time according to a stochastic differential equation \\\\( dz = Mz \\\\, dt + N \\\\, dW \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( dW \\\\) representing the differential of a Wiener process. We investigate how applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = S^{-1}z \\\\) affects the path of the system, where S is a constant, invertible matrix.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether interventions \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( q(z) \\\\), or both were applied and in what order, merely by examining the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The similar potential outcomes arising from differing sequences of interventions and the stochastic nature of the differential equation means that without additional information, it is infeasible to unequivocally discern the nature and order of transformations applied to the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
