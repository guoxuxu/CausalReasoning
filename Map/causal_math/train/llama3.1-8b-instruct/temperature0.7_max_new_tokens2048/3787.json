  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{at + bi} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and represent the growth rate and oscillation frequency, respectively. The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is used to analyze the system properties.\n\nIf a damping factor \\\\( e^{-ct} \\\\), where \\\\( c > 0 \\\\) is introduced as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be independent of the oscillatory frequency \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a damping factor modifies the natural progression of the function, imposing an additional exponential decay. However, this does not eliminate or make the output Laplace transform independent of the oscillatory component \\\\( b \\\\); both the decay rate and the frequency will influence the resultant Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
