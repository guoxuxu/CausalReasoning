  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{tA}z_0 \\\\) describes the evolution of a variable vector \\\\( z \\\\) through a linear transformation system in time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. Another function \\\\( w(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is also a constant matrix, applies another linear transformation at an arbitrary time.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( w(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( w(z) \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The transformation \\\\( C \\\\) could have modified \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in various ways depending on its properties relative to \\\\( A \\\\), leading to different possible initial states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
