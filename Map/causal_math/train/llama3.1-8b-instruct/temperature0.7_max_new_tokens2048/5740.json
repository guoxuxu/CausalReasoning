  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution u(x,t) in a rod is governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity constant. The transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nGiven the heat distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both) merely by knowing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final heat distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) may not uniquely determine the interventions used, due to the potential for overlapping effects from the transformations \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\lambda t} \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) = u - e^{-\\mu t} \\\\). Multiple combinations of \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\mu \\\\) values may lead to similar or even identical distributions at time T, making it difficult to pinpoint the precise sequence or type of interventions applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
