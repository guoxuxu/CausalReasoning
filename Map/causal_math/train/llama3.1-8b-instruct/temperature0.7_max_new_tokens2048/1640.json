  "Problem": "Consider a system where the rate of heat transfer \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature distribution along the rod. A transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h \\\\), where h is a constant heating term, is applied to the rod's temperature distribution.\n\nGiven the final observed temperature distribution, can the exact series of interventions (heating by \\\\( f(u) \\\\), cooling by \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both) applied over time be determined uniquely?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations and timings of heating and cooling interventions could lead to the same final temperature distribution. Without precise information about the timing and magnitude of these interventions, it is not possible to unique deduce the sequence of actions taken.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
