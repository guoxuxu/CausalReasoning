  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the linear differential equation \\\\(dz/dt = Mz\\\\), where M represents a square matrix. We explore the consequence of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) at some initial condition and examine its impact on system dynamics.\n\nSuppose at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( F^{-1}(z) = \\\\int e^{i\\\\omega t}z(\\\\omega) d\\\\omega \\\\) is applied. Will the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on matrix M, disregarding any earlier effect from the initial Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse transform reconstitutes the state back into the time domain potentially with changes due to initial Fourier transform. Hence, the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is shaped by both the initial Fourier transformation and its inverse, alongside the influence of matrix M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
