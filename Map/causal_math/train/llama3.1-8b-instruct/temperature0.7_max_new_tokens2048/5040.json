  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation scenario governed by the equation \\\\( z = Cw \\\\) in the complex domain, where C is a complex matrix. Additionally, we have an integral transform of z, defined as \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( T(z) \\\\) after multiple transformations involving matrices C and D, is it possible to deduce precisely which transformations (\\\\( C \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), or both) were applied based only on the outcome \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations applied by matrices \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\), and the integral transform \\\\( T \\\\), collectively affect the output in a complex manner. Due to the overlapping effects and the convoluted nature of integral transformations in the complex plane, discerning the specific sequence or type of transformations from the final state \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alone is ambiguous and infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
