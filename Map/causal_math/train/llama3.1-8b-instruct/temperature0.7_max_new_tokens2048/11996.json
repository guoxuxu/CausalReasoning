  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The complex function transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) is initially applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and allowed to evolve according to the PDE without any intervention, will the resulting \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) at time T be purely determined by the operator L?",
  "Explanation": "While L governs the evolution of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\), the transformation \\\\( v(x, t) \\\\) introduces the factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), altering the solution due to the multiplication by a time-dependent exponential term. This complex exponential can affect the solution's behavior, not solely predicted by L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
