  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) representing a control function. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, where A is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new control function \\\\( v \\\\) is introduced at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), replacing \\\\( u \\\\), will the transformed state \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at T depend only on the initial conditions and the new control \\\\( v \\\\), assuming no other interactions?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new control function \\\\( v \\\\) mid-process modifies the system's trajectory in conjunction with the earlier control \\\\( u \\\\) and the system matrices M and N. Thus, the outcome \\\\( T(z) \\\\) depends on the entire history of controls applied (both \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\)), the system dynamics, and the matrix exponential transformation \\\\( e^{At} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
