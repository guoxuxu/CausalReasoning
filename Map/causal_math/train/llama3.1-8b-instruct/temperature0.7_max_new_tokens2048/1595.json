  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the Laplace transform of its impulse response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The behavior of the circuit is impacted by alternating the parameters of its elements, such as resistors (R), inductors (L), and capacitors (C). Let's analyze how variations in these parameters, modeled as a complex function \\\\\\( f(R, L, C) = RLCs^2 + (R+L)s + C \\\\\\), influence the overall impulse response over time domain, represented by the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\\\( H(s) \\\\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\), the circuit's parameters are adjusted dramatically (e.g., R is doubled, L is halved), will the impulse response at \\\\\\( t = T \\\\\\) (for T > t_1) be solely dependent on the original parameters and not on the altered values at \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing R, L, or C at \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\) effectively creates a new system characterized by a new \\\\\\( H(s) \\\\\\), which impacts the subsequent behavior and impulse response of the circuit. The changes made at \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\) will influence the results at \\\\\\( t = T \\\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
