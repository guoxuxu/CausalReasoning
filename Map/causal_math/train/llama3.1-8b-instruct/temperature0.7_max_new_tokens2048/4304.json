  "Problem": "Consider a quantum mechanical system where the state vector \\\\( \\\\psi(t) \\\\) is governed by the Schrödinger equation with a time-independent Hamiltonian H. We study the effect of applying a linear operator \\\\( U = e^{-iHt} \\\\) on the state vector at different times.\n\nCan we precisely identify the interventions (whether \\\\( U \\\\), \\\\( V \\\\), or both) used on the system, given the final state \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) and knowledge of H and G?",
  "Explanation": "The complexities introduced by the interventions using different Hamiltonians and the superposition principle in quantum mechanics make it difficult to disentangle and uniquely identify the sequence or type of interventions. Multiple combinations of applications of \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( V \\\\) can result in indistinguishably similar final states \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
