  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x\\\\) defines a transformation in the complex plane, with \\\\(x\\\\) as an initial complex number and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) as a real constant frequency. We explore the effects of the Fourier transform \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\) on this function and the implications on the frequency-domain representation.\n\nCan we perfectly deduce \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(\\omega\\\\) solely from the Fourier-transformed data, without knowledge of the time-domain representation?",
  "Explanation": "While the frequency \\\\(\\omega\\\\) can be accurately deduced from the location of the peak in the frequency spectrum, the initial amplitude \\\\(x\\\\) cannot be determined without information about the phase or normalization used in the Fourier transform process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
