  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant representing the angular frequency and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an initially real-valued function. The impact of Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\) is studied to understand its transformation properties and the system behavior.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 > 0 \\\\), will the new transform \\\\( Z''(s) \\\\) solely reflect the change in \\\\( u(t) \\\\) with original \\\\( \\omega \\\\), without showing effects from the new \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the angular frequency to \\\\( \\omega' \\\\), which affects both the phase and the frequency components of the output signal represented in the complex plane. Therefore, \\\\( Z''(s) \\\\) will manifest changes due to both the original \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and the new frequency \\\\( \\omega' \\\\), altering the properties of the transform significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
