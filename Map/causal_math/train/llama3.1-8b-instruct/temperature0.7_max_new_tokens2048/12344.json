  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time, and \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Fourier Transform on the function, defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time t, and Fourier Transform \\\\(F(z)\\\\) is applied, will the result \\\\( F(z) \\\\) reflect a direct transform of the function without alteration in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) linearly transforms the time-domain signal, \\\\(z(t)\\\\), to the frequency domain, reflecting the true frequency characteristics laid out by \\\\(z(t)\\\\) exactly according to the transform definition without any alterations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
