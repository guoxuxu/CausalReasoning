  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous-time linear system controlled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. Consider the application of the Laplace transform on the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Nx} \\\\), where N is another constant matrix, and study its effects over time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is invoked on an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) continuously without further interventions, will this result in the same final state at t = T compared to simply allowing \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) modifies the initial state to \\\\( e^{Nx} x_0 \\\\), which can significantly change the system's trajectory from that point forward. Unless N and M commute in particular ways that allow their exponential effects to be aligned, the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) will typically differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
