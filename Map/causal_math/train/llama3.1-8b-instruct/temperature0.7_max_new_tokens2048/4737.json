  "Problem": "We consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) where A is a constant matrix. The system is subjected to an integral transform defined by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B\\\\tau}x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is transformed at t = 0 by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) for a period T without any other intervention, will the outcome \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be identical to the evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) for the same period?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) alters the initial state by integrating the effect of \\\\( e^{B\\\\tau} \\\\) over time, changing the trajectory of the system from that point onward. Since \\\\( g(x) \\\\) incorporates a convolution with a matrix exponential, the original dynamics governed solely by A are fundamentally modified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
