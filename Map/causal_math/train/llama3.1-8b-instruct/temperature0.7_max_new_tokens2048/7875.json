  "Problem": "Consider a complex function represented by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and x is a constant vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). We explore how different transformations influence the behavior of function z over time using the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to simplify the analysis.\n\nAssuming an intervention is carried out by applying another transformation \\\\( k(x) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) during the transition at some time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), does the final output of z at time T depend only on the initial matrix A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformation matrices B and C, apart from the initial matrix A, have substantial implications on the resultant state of z(T). The intervention introduces a new dynamic at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) that alters the trajectory and final state based on how C interacts with A and possibly B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
