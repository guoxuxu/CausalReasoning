  "Problem": "Consider a Riemann surface defined by the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\lambda t} \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) is a complex constant. The function \\( T(z) = z^k \\) is used as a transformation where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\nIf the transformation \\( T(z) \\) is applied to \\( z_0 = e^{i\\lambda 0} = 1 \\) at t = 0, and then \\( z(t) \\) is allowed to evolve under its own dynamics without further transformation, will the transformed state \\( z'(t) = (e^{i\\lambda t})^k \\) at t = T follow the same trajectory as if \\( z(t) \\) was evolved without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T(z) \\) directly scales the magnitude and rotates the phase of the trajectory. Since the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\lambda t} \\) is periodic, applying \\( T(z) \\) still preserves the natural evolution under \\( z'(t) = (e^{i\\lambda t})^k \\). The effect of the transformation is to change the frequency of oscillation by a factor of \\( k \\), which does not alter the fundamental trajectory but only the rate of traversal.",
