  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined in the complex plane as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The equation determines the trajectory of \\\\( z \\\\) as a function of time \\\\( t \\\\) on a unit circle in the complex plane. Analyze the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a positive integer.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\) (where \\\\( m \\\\) is another positive integer) is applied as an intervention at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the resultant point \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the parameter \\\\( w \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) = z^m \\\\) adds another complicating layer, making the final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependant on \\\\( k \\\\), \\\\( m \\\\), and \\\\( w \\\\). The new transformation changes the order of the exponential function further, altering the trajectory and endpoint, influenced by these multiples of the frequency \\\\( w \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
