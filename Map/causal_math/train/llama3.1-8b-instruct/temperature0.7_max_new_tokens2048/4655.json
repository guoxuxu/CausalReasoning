  "Problem": "Consider a function modeled by a complex variable transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\) where z is a complex number. We evaluate the effects of an additional transformation defined as \\\\( g(z) = z + a \\\\), where a is a complex constant, on the analytic function w.\n\nIf before applying \\\\( w(z) \\\\), another transformation, \\\\( h(z) = z - b \\\\) (where b is another complex constant), is used as an intervention at a specific point, will the outcome solely depend on the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) irrespective of the constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\), along with the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), results in a final input to \\\\( w \\\\) of \\\\( z_0 + a - b \\\\). Thus, the outcome at \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is influenced by both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), affecting the resultant state based on how these complex shifts interact.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
