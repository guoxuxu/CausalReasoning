  "Problem": "Analyzing the system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi)\\\\) applied to the function u(x, t), and how it evolves over time.\n\nIf \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi)\\\\) is computed for a function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the function is evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further transformation, will the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) at time t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the solution to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) evolves in a predictable manner determined by the operator L when represented in the Fourier space. The evolution in real space and subsequent transformation to Fourier space should be equivalent to evolving the Fourier transform of the initial condition directly under the transformed operator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
