  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the scenario where an integral transform \\\\( K(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty k(x, s)u(s, t) ds \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) being a kernel function.\n\nCan we accurately determine which transformations (either \\\\( K(u) \\\\), \\\\( J(u) \\\\), or both) were applied based solely on the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) could potentially result from varying applications of the transformations \\\\( K(u) \\\\) and \\\\( J(u) \\\\). Due to the integral nature and potential overlap in effects, it's challenging to pinpoint exactly which transformations or their combinations were executed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
