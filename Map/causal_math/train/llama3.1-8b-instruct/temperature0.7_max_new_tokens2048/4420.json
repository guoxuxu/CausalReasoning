  "Problem": "Examine a complex function's behavior under transformation with the Laplace Transform, where the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). Consider the transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the final time-domain output \\\\( g''(z) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) was used during transformation only by knowing \\\\( g''(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact modifications made in the Laplace domain just from the final time-domain output can be challenging without additional information. The alterations made by \\\\( h(s) \\\\) may result in effects that could theoretically be achieved by different transformations, leading to ambiguity in tracing back to the specific intervention used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
