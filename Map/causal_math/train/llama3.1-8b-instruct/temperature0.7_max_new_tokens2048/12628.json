  "Problem": "Consider the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) governing a system, where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t) dt \\\\) is applied to transform the function over time.\n\nIf \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves under the rule \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = Ax \\\\) from t = 0 to t = T without any intervention, will the Fourier transform at the end, \\\\( F(T) \\\\), be similar to applying the Fourier transform at any intermediate time t and continuing from there?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform incorporates all the history of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from 0 to infinity, scaling each moment by \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\). Transforming at an intermediate time t and continuing means losing all contributions from earlier times, thus affecting the result of \\\\( F(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
