  "Problem": "Analyzing the system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We evaluate the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi)\\\\) applied to the function u(x, t), and how it evolves over time.\n\nConsidering the endpoint \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) in Fourier space, can we determine exactly which interventions (original evolution under L or convolution with v or both) occurred, just from the knowledge of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint in Fourier space \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) could result from various combinations of interventions due to the linear properties of the Fourier transform and convolutions. The spectral characteristics may mask specific details about interventions unless additional information (such as constraints on the form of v) is available.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
