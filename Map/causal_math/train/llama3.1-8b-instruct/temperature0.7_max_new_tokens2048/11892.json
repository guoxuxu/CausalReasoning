  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex number. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex number, influences the function over time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied at the start with initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time t = T differ from the straightforward progression of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) until t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) initially affects the evolution path by integrating the impact of \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The introduction of the term \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) results in a distinct trajectory from a direct evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), altering states at any subsequent time t.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
