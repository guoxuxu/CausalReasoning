  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a set of complex differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. We study the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{St}z dt \\\\), where S is another complex matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively identify what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) by knowing just the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which interventions took place based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes infeasible due to multiple potential paths leading to the same endpoint. These transformations involve complex matrices whose exponential interactions can create similar results under different scenarios.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
