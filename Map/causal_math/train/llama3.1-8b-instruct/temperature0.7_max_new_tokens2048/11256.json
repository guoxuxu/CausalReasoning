  "Problem": "We explore a system governed by a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions represented by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant real matrices. We investigate the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( L{z(t)} = F(s) \\\\) on z(t).\n\nGiven that \\\\( F(s) \\\\) was modified by a transformation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and inverted back to the time domain, is it possible to exactly identify which transformation \\\\( G(s) \\\\) was used based solely on the final output \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining exactly what transformations were applied in the s-domain from the final output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is generally not feasible without more information. Multiple transformations can yield similar effects in the transformed domain, leading to potential ambiguities in identifying the specific intervention performed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation of F(s) → Modification of G(s); Modification of G(s) → Inversion to time domain; Inversion to time domain → z(t); A → F(s); B → F(s); F(s) → z(t); G(s) → F(s); z(t) → G(s) cannot be directly identified"
