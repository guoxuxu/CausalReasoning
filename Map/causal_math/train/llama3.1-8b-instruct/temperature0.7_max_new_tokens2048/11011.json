  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We study the effect of this transformation on the integral paths in the complex plane, specifically focusing on the integral \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) represents a path in the complex plane.\n\nIf an affine transformation \\\\( g(z) = bz + c \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are complex constants) is applied to each point on path \\\\( C \\\\) to get a new path \\\\( C' \\\\), will the transformed integral \\\\( \\\\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz \\\\) be independent of the parameters \\\\( a, b, \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation introduces additional dependence on parameters \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) due to the change in functional form and path. The integral will be affected by both the new path and the modified function, resulting in a dependency on these parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
