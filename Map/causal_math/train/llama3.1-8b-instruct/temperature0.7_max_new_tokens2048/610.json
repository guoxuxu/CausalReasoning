  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\) within the context of complex dynamics, particularly the study of Julia sets, where z and c are complex numbers. This function iteratively generates complex sequences which may display convergence to fixed points or divergence to infinity.\n\nGiven a sequence produced by iteratively applying \\( f \\) converges to a fixed point, can it be concluded that the initial point \\( z_0 \\) must be within the filled Julia set?",
  "Explanation": "If a sequence converges to a fixed point under the given complex function \\( f \\), this convergence typically indicates that the initial point \\( z_0 \\) is within the filled Julia set, where points have non-escaping orbits.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "convergence of sequence → fixed point; z_0 → sequence; sequence → filled Julia set; c → sequence; c → filled Julia set; filled Julia set → sequence convergence",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The convergence of the sequence is influenced by the initial point z_0, which in turn affects the sequence, and both the sequence and the parameter c influence the filled Julia set."
