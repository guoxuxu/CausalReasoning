  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a real scalar constant, representing angular frequency in the complex plane. Study the effects of applying an integral transform \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i\\\\omega \\\\), a complex constant.\n\nIf an additional external function \\\\( w(t) = e^{iCt} \\\\), where C is another real scalar, is multiplied with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before applying the transform \\\\( T \\\\), does the result still depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( w(t) \\\\) before applying \\\\( T \\\\) results in a new function \\\\( u(t) = e^{i( A + C )t} \\\\). The resulting transform, \\\\( T[u] = \\\\frac{1}{s - i(A + C)} \\\\), now depends on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), thus the interference from the additional function alters the relationship and introduces dependence on \\\\( C \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
