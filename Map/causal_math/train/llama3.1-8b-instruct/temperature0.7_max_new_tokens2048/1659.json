  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ct}z dt \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by a new function \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{t_1}^{T} e^{Dt}z dt \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B, not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system's state is modified by the intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by matrices C and D besides A and B. The ongoing application of multiple integrals, based on different matrices, significantly overlaps and affects the endpoint through their combined effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
