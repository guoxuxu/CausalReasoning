  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane by \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\). We analyze transformations applied to this function through the linear operator \\\\( L[f(z)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( L[f(z)] \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) without further modifications or interventions, will the resultant transform for specific s values reveal characteristics directly attributable to the original function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) provides a specific transformation, namely \\\\( L[e^z] = \\\\frac{1}{s-1} \\\\) (for Re(s) > 1), which directly reflects characteristics of the exponential function, such as growth rates and decay.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
