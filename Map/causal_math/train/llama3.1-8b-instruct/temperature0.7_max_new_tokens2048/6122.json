  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The influence of an added Laplace transformation, defined by \\( f(z) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\), on the function \\( z(t) \\) is explored, where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven \\( z(T) \\) at T > 0 after evolving from \\( z_0(t) \\) with the Laplace transformation applied at t = 0, can the original function \\( z_0(t) \\) be perfectly reconstructed without knowing whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstruction of \\( z_0(t) \\) from \\( z(T) \\) without knowing the use of Laplace transformation is not feasible because the transformation's impact on the function's phase and decay rates cannot be reversed accurately without explicit detail of the initial operation and parameters \\( s \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
