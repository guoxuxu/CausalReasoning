  "Problem": "Examine the dynamic system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i x \\\\xi} u(x, t) dx \\\\) applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nCan we precisely identify the intervention (change from L to \\\\( \\\\tilde{L} \\\\)) based only on the Fourier-transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge of the Fourier-transformed state at T does not suffice to uniquely determine the intervention, as the same final transformed state could result from different sequences of operators, especially if the differential operators have overlapping spectral properties. Without additional data on how the transformation influences the state at distinct times, the exact nature of the intervention cannot be definitively identified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
