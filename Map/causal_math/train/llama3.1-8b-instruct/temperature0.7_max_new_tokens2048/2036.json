  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) and its impact on the real and imaginary parts of the complex plane. We are analyzing the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sz} ds \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint at t = T, is it possible to accurately determine whether only \\\\( h(z) \\\\), only \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were used throughout the process, knowing only \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and the final \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the overlapping effects of integral transformations and direct function application, it's impossible to uniquely determine which interventions were used. The transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) may mask each other's influence or intertwine in a way that makes discrete identification unfeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
