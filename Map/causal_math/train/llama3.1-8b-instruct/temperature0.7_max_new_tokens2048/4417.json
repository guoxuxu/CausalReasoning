  "Problem": "Examine a complex function's behavior under transformation with the Laplace Transform, where the function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\). Consider the transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(g)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} g(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sin(z) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( f(s) \\\\) by applying Laplace transform, and then transformed back to the time domain without further alteration, will the resulting function \\\\( g'(z) \\\\) equal the original \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "By the properties of the Laplace Transform, transforming a function to the frequency domain with the Laplace transform and then inverting it back to the time domain without any modification should yield the original function, provided all conditions and assumptions of the Laplace transform are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
