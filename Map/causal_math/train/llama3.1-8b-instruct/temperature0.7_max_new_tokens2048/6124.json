  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. The influence of an added Laplace transformation, defined by \\( f(z) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\), on the function \\( z(t) \\) is explored, where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the final state \\( z(T) \\), can we ascertain precisely what transformations (Laplace, Fourier, or both) were applied during the evolution of \\( z \\) from \\( z_0 \\) to \\( z(T) \\), based solely on the observed \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations used during the evolution from \\( z(T) \\) is complicated due to the possibilities of overlapping effects in the frequency and decay domains by Laplace and Fourier transformations, respectively. The transformations can have overlapping impacts that cloud identification of specific operations used during the function's evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
