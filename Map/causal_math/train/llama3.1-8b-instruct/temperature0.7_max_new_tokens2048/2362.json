  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a time-dependent state in a system. We analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time t.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be deduced from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after it has undergone the transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) without other specific knowledge about the transformation parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation through \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) involves integral accumulations that inherently modify and obscure the original state characteristics. Without knowing the effects of these transformations over time, specifically the values \\(\\omega\\), retracing to the initial conditions accurately is impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
