  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where \\( M \\) is a constant complex matrix. An operator \\( T \\) that transforms \\( z(t) \\) is defined as \\( Tz = e^{Nt}z \\), where \\( N \\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\( z(T) \\) at \\( t = T \\), is it possible to recover the exact initial vector \\( z_0 \\) without knowing whether \\( Tz \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the initial transformation by \\( Tz \\), or the exact form and effect of \\( N \\), recovering \\( z_0 \\) accurately is unfeasible. The transformation \\( e^{Nt} \\) might have altered \\( z_0 \\) in a manner that cannot be deduced merely from observing \\( z(T) \\), especially due to the potential non-invertibility or non-commutativity issues between \\( M \\) and \\( N \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
