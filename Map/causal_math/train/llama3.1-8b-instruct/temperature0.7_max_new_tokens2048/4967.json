  "Problem": "Given a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Wz \\\\), where \\\\( W \\\\) is a complex constant, we consider the impact of the transformation map \\\\( g(z) = e^{Jt}z \\\\) where \\\\( J \\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Kt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( K \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( W \\\\) and not on \\\\( J \\\\) or \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the new intervention function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity, with the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depending not only on \\\\( W \\\\) but also on how the complex exponential transformations \\\\( e^{Jt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\) influence the trajectory and final state, due to their non-commutativity and overlapping effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
