  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( bi \\\\) are real and imaginary components of the complex exponent respectively. The system is subject to the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{(c+di)t}z \\\\), with \\\\( c \\\\), \\\\( d \\\\) being constants. Analyze the evolution and causality of this system over time.\n\nBased on the state observed at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we specifically determine what transformations were applied at what times, given multiple possibilities of transformations like \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g'(z) \\\\) at different times?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity of the interactions between multiple complex exponential transformations over time means that different combinations of parameters and intervention moments can lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This overlap in potential outcomes prevents precise identification of specific transformations or their timing.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
