  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapped to a vector field by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) represents complex numbers and \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix. The action of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is studied on the plane transformed by the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is an integer.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( z \\\\) evolves under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( g(z(T)) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved under \\\\( g(z) \\\\) for a period \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) changes the trajectory in the complex plane. Depending on the power \\\\( n \\\\), this warps the space differently, affecting how \\\\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\\\) acts subsequently. For example, exponentiation and rotations induced by \\\\( z^n \\\\) can lead to different final states under \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
