  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\), resulting in the partial differential equation \\\\( Lu = 0 \\\\). We investigate the system's response to a mapping defined by \\\\( v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)] \\\\), where \\\\( T \\\\) represents a Fourier transform with respect to the spatial variable \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) and that an intervention was applied, can we definitively identify what type of intervention (\\\\( T \\\\), or \\\\( s(x) \\\\) addition, or both) was made, based on only \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional context or constraints, multiple combinations of interventions can yield the same final state \\\\( v(x,T) \\\\) due to the diverse influences of Fourier transformation and external additions like \\\\( s(x) \\\\). This complicates precise backtracking of the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
