  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. We examine the effects of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under its natural dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be solely determined by the initial form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) alters the starting profile of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), integrating and incorporating the weighted exponential impact of A. This means that the trajectory of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not only dependent on its initial form but also on the complex integral transformation which modifies its path over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
