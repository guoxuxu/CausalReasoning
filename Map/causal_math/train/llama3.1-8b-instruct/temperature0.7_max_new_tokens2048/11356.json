  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real-valued functions of time t, satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations. \\nWe investigate how the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{wt}z\\\\), where w is a complex constant, affects this function over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations (whether \\\\(g(z)\\\\), \\\\(h(z)\\\\), or both) were used, just by knowing the state at time T?",
  "Explanation": "The influence of the complex exponentials through the transformations \\\\(g(z)\\\\) and \\\\(h(z)\\\\) could yield similar states \\\\(z(T)\\\\) from different initial conditions and transformations due to their effect on scaling and rotating. Thus, multiple sequences or types of transformations could result in the same endpoint, making it impossible to identify the specific interventions uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
