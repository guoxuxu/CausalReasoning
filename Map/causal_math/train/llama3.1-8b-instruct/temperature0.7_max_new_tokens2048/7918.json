  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), respectively, with constants a and b. Analyze the behavior of the function after applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be determined after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If unaware of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the rotational effect imposed by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) cannot be discerned from changes due solely to the original differential equations. Without this knowledge, recovering \\\\( z_0 \\\\) solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) leads to ambiguity between multiple potential initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
