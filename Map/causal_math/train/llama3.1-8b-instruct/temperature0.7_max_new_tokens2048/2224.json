  "Problem": "Consider a linear operation in a vector space described by the integral transform \\\\( H(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} h(t) x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is a transformation function. We study the effect of applying a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\) defined by \\\\( D[x(t)] = \\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) \\\\) on the transformed signal.\n\nGiven the final output \\\\( H(D[x(t)]) \\\\), can we exactly determine which operators were applied (\\\\( D \\\\), \\\\( E \\\\), or both), solely based on the output data?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linear and integration properties of the transform \\\\( H \\\\) and the potential overlapping effects of differential operators \\\\( D \\\\) and \\\\( E \\\\), the output does not uniquely specify which operations were applied. The result could stem from various combinations of operations and initial function properties, leading to ambiguity in identifying specific interventions from the output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
