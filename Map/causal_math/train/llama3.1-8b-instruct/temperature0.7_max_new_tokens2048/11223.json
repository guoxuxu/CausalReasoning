  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function describes the evolution of a complex number over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T{[z]} = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to study the cumulative effect over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( z(t) = z(t) e^{-i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) (with \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome of \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\) depend solely on the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( e^{-i\\\\alpha t} \\\\) adds another frequency component to the function, affecting the overall behavior and the result of the transformation. The outcome of \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\) will depend on both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), as their interaction modifies the function’s evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
