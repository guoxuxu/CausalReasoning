  "Problem": "We consider a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We investigate the impact of a transformation \\( h(z) = Mz \\) applied at time t, where M is a transformation matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( h(z) \\), \\( q(z) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential overlap and non-commutative nature of transformation matrices like M and N with the matrix exponential \\( e^{D(t-T)} \\), multiple sequences of interventions could yield the same \\( z(T) \\). This multiplicity prevents unique identification of the specific interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
