  "Problem": "Consider a complex plane where functions are transformed by Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\). We explore how integrating these transformations affects the plane's structures, examining the impact of tweaking the function by a constant linear shift \\\\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\\\) where c is a real number.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( h(t) = K*f(t) + d \\\\) (where \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are constants) at some time after the initial transformation, will the new transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\) still be representative solely of transformations due to properties of \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the original function in both amplitude and offset, leading to a new transform \\\\( H(s) = K*F(s) + \\\\frac{d}{s} \\\\). This transformation incorporates changes not only influenced by the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\) but also by the multiple effects due to the constants \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
