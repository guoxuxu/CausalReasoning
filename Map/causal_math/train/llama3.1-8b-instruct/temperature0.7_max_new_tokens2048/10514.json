  "Problem": "Consider a signal transformation system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ f(t) \\\\} = F(s) \\\\). We investigate the effect of multiplying the original signal by an exponential function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at}g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is the original signal and \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) of a signal \\\\( f(t) = e^{at}g(t) \\\\), can we correctly identify the value of \\\\( a \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional information or constraints about \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or the nature of the original signal \\\\( g(t) \\\\), determining \\\\( a \\\\) solely from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is generally impossible. The transform could be influenced by numerous factors that affect the appearance of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) other than just the exponential multiplication by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
