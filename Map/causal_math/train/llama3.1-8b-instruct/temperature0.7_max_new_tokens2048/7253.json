  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system wherein time-series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a convolution with a kernel function \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The transformed signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(\\\\tau)h(t - \\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). We explore the impact of the Laplace Transform on this convolution and its causal inference under several scenarios.\n\nIf initially data \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is convolved with a kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to form \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and then the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) \\\\) is calculated, does it remain true that applying the Transform property of convolutions results in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of a convolution equals the product of the Laplace Transforms of each function involved. Thus, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(y(t)) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t)) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{L}(h(t)) \\\\) correctly describes the transformation from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( y(t) \\\\) when processed via the convolution with no further modifications or nonlinear effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
