  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time, evolving according to the linear differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\), respectively. A Laplace transform is applied to both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), creating a transformed function \\( Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s) \\).\n\nGiven \\( Z(s) \\) at some s, can we deduce the original functions \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) directly without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The original functions \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) determine the Laplace transforms \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\). Given the structure of the Laplace transform being bijective with respect to the initial conditions under typical conditions (assuming no poles and zeros compensate exactly for the initial conditions), it allows for the recovery of the original values at \\( t = 0 \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
