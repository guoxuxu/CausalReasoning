  "Problem": "Consider a control system characterized by Laplace Transform \\\\( L(s) \\\\) interacting with a complex function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z^2 + az + b} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants. An influence is applied through a Fourier Transform defined by \\\\( G(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\omega^2} \\\\). We are interested in the system's behavior after consecutive transformations.\n\nAfter observing the final state \\\\( J(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain following interventions by both \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we exactly determine which transformations (\\\\( F(z) \\\\) or \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\)) were applied and their respective sequences?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( J(s) \\\\) results from multiple transformations that may not be uniquely decomposable after their application. Particularly, the non-invertible and overlapping effects of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) and \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) contribute to complexities that obfuscate the original sequence and type of transformations applied. Thus, it's not possible to discern exactly which transformations and in what order they were applied from the final observed state alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
