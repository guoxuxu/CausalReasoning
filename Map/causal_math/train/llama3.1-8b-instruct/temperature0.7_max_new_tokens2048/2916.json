  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function transformation on real function space, considering the integral transform \\\\( T(f)(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} f(t) dt \\\\). The analysis focuses on the Fourier transformation of a function \\\\( f(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan we precisely determine which parameter value (\\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)) was in effect before the intervention, based solely on observing the Fourier transform output after the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform result after the intervention provides information only about the current state of the system (post-intervention). The new transformed result loses specific information about the initial conditions (pre-intervention parameter \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)), particularly when only post-intervention data is available.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "a → T(f); T(f) → Fourier transform; Fourier transform → output; a → output; b → output; a → output; b → a; a → f; f → T(f)"
