  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We inspect the effects on the function when it is subjected to a Fourier transformation, given by \\\\( F(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the modified output \\( F(h)(\\xi) \\), can we conclusively trace back and identify the exact form of the intervention \\( h(t) \\), knowing only \\( \\xi \\) at which \\( F(h)(\\xi) \\) peaks?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the modified function due to intervention \\( h(t) \\) results in various components that could be due to multiple potential transformations of the original \\( z(t) \\). Without additional information about the nature of the time modulation \\( t \\cdot z(t) \\), the specific intervention cannot be uniquely identified from the spectral peaks alone, especially if other viable transformations could produce similar frequency shifts or spreads.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
