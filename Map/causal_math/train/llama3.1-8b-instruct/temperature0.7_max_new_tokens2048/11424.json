  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its impact on an integral transform described by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We explore how the Laplace Transform of this function changes under different scenarios.\n\nGiven only the knowledge of the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at some point \\\\( s_1 \\\\), can we accurately determine whether an additional damping factor was introduced at some time point, and its value?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of other factors like the basic frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and their interaction with any damping coefficients means that multiple configurations could yield similar behaviors in the transformed domain. Without specific information on initial conditions or the intervention's nature, conclusively determining the presence and specific value of an additional damping factor based solely on \\\\( Z(s_1) \\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
