  "Problem": "In a control system, the effect of a matrix operator \\\\( P \\\\) on a signal's Fourier transform is examined. Given a signal function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), its Fourier transform at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is denoted by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The operator \\\\( P \\\\) acts on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) to produce \\\\( P(X(\\\\omega)) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\omega^2}X(\\\\omega) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final output, can we conclusively determine the sequence of applications of \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) simply by examining the output after running through \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\) on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) potentially overlap and the composite transformation through \\\\( G(s) \\\\) can yield equivalent outputs for different sequences of applying \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( Q \\\\). Hence, it is not possible to uniquely identify the sequence of interventions just from the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
