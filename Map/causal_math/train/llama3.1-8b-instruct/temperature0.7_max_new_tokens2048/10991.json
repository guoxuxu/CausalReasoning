  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) satisfy the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) - By(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y}(t) = Bx(t) + Ay(t) \\\\), with A and B being constants. Let's examine the effect of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant.\n\nSuppose at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention with another function \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant) is applied, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and B, and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on A, B, C, and D due to the additional transformation by \\\\( k(z) \\\\) affecting the trajectory. Both transformations, \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\), will influence the system's path and, consequently, the state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
