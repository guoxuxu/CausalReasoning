  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and i is the imaginary unit. The function describes a circular motion in the complex plane. A linear transformation by a complex matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function, resulting in \\\\( w(t) = Mz(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven some observations of \\\\( w(T) \\\\), can the exact times and nature of switches between matrices (\\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), or back to \\\\( M \\\\)) be deduced merely through these observations?",
  "Explanation": "Given the potentially complex interference patterns and the general non-uniqueness of matrix effects in complex function transformations, exact times and sequences of matrix switches cannot be uniquely determined from endpoint observations alone. Multiple transformation paths might result in the same or similar observed endpoints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
