  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant real number and the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to this function. The Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nGiven the resultant Laplace transform from the scenario in the previous question, can we precisely backtrack to determine \\\\( w \\\\) and confirm the presence of the intervention \\\\( t^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) and the value of \\\\( w \\\\) can be uniquely determined from the altered Laplace transform, which would include terms derived from the product of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) term with \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\), manifesting as specific polynomial expressions combined with exponential terms in the Laplace transform output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
