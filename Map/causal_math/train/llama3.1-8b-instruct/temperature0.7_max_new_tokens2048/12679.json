  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The system undergoes a transformation through an integral operator \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} f(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( f(s) \\\\) is the input function to the system.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( T[f](T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations (whether \\\\( T[f] \\\\) or \\\\( S[f] \\\\) or both) were used, merely by knowing the output at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed output at time T could be the result of distinctly different combinations of transformation operations and input function modifications. The overlapping effects and the potential for different sequencing in applying \\\\( T[f] \\\\) and \\\\( S[f] \\\\) give rise to multiple plausible scenarios that lead to the same endpoint, making it impossible to determine the interventions with certainty.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
