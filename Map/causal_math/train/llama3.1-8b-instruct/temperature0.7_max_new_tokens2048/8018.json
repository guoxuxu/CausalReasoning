  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), where C is a constant matrix. Analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is also a constant matrix. The transformation occurs over time t concerning an initial state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) requires knowledge about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), as the transformation \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) could alter the initial conditions in a non-reversible way. Without certainty about whether this transformation was applied, the reconstruction of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is ambiguous, particularly if D and C do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
