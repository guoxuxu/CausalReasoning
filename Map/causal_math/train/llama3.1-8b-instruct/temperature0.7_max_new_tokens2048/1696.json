  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) in the complex plane, representing circular motion with unit radius and angular velocity of 1 radian per unit time. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation described by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), particularly focusing on the Laplace transform for different values of the complex variable s.\n\nGiven the new Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) after the frequency shift intervention, can we determine precisely and uniquely the value of the intervention parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) just by analyzing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The shift in frequency directly modifies how the exponentials in the Laplace transform integrate, thereby affecting the poles and zeros of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Analyzing these changes allows for the determination of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), thus identifying the intervention's magnitude precisely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
