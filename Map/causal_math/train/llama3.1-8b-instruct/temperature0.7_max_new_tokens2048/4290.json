  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. We analyze the impact of the transformation given by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) offers insufficient information to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to potential alterations by the rotational factor \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\). The ambiguity arises because the same final state could derive from various rotated initial states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
