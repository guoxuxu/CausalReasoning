  "Problem": "Examine a system governed by Laplace's equation \\\\(\\\\Delta u = 0\\\\) in a domain, with boundary conditions defined by the prescription \\\\(u = g\\\\) on the boundary. An integral transformation \\\\(f(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} u dt\\\\), where A is a constant matrix, is considered over a period [0, T].\n\nCan we ascertain the specific transformations applied (either \\\\(f(u)\\\\), \\\\(g(u)\\\\), or both) based on the observed outcome at T, assuming knowledge of A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects and potential non-commutative nature of the matrix exponentials involved in the integral transformations, it is generally indeterminable from the endpoint at T alone what specific transformations or sequence of transformations were applied. This is further complicated by the generic solution properties of Laplace’s equation whereby many different functions can yield similar transformed results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → T; g → u; u → f(u); f(u) → T; A → f(u); u → g; B → u; f(u) → B"
