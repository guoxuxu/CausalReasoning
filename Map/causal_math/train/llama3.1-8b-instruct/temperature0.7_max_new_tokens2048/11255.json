  "Problem": "We explore a system governed by a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions represented by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant real matrices. We investigate the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( L{z(t)} = F(s) \\\\) on z(t).\n\nIf an additional modifying function \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) during the Laplace transformation process, will the inverse transform that follows still accurately reflect the dynamics governed only by A and B?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( G(s) \\\\) modifies \\\\( F(s) \\\\), and thus the resulting function after the inverse transformation will now reflect alterations introduced by \\\\( G(s) \\\\). The output function attributes will not solely be determined by the matrices A and B but also by the effects of \\\\( G(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → x; A → Ax; B → y; B → By; x → z; y → z; F(s) → L{z(t)}; G(s) → F(s); L{z(t)} → inverse transform; A and B → dynamics governed by A and B"
