  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) represent real parts dependent on a parameter \\\\( t \\\\). The function is subjected to transformation through the Laplace Transform \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), with \\\\( s \\\\) being a complex number.\n\nIf an intervention by modifying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) + w(t) \\\\) (another complex function) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Laplace Transform at s = T still reflect the inherent properties of only the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) changes the function dynamically, causing the Laplace Transform to reflect properties of both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) \\\\). The transformed output at s = T will incorporate effects from the intervention, altering the inherent description captured by the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → z(t); z(t) → u(t); z(t) → v(t); z(t) + w(t) → z(t); t → s; s → L{z(t)}; L{z(t)} → properties of z(t)"
