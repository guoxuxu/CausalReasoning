  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) governed by complex function theory, where \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{iwx} f(x) dx \\\\), and \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a given function. Assess how transformations by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) which acts on \\\\( f(x) \\\\) as \\\\( L[f(x)] = f(ax+b) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants, affect the outcome in terms of the causality and intervention.\n\nGiven the result of the integral transformation \\\\( z(w) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) without knowing if it was transformed by operator \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation effect caused by \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( f(x) \\\\) could influence the integral result in ways that do not uniquely indicate whether the original or transformed function was used, especially without knowledge of constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\). Similar results might be obtained with different initial functions and transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
