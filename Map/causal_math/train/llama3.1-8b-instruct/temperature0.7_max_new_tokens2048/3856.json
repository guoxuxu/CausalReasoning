  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system where the value of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is driven by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = f(z) \\\\), with \\\\( f(z) \\\\) being a nonlinear function of z. The causal influence of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where c is a complex constant, is investigated at different time intervals.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) observed, is it possible to determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( g(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( h(z) \\\\)) were applied at earlier times by only knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the complex and nonlinear interactions between the transformations and the function \\\\( f \\\\), multiple configurations of interventions (either \\\\( g \\\\), \\\\( h \\\\), both, or none) could lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Therefore, it's not feasible to uniquely identify the specific transformations used in the course of the evolution to the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
