  "Problem": "Consider a complex dynamical system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\theta}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is also a constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) shifts the initial phase of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by \\\\( -\\\\theta \\\\), altering the system's trajectory from the get-go. The trajectory will rotate at rate \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but now from a new initial condition, leading to a different phase at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
