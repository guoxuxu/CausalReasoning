  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a capacitor having capacitance C described by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\\\omega^2 q = 0\\\\), where \\\\(q\\\\) is the charge on the capacitor and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. Investigate the transformation of the system state when subjected to an external sinusoidal voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\).\n\nIf the voltage source \\\\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is applied to the circuit at t = 0 and continues indefinitely, will the charge on the capacitor \\\\(q(t)\\\\) for large t only depend on the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "At steady state, the response of the circuit is controlled by its natural frequency and the driving frequency of the voltage source. In this linear system, the charge \\\\(q(t)\\\\) will oscillate with a frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) matching the sinusoidal source, indicating dependence primarily on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
