  "Problem": "Consider a signal processing system where an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) undergoes a transformation using a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(x)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\). This transformed signal is then filtered through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), impacting the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output signal \\\\( y(t) \\\\) after it has been processed, can we precisely determine the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing the nature of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) or the fact that a Fourier Transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge about the transformation and the transfer function, reconstructing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is generally impossible as many different inputs can result in the same output due to the loss of original signal features and phase information caused by both the transformation and filtering.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Input signal x(t) → Fourier Transform F(x)(ω); Fourier Transform F(x)(ω) → Transfer function H(ω); Transfer function H(ω) → Output signal y(t); Input signal x(t) → Output signal y(t)"
