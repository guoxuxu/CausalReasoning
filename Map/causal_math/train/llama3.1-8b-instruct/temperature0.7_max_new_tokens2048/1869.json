  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\) is studied.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and then allows \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to evolve under the original system dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some later time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be identical to its form if \\\\( T \\\\) had not been applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) affects the subsequent behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by changing its trajectory due to the integral transformation's dampening effect, resulting in a modified \\\\( z(t) \\\\) compared to the untransformed system, particularly as \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\) might alter the magnitude and phase of the complex function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
