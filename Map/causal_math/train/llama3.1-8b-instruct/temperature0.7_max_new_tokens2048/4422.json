  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are solutions to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The system undergoes a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{C(t-s)}z(s) ds \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately trace back to the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge about the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) cannot be deduced accurately from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) because the transformation can significantly alter the trajectory in a way that is not reversible solely based on the endpoint data and without detailed information on the function \\\\( e^{C(t-s)} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
