  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical environment where a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) undergoes a transformation through a linear time-invariant system described by its impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\). The system's transfer function is \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is applied.\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies the system's characteristics from \\\\( H(s) \\\\) to \\\\( H'(s) \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at end time T still be solely determined by the initial system's response function \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the characteristics of the system, affecting how the input signal is processed. The output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) thus depends on both the original system \\\\( H(s) \\\\) before time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and the modified system \\\\( H'(s) \\\\) thereafter.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
