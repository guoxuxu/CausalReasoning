  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. The influence of a Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is analyzed over a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) directly after initial conditions are set, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will the Laplace transform at any future time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was allowed to evolve with no initial application of \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( L \\\\) fundamentally affects the entire function over its infinite domain, meaning that the initial application of the Laplace transform alters how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) behaves under the differential equation from the outset. This changes future values irreversibly as \\\\( L \\\\) affects all times \\\\( t \\\\geq 0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
