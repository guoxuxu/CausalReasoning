  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit in which the voltage across a capacitor undergoes a Fourier transformation, defined by \\\\(F(v(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty v(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), where \\\\(v(t)\\\\) is a voltage function of time, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We're analyzing the impact of the operation defined by the transfer function \\\\(H(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + i\\\\omega\\\\tau}\\\\), with a constant \\\\(\\\\tau\\\\).\n\nIf an additional filtering process represented by another transfer function \\\\(G(\\\\omega) = e^{-\\\\omega^2}\\\\) is applied at some time point after the initial effect of \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\), will the final time-domain signal reflect only the impact of \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\) and not \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state of the time-domain signal will be based on the effects of both \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\) and \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\) due to their sequential application. The influence of \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\) is compounded with that of \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\), resulting in a signal that reflects complex interplays of both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
