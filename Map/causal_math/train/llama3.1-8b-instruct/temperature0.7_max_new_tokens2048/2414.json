  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system defined by the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t, z) dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter. We study the impact of an intervention defined by the transformation \\\\( f(t, z) = t^k z \\\\) where k is a real constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( g(z) \\\\) with a specific s, without knowing the form of \\\\( f(t, z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the specific form of \\\\( f(t, z) \\\\) used initially, particularly the power k, the transformation via the integral can lead to various possibilities of original \\\\( z_0 \\\\), making its unique identification from \\\\( g(z) \\\\) infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
