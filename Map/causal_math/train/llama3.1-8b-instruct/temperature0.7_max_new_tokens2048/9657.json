  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\), where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a complex function. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\lambda s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(T) \\\\) directly evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition by integrating the exponential function with \\\\( z(s) \\\\). This integration alters the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), influencing its evolution differently than if it were merely subject to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\). This is due to the non-linear impacts introduced by the integral transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
