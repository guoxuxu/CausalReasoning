  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace Transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) given by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} = F(s) \\). For causal inference, analyze the impacts of altering \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s) + \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) without and with interventions.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is initially \\( F(s) \\) and later modified to \\( F(s) + \\frac{1}{s-a} \\), then allowed to invert to obtain the corresponding time function without further action, will the resulting function \\( f(t) \\) for \\( t > 0 \\) contain an additional exponential term \\( e^{at} \\) compared to the original \\( f(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) to the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) directly corresponds to the addition of an exponential function \\( e^{at} \\) in the time domain according to the properties of the Laplace transform. Therefore, the resulting function \\( f(t) \\) will indeed contain this additional term.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Modification of F(s) → Change in F(s); Change in F(s) → Inversion of F(s); Inversion of F(s) → f(t); \n                    s-a → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → Exponential term; \n                    t > 0 → Exponential term; Exponential term → f(t)"
