  "Problem": "Consider a linear partial differential equation (PDE) governing a field \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) across space \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\), given by \\\\(\\\\partial u / \\\\partial t = L u\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a differential operator. We analyze the behavior of the field under the transformation \\\\(v(x,t) = T[u(x,t)]\\\\) where \\\\(T\\\\) involves applying an integral transformation such as the Laplace transform.\n\nSuppose an intervention applying another transformation \\\\(S[v(x,t)]\\\\) (a Fourier transform) at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\) is executed, will the resulting field \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) rely solely on the differential operator \\\\(L\\\\) and not the transformations \\\\(T\\\\) or \\\\(S\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a new transformation \\\\(S[v(x,t)]\\\\) further alters the progression of the field from its state immediately before \\\\(t_1\\\\). Hence, the ultimate state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) will depend on the interplay between \\\\(L\\\\), \\\\(T\\\\), and \\\\(S\\\\), reflecting the combined effects of the differential operator and both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
