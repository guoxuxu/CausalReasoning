  "Problem": "We consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effects of applying Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) to the system, with its inverse transform typically denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(T)) \\\\), can we uniquely determine \\\\( u(0) \\\\) without additional information on whether a transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Using the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\), we can retrieve \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) under linear operations and assuming initial conditions are preserved. However, accurate reconstruction requires knowledge of the entirety of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) \\\\) over all s.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
