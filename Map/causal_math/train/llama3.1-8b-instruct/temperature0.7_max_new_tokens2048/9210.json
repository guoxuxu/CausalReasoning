  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effect of a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), generating a new function in the s-domain.\n\nGiven the final state in the s-domain after some operations, can we retrieve the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = 0 without any information on the intermediate s-domain operations performed?",
  "Explanation": "The operations in the s-domain can encompass shifts, scaling, and convolution that transformationally modify the underlying function. Without details of these operations, reconstructing the exact original function \\\\(z(0)\\\\) from its state at any time T is not feasible due to potential irreversible transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
