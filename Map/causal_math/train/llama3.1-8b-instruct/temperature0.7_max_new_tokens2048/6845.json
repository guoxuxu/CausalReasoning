  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, D are constants. The system is subjected to a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing a frequency.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the system \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By, \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) changes the initial conditions by rotating the complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane, leading to an evolution path distinct from that of the unaltered initial condition. This modification results in a different state at time T due to the influence of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) on the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
