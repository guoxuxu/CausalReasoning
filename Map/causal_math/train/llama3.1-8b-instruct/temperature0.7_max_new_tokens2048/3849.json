  "Problem": "Examine a scenario where the integral transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\), described by \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt}f(t) dt \\\\), commonly known as the Laplace transform. The function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) describes a physical system's response, and various transformations \\\\( g(x) \\\\) are studied to understand their influence over system behavior.\n\nIf an initial function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and then analyzed under the framework of its inverse Laplace transform without any external influence, will the resulting function post-transformation return precisely to the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is theoretically reversible given perfect conditions and knowledge. Assuming no loss of information or computational errors, applying the inverse Laplace transform to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) should reconstruct the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\), as the transformation is bijective.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "g(x) → integral transformation; integral transformation → g(x) (inverse Laplace transform); f(x) → g(x); g(x) → f(x) (inverse Laplace transform); g(x) → analysis under inverse Laplace transform framework; analysis under inverse Laplace transform framework → f(x)"
