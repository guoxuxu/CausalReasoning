  "Problem": "Investigate the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 z \\\\), where D is the diffusion constant. Consider the effect of applying a transformation using a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), which alters the initial condition by a function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) in the transform space.\n\nIf an intervention using an inverse Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), is applied at a specific time t_1, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 only depend on the original differential equation and not on the effects of previous transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention of applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) modifies the state yet again by potentially restoring or changing the function’s characteristics in the time domain. The final state at T is thus affected by both the original Laplace transform and its inverse, affecting the trajectory post-intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
