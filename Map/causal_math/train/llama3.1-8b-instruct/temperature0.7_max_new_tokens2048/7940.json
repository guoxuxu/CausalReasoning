  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix and z is a complex variable. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation \\\\( \\\\int w(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) on the behavior of the system.\n\nGiven the final state of the function at z = Z, after both an integral and a differential intervention were applied, can we determine which order the interventions were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The differential operation cancels out the effect of the integral transformation, making the final state indistinguishable in terms of the order in which the operations were applied. The function reverts to its original state, obscuring details about the sequence of transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
