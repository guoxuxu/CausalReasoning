  "Problem": "Consider the relationship between a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) and its corresponding Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Here, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively.\n\nIf at some point \\\\( t_0 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) such that \\\\( z(t) = z(t) + w(t) \\\\) where \\\\( w(t) = e^{at} \\\\) (a constant a), how does this intervention alter the original Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds a new component \\\\( w(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which modifies the Laplace Transform from the originally computed \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) to a new transform, which can be represented as \\\\( Z(s) + W(s) \\\\), where \\\\( W(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{e^{at}\\\\} \\\\). The new function \\\\( w(t) \\\\), being an exponential, impacts the transformation significantly, introducing a different domain characteristic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
