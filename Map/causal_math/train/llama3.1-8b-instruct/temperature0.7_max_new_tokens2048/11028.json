  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} x ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) a constant vector. We examine the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt} z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were utilized (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could logically result from different combinations or timings of applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). The transformations can overlap and modify the trajectory in such a manner that multiple intervention paths could lead to the similar endpoint, lacking unique determinacy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
