  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x(t) and y(t) are real functions governed by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), with A, B, C, D being constants, and u a control input. We explore the effects of applying a Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to the function z(t).\n\nIf an additional external function \\\\( v(t) = \\\\alpha e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants) is added to the system as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend only on the original differential equations, not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of v(t) to the system introduces a new influence to the dynamics of x(t) and y(t), which cannot be ignored. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be affected by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) as these constants change the trajectory of the system from time t_1 onward.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
