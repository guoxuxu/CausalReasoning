  "Problem": "Consider the flow behavior of a fluid characterized by the complex function \\\\( w(z) \\\\), where \\\\( w(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\) represents a complex potential in the z-plane. Analyze the effect of a conformal map \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\), where \\\\( f(w) \\\\) is a complex function and evaluate its implications on the fluid flow.\n\nCan we deduce the original fluid flow pattern at t = 0 after observing the new pattern at t = T without knowing whether the conformal map \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the conformal transformation was applied, one cannot uniquely determine whether changes in the flow pattern are a result of natural fluid dynamics evolution or the effect of the transformation. The mapping \\\\( z = e^{f(w)} \\\\) could have significantly altered the initial conditions, complicating backward inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
