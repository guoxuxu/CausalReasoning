  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t satisfying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\\\), and A is a complex number. We analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( Tz = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions (whether \\\\( Tz \\\\), \\\\( Hz \\\\), or both) were used, only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can arise from varying applications of exponential transformations and their superpositions across the same or different parameters B and C. The non-uniqueness in the exponential functions' influence over the integrated interval and their superposition makes it challenging to unwind and precisely identify the interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
