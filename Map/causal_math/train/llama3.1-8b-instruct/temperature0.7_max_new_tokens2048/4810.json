  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function's behavior when subjected to Laplace Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and its transformation into the Laplace domain, defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the implications of altering the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and its effects on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the output \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) with a specific pole location in the Laplace domain, can we precisely infer the exact value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The pole of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) directly indicates the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). Since \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), the imaginary part of the pole position directly gives the value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), allowing a straightforward back-calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
