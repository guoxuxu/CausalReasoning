  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\cdot x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a fixed complex vector, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number. The function governs the time evolution in a complex function space and represents a circular motion in the complex plane. We examine the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T: \\mathbb{C}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(T) = e^{i \\omega T} \\cdot x \\\\), multiple vectors \\\\( x \\\\) could result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the periodic nature of the exponential term, making it impossible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( x \\\\) without knowing the exact initial phase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
