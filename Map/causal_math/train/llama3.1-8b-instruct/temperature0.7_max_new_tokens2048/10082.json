  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\), where L is inductance, R is resistance and E(t) represents a time-dependent electromotive force. Further, suppose that an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by multiplying the current amplitude by a scalar \\\\( k \\\\) is applied, and we explore how this affects the response of the system over time t.\n\nGiven the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we infer the exact initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the operator \\\\( T \\\\) was applied (i.e., the modification by \\\\( k \\\\)), it is impossible to uniquely determine the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\). The current at any time could have been altered by the scalar multiplication, making exact back-calculation to \\\\( I_0 \\\\) uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
