  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) evolving over time under the influence of a linear differential operator \\\\(L[z] = z' + az\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the impact of the transformation \\\\(g(z) = e^{ct}z\\\\) on this system, where \\\\(c\\\\) is another complex constant.\n\nIf we observe the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we infer the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) given that the transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) might have been applied, without additional data about \\\\(c\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the exponential factor \\\\(e^{ct}\\\\) affects the potential derivation of \\\\(z_0\\\\) from \\\\(z(T)\\\\). Without information about \\\\(c\\\\), we cannot uniquely determine whether or how the transformation modified the initial state, as various values of \\\\(c\\\\) could yield the same observed endpoint due to different initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
