  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Mt}z \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being another complex constant matrix, over the time interval \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nAssuming an intervention using another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( N \\\\) is a different complex constant) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), for T > t_1, depend only on \\\\( D \\\\) and not on \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from the interplay between \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and \\\\( D \\\\). Each term contributes complex dynamics through its exponential transformation. As such, the endpoint is influenced by all three factors, reflecting the compounded effect of the original and intervening transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
