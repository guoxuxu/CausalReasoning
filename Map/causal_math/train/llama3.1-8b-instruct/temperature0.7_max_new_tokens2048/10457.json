  "Problem": "In the examination of a physical system governed by the wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\), where c is the wave speed, consider the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) applied to u(x, t) and its properties across time and space.\n\nDoes applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0, and evolving it using the transformation properties over time t, yield the same wave profile at t = T as evolving \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) directly under the wave equation without the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\) evolves in the frequency domain based on the properties of the wave equation, and inverse transforming it back to the spatial domain at any time t = T will yield the same results as directly solving the wave equation in the spatial domain for \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\). The equivalence of the solution methods is maintained due to the linear and reversible nature of the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
