  "Problem": "Consider a function of a complex variable defined as \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\). We analyze how applying a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + b \\\\) (where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants) to the input affects the original function.\n\nAssuming a second transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\) is applied as an intervention after \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and before applying \\\\( f \\\\), does the outcome of \\\\( f \\\\) on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) depend only on the final transformation \\\\( g \\\\) and not on \\\\( h \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations affects the result of \\\\( f \\\\). Since \\\\( z \\\\) is first transformed by \\\\( h \\\\) and then \\\\( g \\\\), the final point passed to \\\\( f \\\\) is \\\\( g(h(z_0)) = c(az_0 + b) + d \\\\), which is different from directly applying only \\\\( g \\\\) or \\\\( h \\\\). Hence, the outcome depends on both transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
