  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az + B\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven only the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we retroactively determine \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing if \\\\(T(z)\\\\) was applied at \\\\(t = 0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of \\\\(T(z)\\\\), there are infinitely many possibilities for \\\\(z_0\\\\) based on different potential choices of \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\). The transformation \\\\(Az + B\\\\) could have configured any number of initial states to reach the same \\\\(z(T)\\\\), especially given the non-invertibility when \\\\(A = 0\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
