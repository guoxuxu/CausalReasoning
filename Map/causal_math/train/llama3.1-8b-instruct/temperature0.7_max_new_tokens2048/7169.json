  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) with variable \\\\(t\\\\) representing time. We study the effects of a transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) and explore causal relationships and interventions in the temporal evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(g(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0 = z(0) = 1\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) initially squares the value at \\\\(t = 0\\\\). This changes the initial condition before natural evolution according to \\\\(e^{it}\\\\), resulting in an altered trajectory where the squaring effect doubles the frequency to \\\\(e^{2it}\\\\). The system thus evolves differently compared to if no transformation were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
