  "Problem": "Assume the behavior of a complex system can be modeled by the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\), where \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state in complex space, and A and C are constant complex matrices. Manipulations on the system are achieved by applying the transformation \\\\(h(z) = Dze^{Bt}\\\\), where D and B are also constant complex matrices.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), is it possible to determine the exact sequence or nature of interventions (such as \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(k(z)\\\\), or both) used throughout [0, T], simply based on the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex interactions and overlying effects of matrix exponential transformations, multiple intervention pathways can lead to the same endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\). This results in an inability to uniquely conclude the specifics of applied interventions based strictly on the end state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
