  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate how transformations defined by the integral transformation \\\\(T[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{\\\\alpha s} f(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with constant \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), affect the function over time t.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\(G[f](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{\\\\beta s} f(s) \\\\, ds\\\\) with a new constant \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final function \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced solely by the original transformation parameters \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and not by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of consecutive transformations introduces complex layering of the original function with different exponential terms. The output at any time T > t_1 will therefore be a result of the interactions among \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), reflecting a composite of all transformations rather than just the original frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
