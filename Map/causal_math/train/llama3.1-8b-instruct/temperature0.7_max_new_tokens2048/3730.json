  "Problem": "Consider the transformation of the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, transformed by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAt} z \\\\) over time t, where A is a real constant. This represents a rotation in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in the complex plane at some time T, can one deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing the value of A?",
  "Explanation": "The effect, \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT} z_0 \\\\), depends critically on A. Without knowledge of A, one cannot determine the angle of rotation and therefore cannot reliably compute the inverse transformation to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
