  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = re^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( r \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants, representing the amplitude and angular frequency respectively. For analysis, a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^T z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\) is used, representing a Fourier transform component.\n\nIf a perturbation \\\\( g(z) = z(t) + \\\\delta e^{i\\\\theta} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) are parameters, is applied at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), will the result of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time T still reflect only the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) adds an additional component to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), potentially at a different frequency or phase. This modification changes the outcome of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), which is sensitive to changes in the amplitude or phase of the components at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The outcome can include contributions from the perturbation, thus not solely reflecting the original frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
