  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and its transformation under the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F \\\\). The Fourier Transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is given by \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) showing a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\), can it be deduced that the original function was modified by a phase shift without knowing what intervention was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The shift in the peak of the spectrum from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\) is indicative of a phase shift intervention. The nature of Fourier Transform in representing frequency changes as shifts in the spectrum allows for deducing the specific type of intervention (a phase shift).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
