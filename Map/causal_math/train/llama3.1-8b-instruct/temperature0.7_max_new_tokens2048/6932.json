  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region undergoing a heat transfer process modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta T + S(x,y,z,t)\\\\), where \\\\(T\\\\) is the temperature, \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(S\\\\) is a source term depending on position and time. An intervention is introduced by applying a transformation \\\\( f(T) = T + \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( T(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(T) \\\\), \\\\( g(T) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( T(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( T(T) \\\\) might be achievable through different combinations of parameters \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\delta\\\\), especially given the overlapping effects of exponential decay terms introduced at different times. This makes it difficult to uniquely identify which transformations were applied based only on the final temperature distribution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
