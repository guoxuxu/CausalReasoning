  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\\\), where M is a matrix representing the linear operator in a complex plane. An operator \\\\( T(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), with N being another constant matrix, is applied to this system.\n\nGiven the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can it be determined unequivocally which interventions (i.e., whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\) or both) occurred based on the final state alone?",
  "Explanation": "It is challenging to nail down exactly which interventions were applied based on the final state alone due to the potential for overlapping effects of matrix exponentials transforming the state space. Different combinations of N and Q could potentially lead to the same observed end state, revealing ambiguities about the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
