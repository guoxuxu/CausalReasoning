  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation of a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We analyze the behavior of this function under an integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L} \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is taken at t = 0 and is allowed to evolve based on its own dynamics without further transformation, will the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at arbitrary time T be predictable just by analyzing its initial Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The initial Laplace transform provides spectral information predominantly about the magnitude and decay rate associated with \\\\( z(t) \\\\) but not direct temporal behavior for all times. As \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) represents a periodic function, its continuous time-domain evolution cannot be thoroughly predicted solely based on its initial Laplace transform without considering the oscillatory nature of \\\\( \\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
