  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform, where the input function is \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and the output function is \\\\(y(t)\\\\) given by \\\\(y(t) = L[x(t)]\\\\) where L represents the Laplace transform operation. We analyze transformations by applying an exponential modifier \\\\(f(x) = e^{-\\sigma t}x(t)\\\\) where \\\\(\\sigma\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x(t)\\\\) (where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\(Y(s)\\\\) depend only on the original Laplace transform L without considering the modifications by \\\\(f\\\\) and \\\\(g\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\(g(x) = e^{kt}x(t)\\\\) introduce additional modifying factors, making the final Laplace transform \\\\(Y(s)\\\\) dependent on the transformations introduced by both \\\\(e^{-\\sigma t}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{kt}\\\\). These exponential operations can scale, shift, or otherwise modify the typical response in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
