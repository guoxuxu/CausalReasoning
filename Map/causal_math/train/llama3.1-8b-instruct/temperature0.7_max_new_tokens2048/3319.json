  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the action of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant and t represents time.\n\nIf an intervention by applying a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real constant) is introduced at time way \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend exclusively on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) remains dependent on all parameters \\\\( \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), as both transformations \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\) scale the magnitude, which influences the overall growth/decay and rotational dynamics of the solution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
