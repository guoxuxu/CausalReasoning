  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transformation applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) described as \\\\( F(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) dt \\\\). We analyze the impact of the modification where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is initially multiplied by a squared modulus of another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), initiating as \\\\( g(t) = |h(t)|^2 f(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform.\n\nIf at some point in the transformation a filter represented by multiplication with \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t^2} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant) is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\), will the resultant spectrum \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) be simply derived from the square modulus \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\) without considering \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t^2} \\\\) introduces another complexity into the system, affecting how \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\) influence the final spectrum. The output depends not only on the properties of \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\) but also on the interaction effects with the filter and the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
