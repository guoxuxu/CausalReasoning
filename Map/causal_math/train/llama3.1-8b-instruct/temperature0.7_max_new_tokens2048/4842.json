  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\\\\) representing a surface in 3D space. We are examining the effect of two transformations: \\\\(T1(u,v) = (u+1, v-1)\\\\) and \\\\(T2(u,v) = (uv, u-v)\\\\) on the initial coordinate point \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\(z(x, y)\\\\) at a transformed point after applying \\\\(T1\\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original point \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) without prior knowledge of the application of \\\\(T1\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\(T1\\\\), inferring the original coordinates \\\\((x_0, y_0)\\\\) from the new point \\\\((x_0 + 1, y_0 - 1)\\\\) and the value of \\\\(z\\\\) is not possible, as multiple points could yield the same \\\\(z\\\\) value and transformations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
