  "Problem": "Consider a system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We examine the effects of modifying the system with a transformation represented by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nAssuming a function \\\\( j(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) (where F is a constant matrix) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on M and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( j(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, causing the final state at \\\\( x(T) \\\\) to rely on D, F, and M. These combined effects of the transformations can alter the system's trajectory such that the endpoint relies on all matrices involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
