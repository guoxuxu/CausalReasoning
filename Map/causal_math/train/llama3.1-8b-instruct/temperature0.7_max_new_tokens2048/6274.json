  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The system's state is transformed by a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), which modifies the state into its frequency domain representation.\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( F(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation to the frequency domain occurred, it is challenging to reconstruct \\\\( u_0 \\\\) accurately. The transformation could have altered the state drastically, making it ambiguous to trace back to \\\\( u_0 \\\\) without this knowledge.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
