  "Problem": "Consider the analysis of an electrical circuit where the input voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is transformed through a Laplace Transform to produce \\\\( V(s) \\\\). The system is defined by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\), and the circuit's response is calculated using the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\cdot V(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a feedback loop characterized by another transfer function \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s+2} \\\\) is introduced into the system at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the output \\\\( V_{out}(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the feedback loop changes the overall system dynamics, incorporating \\\\( G(s) \\\\) into the analysis. Therefore, the output \\\\( V_{out}(t) \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) depends on both \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the added \\\\( G(s) \\\\), affecting the ultimate response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Input voltage V(t) → Laplace Transform → V(s); H(s) → Transfer function; V(s) → Inverse Laplace Transform → Circuit response; V(s) → G(s) → Feedback loop; G(s) → Transfer function; Feedback loop → Circuit response; Circuit response → Output Vout(t)"
