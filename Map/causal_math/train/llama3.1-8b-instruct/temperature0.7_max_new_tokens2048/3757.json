  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. This function represents a simple harmonic motion on the complex plane. We examine the effects of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\), where n is a constant integer, on the function's behavior over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\), and then the function is allowed to evolve under the original definition of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( f(z(t))  \\\\) at time t = T equate to raising \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to the power n?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) applied initially impacts the system by changing the state. However, evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) will yield \\\\( f(z(t)) = (e^{i\\omega t})^n = e^{in\\omega t} \\\\), which matches the outcome of applying \\\\( f \\\\) at a later time T, hence \\\\( f(z(T)) = (e^{i\\omega T})^n = e^{in\\omega T} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
