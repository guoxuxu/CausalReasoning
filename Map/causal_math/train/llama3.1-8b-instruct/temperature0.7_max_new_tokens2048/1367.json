  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = te^{-t} \\\\). We further explore the role of inverse transformations and additional operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1}F(s) \\\\) is implemented as an interventional operation during the process, will the resultant time domain function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) depend only on the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and not on the form of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Implementing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) as \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s+1}F(s) \\\\) corresponds to a convolution of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) with \\\\( e^{-t} \\\\) in the time domain (Laplace of \\\\( e^{-t} \\\\) being \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\)). This modifies the resultant function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) based on both the original function and the nature of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
