  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is an operator. We examine the behavior under the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x, t) dx \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed system state \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier transform is invertible and preserves all necessary information about the function, we can uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) by inverting \\\\( F(u(x,T)) \\\\), regardless of the prior application of the Fourier transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
