  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 \\\\) over a domain \\\\( D \\\\) with a boundary condition \\\\( u = f \\\\) on \\\\( \\\\partial D \\\\). We examine the result of initial transformations using the eigenfunction expansions of \\\\( u \\\\) and how tool-based interventions like Laplacian solvers act.\n\nIf, during the evolution over time, a Laplacian solver is applied as an intervention to enhance solution stability or resolution at a specific time, will the final manifestation of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) depend solely on the natural properties of the operator \\\\( \\\\Delta (u_{xx} + u_{yy}) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplacian solver is designed to manipulate the equation based on \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\), the intervention itself alters how the equation evolves or stabilizes, adding an element that influences the solution further than just the mathematical properties of the original operator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
