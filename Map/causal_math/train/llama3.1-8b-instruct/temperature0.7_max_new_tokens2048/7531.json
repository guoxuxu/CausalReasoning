  "Problem": "Consider the mathematical system where a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves based on the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real number, and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nIf a transformation \\\\( G(z) = z(t) + e^{iBt} \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another frequency, is applied midway in the observation period, will the resultant Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) only reflect the initial frequency \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) at any point adds a new frequency component \\\\( B \\\\) to the system. The resulting Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) \\\\) will subsequently exhibit peaks not only at \\\\( A \\\\) but also distinctly at \\\\( B \\\\), reflecting the composite nature of the signal post-intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
