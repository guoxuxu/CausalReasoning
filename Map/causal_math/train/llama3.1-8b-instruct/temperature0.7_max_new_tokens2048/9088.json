  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) representing a heat distribution over a rod along the spatial variable x and time t, governed by the heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effects of applying a source term \\( S(x,t) \\), which varies along x and t.\n\nKnowing the temperature distribution \\( u(x, T) \\) and that some intervention such as insulation or increased heat source was applied at \\( t_1 \\), can we determine exactly which intervention was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature distribution \\( u(x, T) \\) at time \\( T \\), while dependent on the interventions, does not offer enough information to conclusively distinguish between types of interventions (e.g., insulation versus an increased heat source) since similar thermal profiles might arise from different actions given the boundary conditions and source variations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
