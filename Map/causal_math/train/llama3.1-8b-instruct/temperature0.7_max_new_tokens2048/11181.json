  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and a function \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\). Let's introduce a complex transformation represented by \\\\( p(x) = e^{i \\\\theta}x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant real number. Analyze the behavior of a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) within this framework.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then \\\\( p(x) \\\\) is applied to the result, without any further manipulation, will the final state of the vector be different from directly applying \\\\( p(h(x_0)) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Because matrix multiplication and scalar multiplication are associative, applying \\\\( h(x) \\\\) followed by \\\\( p(x) \\\\) results in the same outcome as the direct application of \\\\( p(h(x_0)) \\\\). Thus, the operations can be rearranged without changing the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
