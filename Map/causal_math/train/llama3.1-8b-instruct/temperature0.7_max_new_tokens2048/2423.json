  "Problem": "Suppose we have a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the integral equation \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} B u(s) \\, ds \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent control function.\n\nIf at time t = t_1 an adjustment \\\\( u(t) = u(t) + v(t) \\\\), where v(t) is another controlled function, is applied, will the system's state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be determined exclusively by the original control function u?",
  "Explanation": "The adjustment by adding v(t) introduces a new component to the control function, changing the integral input to \\\\( e^{A(t-s)} B (u(s) + v(s)) \\\\). This results in a modified state trajectory not solely determined by the original \\\\( u(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
