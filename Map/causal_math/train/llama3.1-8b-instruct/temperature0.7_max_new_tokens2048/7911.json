  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^n \\\\) and n is a non-negative integer. Let's explore how the convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) affects the outcomes, where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf we apply a modification by convoluting \\\\( F(s) \\\\) with another transform \\\\( Q(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{q(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) at some point, and then convoluted the result with \\\\( G(s) \\\\), will \\\\( H(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{H(s)\\\\}(t) \\\\) remain only dependent on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and not \\\\( G(s) \\\\) or \\\\( Q(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final function \\\\( H(t) \\\\) will depend on the transformations and properties of both \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Q(s) \\\\), along with \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Each convolution affects the resultant transform, altering its composition and the corresponding time function via their respective inverse transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
