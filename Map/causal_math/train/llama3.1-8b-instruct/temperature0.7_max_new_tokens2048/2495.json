  "Problem": "Consider a physical system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 u = 0 \\\\) in a region R. An external force is modelled by a function \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\) that modifies the boundary conditions of R at time t = 0. We analyze the effect of this initial condition and subsequent interventions on the solution u(x, y, t) across the domain.\n\nIf an intervention modifies the boundary conditions again at time t1 with a new function \\\\( k(x, y) \\\\), will the solution \\\\( u(x, y, T) \\\\) for T > t1 still depend only on the initial condition \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional intervention at time t1 introduces new boundary conditions which will influence the solution from t1 to T along with the initial conditions set by \\\\( h(x, y) \\\\). The solution at time T is thus dependent on both the initial conditions and the intervening modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
