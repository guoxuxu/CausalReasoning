  "Problem": "Consider a linear differential operator \\\\(L\\\\), and assume we have a function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) that satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(Lu = 0\\\\. We explore how the application of the Laplace transform, defined as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}u(t) dt\\\\), affects the system and the implications of causal inference in this scenario.\n\nDoes applying the Laplace transform to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and solving the transformed equation give the same solution for \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(x, t)\\\\}\\\\) at any time t as if the original PDE was solved without using the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) linearly transforms the PDE into an algebraic equation in the transform space. Solving this transformed equation and then applying the inverse transform will indeed provide the same solution as solving the original PDE directly, given the initial conditions are defined correctly. Thus, the process preserves the output under these operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
