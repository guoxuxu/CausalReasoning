  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} ds \\), which represents a transformation applied to a real domain variable t. Here, s is a complex parameter and we are analyzing the behavior under linear transformations represented by matrix multiplication.\n\nIf an intervention with another matrix transformation \\\\( t = Bt \\\\) is applied at a known time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) be independent of the initial matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the second matrix \\\\( t = Bt \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) imposes a new path, yet the ultimate outcome of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on both A and B matrices. The outcome reflects the integration along a pathway altered twice, where each transformation contributes to the final state, and cannot be isolated from each other.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
