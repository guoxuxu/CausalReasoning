  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving in time according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. The system's evolution is further examined under an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Ps} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\), it is not possible to uniquely backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The integral transformation could have significantly altered the initial conditions in an untraceable manner depending on the characteristics of P.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
