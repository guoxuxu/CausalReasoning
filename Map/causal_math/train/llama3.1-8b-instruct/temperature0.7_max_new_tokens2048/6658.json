  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the time-dependent differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We examine the effect of a Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) acting on this function.\n\nCan we determine the exact initial state \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\\\tilde{z}(s) \\\\) without knowing whether the Laplace transformation was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The inversion of the Laplace transform requires precise knowledge of whether it was applied, as it fundamentally changes the system's representation by translating it into the frequency domain. Missing this information, the initial conditions in the time domain cannot be uniquely retrieved.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
