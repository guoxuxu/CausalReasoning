  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(w) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w(t)\\\\,dt \\\\), known as the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( w(t) \\\\). This transformation modifies how we analyze the behavior of signals and systems in engineering and physics.\n\nIf an additional operation \\\\( w''(t) = f(t) \\\\) (another transformation) is applied to \\\\( w'(t) \\\\) at some point in its timeline, such that \\\\( z(w'') = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w''(t)\\\\,dt \\\\), will the end result depend solely on the original function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) and not on the intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( f(t) \\\\) impacts the final state of the function \\\\( w''(t) \\\\), and thus its Laplace transform. Each transformation alters the function's form and consequently the result of the transform. The initial conditions set by the original function \\\\( w(t) \\\\) are modified by these interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
