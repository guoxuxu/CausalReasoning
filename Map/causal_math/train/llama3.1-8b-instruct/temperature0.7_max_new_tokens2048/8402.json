  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the integral transform \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s^2} h(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is a given real function. We evaluate scenarios where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is modified by transformations such as \\\\( f(h)(s) = h(s) + s^3 \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( h(s) \\\\) at time s = 0 correctly after computing \\\\( z(t) \\\\), without knowing whether \\\\( f(h) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( z(t) \\\\) computed from potentially modified \\\\( h(s) \\\\), we cannot uniquely determine whether the modification (i.e., addition of \\\\( s^3 \\\\)) was included just from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Without knowing the transformation, the original form of \\\\( h(s) \\\\) remains uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
