  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), representing the Laplace transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Let the causality of this transformation be examined considering both linear differential equations and external interventions in the form of multiplicative exponential functions.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant, and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied without any other intervention, will the resulting transform \\\\( h(z(s)) \\\\) be equivalent to direct Laplace transform of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) naturally yields the Laplace transform of the exponential function, which corresponds to \\\\( (sI - A)^{-1} \\\\) when \\\\( s \\\\) is greater than the real part of any eigenvalue of \\\\( A \\\\). This is exactly the result of applying the Laplace transform directly to \\\\( e^{At} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
