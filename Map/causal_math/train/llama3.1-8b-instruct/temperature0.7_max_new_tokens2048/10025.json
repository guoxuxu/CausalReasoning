  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex function, let \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t governed by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. The transformation given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant complex number, is applied to study its influence.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under both \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) with the complex exponential factor \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) modifies both the real and imaginary components of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), hence changing the trajectory of the entire complex function over time. This addition of a complex factor will likely yield a different endpoint for \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any given point T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
