  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), which transforms a time-domain function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into its Laplace Transform domain representative \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Suppose an original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where A is a scalar, and its behavior under perturbation represented by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-Bt}f(t) \\\\), where B is also a scalar.\n\nKnowing the final state Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine precisely the sequence or presence of interventions (whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\), \\\\( h(t) \\\\), or both were applied) based on the value of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output in the Laplace domain, \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-(A-B+C)} \\\\), does not provide sufficient information to uniquely identify whether intervention by \\\\( B \\\\), \\\\( C \\\\), or both occurred. Similar transformations could result in the same combined effect, making it challenging to discern the specifics of the interventions solely based on \\\\( H(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
