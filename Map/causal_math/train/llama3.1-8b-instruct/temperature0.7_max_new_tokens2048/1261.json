  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant and \\\\(i\\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. We examine the effect of a Fourier transformation defined by \\\\(F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is applied and then its Fourier transform \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) is computed without additional changes, will the spectrum \\\\(F(\\\\omega)\\\\) be a delta function centered at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is a delta function centered at \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). This is due to the fundamental property of the Fourier transform of exponential functions, representing pure frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
