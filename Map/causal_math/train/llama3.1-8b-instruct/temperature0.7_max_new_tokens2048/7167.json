  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + bt} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants and \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( t \\\\) are real variables. This function is subjected to a Laplace Transformation over the variable \\\\( t \\\\), resulting in \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - b} \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency domain variable.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), a new complex constant \\\\( c \\\\) is introduced changing the function to \\\\( z(x, t) = e^{ax + ct} \\\\), will the endpoint Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(x, T)\\\\} \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) or will it also depend on \\\\( c \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( c \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the function's dependence on \\\\( t \\\\) from \\\\( b \\\\) to \\\\( c \\\\). Therefore, the new Laplace Transform of the function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\) will reflect this change, resulting in a dependency on \\\\( c \\\\), indicated by \\\\( \\\\frac{e^{ax}}{s - c} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
