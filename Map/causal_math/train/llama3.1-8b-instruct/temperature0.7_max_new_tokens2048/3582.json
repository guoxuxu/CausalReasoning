  "Problem": "Consider a system undergoing complex function transformations governed by \\\\( z(t) = f(z), \\\\) where \\\\( f(z) = ze^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant. We analyze how integral transformations like the Laplace transform affect the trajectory over time.\n\nCan we reverse-engineer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) purely from observing the Laplace transform of the trajectory \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, it's impossible to accurately deduce \\\\( z_0 \\\\) just from the Laplace transform, as the transformation introduces additional complex phase shifts that modify the original trajectory significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
