  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) which evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant, on the function over a time interval is analyzed.\n\nDoes the application of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) alter the outcome if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) continues to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) till a certain time \\\\( T \\\\) without further transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) computes a Laplace transform of the function over the time interval which doesn't interfere with the differential equation governing the function's evolution. The transformation essentially calculates an independent measurement and does not affect how \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to its differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
