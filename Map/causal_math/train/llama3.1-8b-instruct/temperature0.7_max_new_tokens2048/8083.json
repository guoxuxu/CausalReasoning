  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions described by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B as constant matrices. We analyze the behavior under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied, does the ended state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on A and B, and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) as an intervention modifies the ongoing trajectory influenced initially by C. Therefore, the ultimate state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on all matrices A, B, C, and D, as the compositional transformations impact and redirect the dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
