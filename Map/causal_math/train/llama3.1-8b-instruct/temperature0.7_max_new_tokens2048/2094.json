  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a second-order linear differential equation \\\\( y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = 0 \\\\), with p(t) and q(t) being continuous functions of time t. We investigate the effect of a Laplace transformation applied to y(t), specifically looking at the transformed function \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{y(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nFrom observing the transformed function \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) at some later time T, can we accurately and uniquely infer the original initial conditions of y(t) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) incorporates the initial conditions of y(t) in its formation, and since it intrinsically includes these conditions throughout its domain, one can uniquely determine these conditions from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) via appropriate inverse operations and derivations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
