  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = te^{-t} \\\\). We further explore the role of inverse transformations and additional operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the resultant function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) from the scenario above, can we discern whether the intervention was specifically \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1}F(s) \\\\) or some other transformation, solely based on the knowledge of \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), resulting from a convolution in the time domain, cannot uniquely specify whether the convolution was specifically with \\\\( e^{-t} \\\\) or a similar function, as different Laplace transforms can yield similar time domain behaviors under convolution. Additional information about the Laplace domain or specific intervention form is required.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
