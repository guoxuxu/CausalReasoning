  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) defined over complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\). We examine the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-tz} dt \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and then \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is used on the result without further intervention, does \\\\( g(f(z_0)) \\\\) simplify directly to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{z_0^2} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) followed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) results in \\\\( g(z_0^2) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-tz_0^2} dt \\\\). This integral, attributable to the Laplace transform of an exponential decay function, indeed simplifies to \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{z_0^2} \\\\), assuming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) does not include 0 which makes the expression undefined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
