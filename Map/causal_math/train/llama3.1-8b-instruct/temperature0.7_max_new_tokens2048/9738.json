  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the ordinary differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz + Cu\\\\), where D is a matrix representing the system dynamics, and C represents the control input effect. The focus is on examining system behavior with and without the forced input transformation given by function \\\\( h(u) = e^{Fu}u \\\\), where F is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to determine accurately whether the transformation \\\\( h(u) \\\\) was applied to the control input \\\\( u \\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the specific usage or absence of the transformation \\\\( h(u) \\\\), the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to backtrack the exact nature of input due to potential non-linearities and other system responses introduced by \\\\( e^{Fu} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
