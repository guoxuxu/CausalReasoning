  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} e^{zt} dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is a given contour in the complex plane and z is a complex variable. We explore the effect of the contour shift defined by \\\\( \\\\gamma' \\\\) which results from the transformation \\\\( g(t) = t + i \\\\beta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the transformed expression \\\\( F(z) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(t) \\\\) alone, \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely by examining the values of \\\\( F(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific transformations based solely on the endpoint \\\\( F(z) \\\\) is challenging due to the overlap in potential effects caused by different functions and contour modifications. Without explicit information on interventions, it is not feasible to attribute the final form of \\\\( F(z) \\\\) to specific changes in \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
