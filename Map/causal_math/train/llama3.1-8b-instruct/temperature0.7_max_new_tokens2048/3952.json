  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of performing a sequence of linear transformations and then applying a Laplace Transform L on a function g(t), where g(t) = e^(At)x for a constant matrix A and an initial vector x.\n\nGiven L{ŷ(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * Mx for some matrix M, can we determine what the matrix M was or whether it was applied, only by observing L{ŷ(t)}?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing L{ŷ(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * Mx alone cannot uniquely determine M, as multiple matrices M could lead to the same transformation result given different initial vectors x. There is inherent ambiguity in reverse engineering the operator M just from the result of L{ŷ(t)}.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Matrix A → Function g(t); Initial vector x → Function g(t); Laplace Transform L → L{ŷ(t)}; sI - A → (sI - A)^-1; (sI - A)^-1 → L{ŷ(t)}; M → L{ŷ(t)}"
