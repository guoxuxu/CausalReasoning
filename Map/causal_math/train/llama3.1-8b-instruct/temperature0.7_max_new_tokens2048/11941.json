  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is analyzed over the time domain.\n\nKnowing the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) till time \\\\( T \\\\), can the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) be uniquely determined, without knowledge about whether \\\\( T \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of \\\\( T \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely reverse the influence of the convolution with \\\\( e^{C(t-\\\\tau)} \\\\) which could have adjusted \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in multiple ways, depending on C's relationship to A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
