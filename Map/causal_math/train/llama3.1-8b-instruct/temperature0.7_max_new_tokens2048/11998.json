  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) satisfies the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. The complex function transformation \\\\( v(x, t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( w(x, t) = e^{i\\\\beta t}v(x,t) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant) is applied, will the state at time T depend solely on the operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of another transformation introduces further complexity, as \\\\( w(x, t) = e^{i(\\\\omega + \\\\beta) t}u(x,t) \\\\). The resulting state at time T is affected by both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) along with L. The overlay of transformations modifies the influence of L on the eventual state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
