  "Problem": "We explore a physical system where a beam is subjected to various forces over time. The forces are represented as functions of time, \\( f(t) \\), acting at different points on the beam. Fourier transforms of these functions (\\( F(\\omega) \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is the frequency) are used to analyze the system's behavior in the frequency domain. The structural integrity response of the beam, \\( R(\\omega) \\), depends on these inputs.\n\nIf an additional damping force proportional to velocity \\( g(t) = -k\\dot{x} \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant, is introduced at \\( t = t_1 \\), will the frequency response \\( R(\\omega) \\) at \\( \\omega = \\omega_2 \\) for \\( \\omega_2 \\) still primarily reflect the influence of the original \\( f(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a damping force modifies the system dynamics significantly. The new force \\( g(t) \\) alters the system's impulse response, thereby influencing the resultant frequency response \\( R(\\omega) \\). The response at \\( \\omega_2 \\) will now reflect the composite effects of both \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\), redistributing energy across the frequency spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
