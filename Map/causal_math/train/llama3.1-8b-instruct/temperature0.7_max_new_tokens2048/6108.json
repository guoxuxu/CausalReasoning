  "Problem": "We have a LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) system characterized by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\), resulting in \\\\( Lx(t) = y(t) \\\\). In addition, we consider the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{x(t)\\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its inverse transformation applied to \\\\( X(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( y(t) = L(h(t) * x(t)) \\\\) after the convolution intervention, can we determine exactly what the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was, merely from the outputs and knowing the Laplace transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) intertwines its properties with those of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), complicating the extraction of the exact original function just from the system outputs. Even knowing the Laplace transformations were utilised, multiple candidate functions for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) might result in the same output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
