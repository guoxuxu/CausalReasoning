  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents temperature distribution in a material and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To test the effect of a spatial transformation, let's apply a rotation matrix \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) to the spatial coordinates.\n\nGiven the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, y, t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we uniquely determine if a spatial rotation by \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) was applied at t=0 without any other knowledge?",
  "Explanation": "The heat distribution at time \\\\( t \\\\) is a function of both the initial conditions and the diffusive properties of the system. Different initial distributions could evolve into similar distributions at time \\\\( t \\\\) due to symmetry in the diffusion process, making it impossible to uniquely determine the initial rotation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
