  "Problem": "Analyze a mathematical model where an integral transformation \\\\( T(f) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where A and s are scalars indicating the rate constants.\n\nIf observing only the value of \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\), is it possible to recover the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without prior knowledge of whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( T \\\\) is unique, such that knowing \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\) and the fact that it originated from an exponential allows us to uniquely reconstruct \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\), assuming knowledge of A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
