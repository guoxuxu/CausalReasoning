  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z = x + yi\\\\), transitioning through the system defined by \\\\(z' = z^2 + c\\\\), where c is a complex constant. This scenario examines causal inference in system's transformations and their reversibility.\n\nIf an intervention changes the constant c to a new value \\\\(c'\\\\) at a time \\\\(t_1 < T\\\\), will the final state at T only depend on the original parameters and not on the change to \\\\(c'\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constant c to \\\\(c'\\\\) during the evolution alters the trajectory of the complex function, thereby directly influencing the endpoints. The dependency on both initial conditions and intervened conditions means the final state at T depends on \\\\(c'\\\\) as well as the initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
