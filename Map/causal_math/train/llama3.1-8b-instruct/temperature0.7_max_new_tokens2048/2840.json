  "Problem": "Consider a simple harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We analyze the impact of the Fourier transform defined by the function \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}x(t) dt \\\\) on the signal x(t).\n\nKnowing the transformed signal \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) after the intervention, can we determine precisely which intervention was applied (whether \\\\( G(x) \\\\) was used, or a different one)?",
  "Explanation": "Different interventions could result in similar spectrum modifications, especially if they are linear and additive. Without additional information on the specifics of the function modifications or the nature of these interventions, it’s not possible to pinpoint which intervention was used based solely on \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
