  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined in a space, and a transformation given by \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-st} u(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. We will examine how the application of L and T impacts the outcomes over the function space.\n\nIf \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) and then \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is subjected to \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will the result \\\\( L(u) \\\\) at \\\\( x = X \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( L \\\\) was directly applied to \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) at \\\\( x = X \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\), being an integral transform with a kernel \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\), alters the behavior of the function in a specific way that depends on the properties of \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\). When \\\\( L \\\\) is then applied to the transformed function, it operates on this modified version, leading to a different outcome than direct application on \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
