  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We investigate how the application of a convolution transformation defined by kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with its Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system.\n\nGiven \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{(g \\\\ast j)(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) indicating the Laplace transform post-intervention, can we determine whether the original or the intervened kernel was used if only the resulting transform is observed?",
  "Explanation": "Even with the observation of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{(g \\\\ast j)(t)\\\\}(s) = G(s)J(s) \\\\), the individual contributions of \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and \\\\( J(s) \\\\) or any preceding convolution kernel \\\\( H(s) \\\\) cannot be distinctly identified without knowledge of their form prior to the intervention. This leads to ambiguity in determining the specific kernel used based merely on the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
