  "Problem": "Examine a linear system under the transformation \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\) and H is a constant matrix. This system is further affected by the application of a second function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) over time t, where D is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention with function \\\\( q(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on H and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The state at T depends on the interactions among H, D, and F due to their influence on the trajectories of \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\). Since \\\\( q(x) \\\\) translates to another transformation on \\\\( z \\\\) when combined with the effects of D and H, these matrices' properties will collectively determine the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
