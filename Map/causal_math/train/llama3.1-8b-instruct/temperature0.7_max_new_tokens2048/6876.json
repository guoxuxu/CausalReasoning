  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + Kz \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency and K is a complex constant matrix. Let the transformation function be \\\\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) where A is another complex constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions used based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the overlapping influences of the transformations \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) along with the core dynamics. These factors contribute to the non-uniqueness of potential pathways leading to the same endpoint, thus masking the exact interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
