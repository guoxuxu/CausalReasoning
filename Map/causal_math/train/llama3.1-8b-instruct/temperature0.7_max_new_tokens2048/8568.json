  "Problem": "Consider the operation of complex integration along a contour in the complex plane defined by \\\\\n\nKnowing the final value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} g(f(z)) \\\\, dz \\\\) after applying a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and introducing a pole, can we determine exactly what transformations were applied and where the pole was added?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation and the addition of a pole can result in an integral whose value does not uniquely specify the type of pole, its location, or the exact form of the transformation. Different combinations of transformations and poles can yield the same integral value, especially given the complex interactions and potential superposition of effects in complex function integrals.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
