  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral transformation \\\\( Y(s) = L\\{y(t)\\} \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) denotes the Laplace transform. The system is initially influenced by a forcing function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), leading to a transformed version \\\\( H(s) = L\\{h(t)\\} \\\\). We investigate how different operational matrices affect the outcome given by the inverse Laplace transform if applied.\n\nGiven the system output at time \\\\( T \\\\), can the specific operational matrices used (whether \\\\( M(s) \\\\), \\\\( N(s) \\\\), or both) be uniquely identified just from the endpoint value?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint may result from various combinations and interventions of operational matrices due to the properties of convolution and system superposition inherent in Laplace transforms. The specific contributions of \\\\( M(s) \\\\) and \\\\( N(s) \\\\) may be obscured without additional information about the intervening processes; hence, it's impossible to uniquely determine the matrices just from the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
