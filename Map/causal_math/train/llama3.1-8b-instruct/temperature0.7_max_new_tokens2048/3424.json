  "Problem": "Consider a system involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions governed by linear differential equations, and i represents the imaginary unit. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were executed (whether \\\\( f(z), g(z) \\\\), or both), only by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and knowing the functions for x and y?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) may be reached by different sequences or magnitudes of interventions because of the non-uniqueness of the rotational transformations introduced by \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iCt} \\\\). These transformations can overlap or negate each other's effects, making it impossible to identify exactly which transformations were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
