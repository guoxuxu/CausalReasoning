  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. The system undergoes a Fourier transformation \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\), which modifies its spectral components.\n\nGiven \\\\( F(z) \\\\) at a frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), is it possible to exactly recover \\\\( z(0) \\\\), the original state at t = 0, without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While the inverse Fourier transform can theoretically recover \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(z) \\\\), perfect reconstruction of \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from a single frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is not feasible without the complete spectrum. Individual frequency components do not contain all necessary information due to the frequency-domain transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
