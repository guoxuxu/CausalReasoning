  "Problem": "Consider a multi-dimensional complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex initial vector. The function undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without prior knowledge about \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation to \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) encodes information about both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\) but does not allow for their independent identification without additional information. Knowledge of \\\\( A \\\\) is essential since it significantly affects how \\\\( x \\\\) propagates through the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
