  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real scalar constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We examine the changes in the function under different transformations and interventions, especially focusing on transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another real scalar constant.\n\nCan we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is unclear whether the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from direct evolution or evolved from an altered state due to the transformation by \\\\( e^{iBt}z_0 \\\\). This ambiguity prevents the precise determination of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
