  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with complex function mappings characterized by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We examine the effect of the transformation described by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is another constant matrix affecting complex functionalities.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is initially applied to a complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then it evolves under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) without further intervention, will the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) had been evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\) to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) changes the initial conditions by altering the complex vector's phase and magnitude depending on matrix C. As such, the trajectory of the complex function will diverge from that of the untransformed starting point due to the matrix exponential expression \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\), which introduces a unique transformation distinct from \\\\( D \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
