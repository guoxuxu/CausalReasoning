  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a signal in the complex plane. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) converts this time-domain signal into the frequency domain. Analyze the causal impacts of a phase shift transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to the signal.\n\nGiven a final Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we determine precisely whether the transformations \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were applied, and in what sequence?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) shows the cumulative phase shift, but does not provide information on the sequence or individual contributions of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Both transformations affect the phase spectrum uniformly, and without additional temporal information, the individual and sequential effects cannot be uniquely determined from the final Fourier transform alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
