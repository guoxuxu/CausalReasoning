  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{At} x \\), where \\( x \\) is a complex vector and \\( A \\) is a complex square matrix. Evaluate the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( I(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) dt \\), where \\( B \\) is another complex matrix, on this function over a period \\( T \\).\n\nIf a new operator \\( J(z) = e^{Ct}z(t) \\) is applied as an intervention at some \\( t < T \\) and then \\( I(z) \\) is computed, will the result be influenced only by \\( A \\) and not by \\( B \\) or \\( C \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\( J(z) \\) introduces additional influences from \\( C \\) into the system, altering how \\( z(t) \\) evolves subsequently and hence affecting \\( I(z) \\). The endpoint \\( I(z) \\) depends on the interactions between \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\), hence not solely on \\( A \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
