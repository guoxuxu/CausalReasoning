  "Problem": "Suppose we have a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix. Consider the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) where M is a square matrix, at various times.\n\nIf \\\\( T(x) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and it evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) until time T without further intervention, will the vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was simply allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) to time T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( Mx_0 \\\\). The evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) from this new initial condition generally leads to a different state at time T, particularly if M is not a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
