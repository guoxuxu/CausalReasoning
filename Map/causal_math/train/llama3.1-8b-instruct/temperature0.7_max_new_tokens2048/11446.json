  "Problem": "Evaluate the impact of a complex function applied on a simple harmonic oscillator governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} = -\\\\omega^2 x \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) as a constant. A mapping function \\\\( g(x) = e^{i\\\\theta}x \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a real constant and represents phase rotation.\n\nGiven the oscillator's position \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the oscillator's original position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Because the phase alteration by \\\\( g(x) \\\\) can change the initial conditions in a non-trivial manner, knowing just \\\\( x(T) \\\\) doesn't uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\), as the alteration in phase remains unknown.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
