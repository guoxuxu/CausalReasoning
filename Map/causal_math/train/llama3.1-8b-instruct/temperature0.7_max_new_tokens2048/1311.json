  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) in a region \\\\(R\\\\). We study the behavior under a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u)\\\\) and analyze the system's response over a boundary \\\\(S\\\\) conditional on a function \\\\(v = e^{kt} u\\\\).\n\nIf an intervention by applying a transformation \\\\( v = e^{kt} u \\\\) at a specific boundary point and time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), is the final state of \\\\( u \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only dependent on the initial condition set by \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) and not the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( v = e^{kt} u \\\\) changes the boundary condition, introducing a new factor that influences the evolution of \\\\( u \\\\). The final state at \\\\( T \\\\) will depend on both the initial Laplace condition and the exponential intervention due to the change in boundary values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
