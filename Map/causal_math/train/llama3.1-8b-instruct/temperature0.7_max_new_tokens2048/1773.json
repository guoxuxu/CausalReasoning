  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time t according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex number. We analyze the effect of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\( H(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) initially at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state at t = T be equivalent to applying \\\\( H(z) \\\\) after \\\\( z(t) \\\\) has evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( H(z) \\\\) initially modifies the trajectory because the integral will accumulate different values than if the transformation were applied after allowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to evolve. The influence of S on the function's evolution changes the path integral of the function over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
