  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), showing simple harmonic motion in the complex plane, where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant frequency. Let's investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau \\) applied to z(t).\n\nIf an additional damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha \\) is a constant) is introduced at time t = t1, modifying the function to \\\\( z(t) = e^{-\\alpha t}e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), will the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T > t1 reflect only the changes due to \\\\( \\alpha \\) and not \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) adds to the effect of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) on the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T registers effects of both the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and the damping \\\\( \\alpha \\\\), altering its computation and the resulting integral. Both parameters shape the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
