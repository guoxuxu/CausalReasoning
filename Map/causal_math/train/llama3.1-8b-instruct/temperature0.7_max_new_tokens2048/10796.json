  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) representing oscillatory behavior with angular frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). We examine the scenario where we apply a Fourier transform \\\\(F\\\\) to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), thereby transforming the function into the frequency domain.\n\nGiven a transformed signal in the frequency domain after unknown alterations, is it possible to determine the precise manipulations applied in the frequency domain only by observing the time-domain outcome post-inverse Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different frequency-domain manipulations (such as different types of filtering, amplitude adjustments, or phase shifts) could lead to similar alterations in the time-domain signal. Without additional information, it is impossible to precisely back-infer the exact nature of these interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
