  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the complex plane with angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). We analyze the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) on this function.\n\nKnowing the transformed signal \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(\\\\omega) \\\\) and observing a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\), can we determine if the intervention (frequency shift by \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\)) was indeed applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the original signal characteristics and observing a shift in the Fourier transform's peak from \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\omega + \\\\delta \\\\), it implies that the signal was subjected to a frequency shift by \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\). This understanding relies on the known behavior of Fourier transforms under frequency shifting, allowing accurate inference about the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
