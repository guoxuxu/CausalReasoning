  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + az + b \\\\) in the complex plane, where a and b are complex constants. We analyze how the mapping under this function and an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz + d \\\\), where c and d are also complex constants, affect outcomes.\n\nIf a complex value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time t = 0, and then evolves naturally under its own dynamics without further transformations, does the outcome at time T depend solely on the parameters a and b?",
  "Explanation": "Without additional interventions, the state at any time T will solely depend on the initial transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and hence only on the parameters a and b. The complex dynamics post-\\\\( f(z) \\\\) application will trace a trajectory dependent on these parameters.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
