  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact through a Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\( F(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real-valued angular frequency, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time.\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\) for a range of \\\\( \\omega \\\\), can we perfectly reconstruct \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is invertible under proper conditions. Hence, from \\\\( Z(\\omega) \\\\), the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be perfectly reconstructed using the inverse Fourier transform, assuming the transform encompasses all necessary frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
