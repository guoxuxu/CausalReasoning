  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation governed by Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{f(x)\\\\}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x)e^{-ikx} dx \\\\). We study the effect of applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\), which is the multiplication of f(x) by x, and its impact over the transformed function.\n\nGiven the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{g(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\), can we uniquely determine both \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without additional information about whether the multiplication by x was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{g(x)\\\\}(k) \\\\) and not whether it resulted directly from \\\\( f(x) \\\\) or its multiplication by x, we cannot ascertain whether the transform represents \\\\( f(x) \\\\) directly or a transformed version of \\\\( g(x) = x \\\\cdot f(x) \\\\). The form of the original function prior to any transformation remains uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
