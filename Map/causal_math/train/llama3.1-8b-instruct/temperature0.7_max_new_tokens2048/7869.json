  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) applied to a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\), where A is a square matrix. The function is then subjected to a Laplace transform in the context of varying parameters \\\\( s \\\\). We analyze how complex functions and integral transformations relate in the inference of causality.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is initially applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without any intervention and then subjected to a Laplace transform, will the transformation's output solely depend on the matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The result of the Laplace transform not only depends on A but also heavily on the properties of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) itself (e.g., its decay rate, oscillatory components). The relationship between A and the complex dynamics of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) influences the overall output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
