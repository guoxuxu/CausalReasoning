  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of a fluid flow which density ρ at a point (x, y, z) in space varies over time. The flow is defined by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\nabla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) is the velocity field. An intervention is modeled by a transformation \\\\( g(\\\\rho) = \\\\rho \\\\exp(-kt) \\\\), with k being a positive constant.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( h(\\\\rho) = \\\\rho \\\\exp(3kt) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\rho(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the properties of \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) and not on k?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( h(\\\\rho) \\\\) further complicates the evolution by introducing an additional exponential scaling factor, making the final state \\\\( \\\\rho(T) \\\\) dependent not only on the velocity field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v} \\\\) but also heavily influenced by both the first and the second transformations involving k.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
