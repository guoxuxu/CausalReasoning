  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation \\\\( T[u](x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-xt} u(t) dt \\\\) applied to a function u(t). We study how applying another transformation \\\\( S[u](t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) either before or after T affects relations.\n\nIf the function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is directly transformed by \\\\( T[u](x) \\\\) without prior modification, will the outcome \\\\( T[u](x) \\\\) be equal to applying \\\\( S \\\\) first and then \\\\( T \\\\) to \\\\( u(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operations of T and S represent fundamentally different transformations because S is an accumulation operation while T is an exponential decay transformation against u. Applying S alters u significantly by integrating it over its domain first, which changes its behavior in the transformation by T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
