  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant denoting angular frequency. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iws}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely identify the nature of the intervention (either the original trajectory or the altered trajectory with \\\\( c \\\\)) used, based solely on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could result from various complex combinations of the initial condition and interventions. Multiple scenarios involving different values of \\\\( c \\\\) could lead to the same resultant state at \\\\( T \\\\) due to the properties of complex exponential growth and superposition, obscuring the exact intervention nature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
