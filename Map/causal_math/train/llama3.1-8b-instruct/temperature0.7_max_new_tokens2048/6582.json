  "Problem": "Consider a system based on the function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\), where A is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real scalar. We evaluate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( h(z) = Bz \\\\), where B is also a complex matrix, on the variable \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nGiven the evolved state \\\\( z(X) \\\\) at x = X, can we deduce whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) = Bz \\\\) was applied at x = 0, assuming no knowledge of the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The evolved state \\\\( z(X) = e^{Ax}z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( e^{Ax}Bz_0 \\\\) without knowing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) does not provide sufficient information to uniquely determine whether B was applied, especially since multiple matrices or initial conditions could have resulted in the same \\\\( z(X) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
