  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex scalar. A transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{mz}\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(m\\\\) is a complex scalar.\n\nIf \\\\(h(z)\\\\) is applied to \\\\(z_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\) and then evolved under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\(z_0\\\\) under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\) to \\\\(t = T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(z)\\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\(e^{mz_0}\\\\). The evolution under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = sz\\\\) will thus start from a different initial state, and the complex exponential nature of the transformation leads to a different trajectory and endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
