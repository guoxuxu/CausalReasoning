  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( L \\) acting on a function space, defined as \\( L[f](x) = \\int_0^x k(x, t) f(t) dt \\), where \\( k(x, t) \\) is a kernel function. We analyze the impact of a multiplying factor \\( g(x) \\) on the function \\( f(x) \\) before applying the operator.\n\nGiven the final output \\( L[h](x) \\) at \\( x = T \\), can we identify precisely what interventions (multiplying \\( f(x) \\) with \\( g(x) \\) and/or \\( m(x) \\)) occurred, based only on knowing the value of \\( L[h](x) \\) at \\( x = T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The combination of different multiplicative functions \\( g(x) \\) and \\( m(x) \\) and their potentially complex interaction with the kernel \\( k(x, t) \\) means that multiple configurations could yield the same output \\( L[h](x) \\) at \\( x = T \\), obfuscating the precise interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
