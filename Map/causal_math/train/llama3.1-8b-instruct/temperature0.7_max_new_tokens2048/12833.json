  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model of electrical impedance in a circuit as a function of the frequency, described by the complex function \\\\(Z(\\\\omega) = R + \\\\frac{1}{j\\\\omega C} + j\\\\omega L\\\\), where \\\\(R\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) are resistance, capacitance, and inductance respectively, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{Z(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to study the system's response.\n\nKnowing the impedance \\\\(Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) at a specific frequency, can we determine the exact values of \\\\(R\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) without knowing the initial conditions or changes in frequency?",
  "Explanation": "The impedance at a single frequency does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\\\(R\\\\), \\\\(C\\\\), and \\\\(L\\\\) without additional data since these parameters are intertwined in their effects on the impedance.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
