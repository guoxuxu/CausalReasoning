  "Problem": "Assuming a signal processing context where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and subsequently passed through an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[x](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t)dt \\\\).\n\nFrom the transformed signal \\\\( T[x](s) \\\\), can we infer whether the operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied before or after the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the specific nature of \\\\( L \\\\) and how it interacts with \\\\( T \\\\), it is generally impossible to deduce merely from \\\\( T[x](s) \\\\) whether \\\\( L \\\\) was applied before or after \\\\( T \\\\). The transformation operation can mask the effect of \\\\( L \\\\), especially in the absence of distinct commutative properties between them.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
