  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) that governs the temperature distribution in a rod, modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where k is a constant. We consider the impact of an initial condition modification \\\\(u(x, 0) = h(x)\\\\) and the application of a transformation \\\\(u(x, t) = v(x, t) + w(x, t)\\\\), where \\\\(v(x, t)\\\\) solves the original PDE and \\\\(w(x, t)\\\\) is another function introduced as an intervention.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) an intervention modifies the temperature distribution by adding a function \\\\(w(x, t_1)\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, t_1)\\\\), will the final state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 reflect only the properties of the natural heat transport governed by the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\(w(x, t_1)\\\\) alters the path of the system, affecting the subsequent distribution and making the final state dependent not only on the natural properties of the heat equation but also on the characteristics of the intervening function \\\\(w(x, t_1)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
