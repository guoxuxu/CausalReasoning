  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\ = \\ e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the effect of a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at different times.\n\nIf at a certain later time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation matrix \\\\( N \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resultant function form at t = T depend solely on the initial matrix \\\\( M \\\\) applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with a new transformation matrix \\\\( N \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another level of modification. This makes the function form at time T dependent on both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), as the combined effect of both transformations will dictate the resultant function's characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
