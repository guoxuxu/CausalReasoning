  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a nonzero complex constant.\n\nGiven the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2\\\\), can we deduce whether the initial state was transformed by \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) without knowing the value of C?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the scaling factor \\\\( C \\\\), the resulting trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) does not explicitly reveal if a transformation was applied, especially considering the nonlinear influence of the term \\\\( kz^2 \\\\). Different values of \\\\( C \\\\) could result in trajectories that are difficult to distinguish without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
