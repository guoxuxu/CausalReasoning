  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) over a rod of length L is described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) to the initial temperature distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\), and then the system is allowed to evolve according to the heat equation without further intervention, will \\( T(x, t) \\) at time \\( t \\) be equivalently obtained by evolving \\( T(x, 0) \\) directly under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a linear operation and does not alter the inherent properties of the heat equation. The solution to the heat equation in the Fourier domain can be transformed back to give the correct temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\), thus the evolution is consistent whether transformed or not.",
