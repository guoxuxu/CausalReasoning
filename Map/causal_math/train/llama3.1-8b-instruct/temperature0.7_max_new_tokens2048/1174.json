  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the variable \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where A is a real constant. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), with B also a real constant, is applied to study its impact over time.\n\nCan the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from the function after time t if only \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\) is known but not whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The lack of knowledge about the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) obscures the back calculation to \\\\( z_0 \\\\), as the integrated form involving B may have critically altered the time evolution, not derivable purely from observing the final state under \\\\( iAz \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
