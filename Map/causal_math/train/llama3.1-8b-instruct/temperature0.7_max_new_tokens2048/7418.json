  "Problem": "Consider a system ruled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) obeying the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constants. We will explore the system behavior under the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) and the effect of a perturbation function \\\\( \\\\phi(t) = e^{Ct}z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant.\n\nCan the unmodified system's initial state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) be unambiguously determined from the Laplace Transformed variable \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) post-application of \\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\) and subsequent natural evolution?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\) impacts the system by adding an exponential factor, which modifies the trajectory in the complex plane and thus alters the Laplace transform. Without knowing the function \\\\( C \\\\) in \\\\( \\\\phi(t) \\\\), reconstructing the exact original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) solely from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is not possible due to this added complexity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
