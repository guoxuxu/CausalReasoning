  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q\\\\bar{z}\\\\), where P and Q are complex constants, and \\\\(\\\\bar{z}\\\\) is the complex conjugate of z. We investigate the effect of the integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{R(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau\\\\), where R is a constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we precisely identify what interventions were employed (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both), purely by knowing the outcome of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) can potentially occur from different combinations of interventions due to the complex interplay between the transformations \\\\(e^{R(t)}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{S(t)}\\\\). The overlap in possible effects and trajectories leads to ambiguity in discerning the precise sequence or nature of interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
