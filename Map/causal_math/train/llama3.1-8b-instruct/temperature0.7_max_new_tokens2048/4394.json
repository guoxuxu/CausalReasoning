  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), applied to the initial condition \\\\(x_0\\\\), on the evolution of the system over time.\n\nHaving observed the state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t = T, is it possible to deduce with certainty whether the Fourier transform was applied to the initial condition, assuming no other information about the initial conditions or the transform?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying the use of \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(x_0)\\\\) based on the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) alone is not feasible, particularly without further details on the exact nature of L and the original form of \\\\(x_0\\\\). The transformations induced by L could mask the effects of the Fourier transform applied initially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → x(t); x_0 → x(t); x(t) → x(t) at t = T; x_0 → Fourier transform; L → x(t); x_0 → L; L → x(t)"
