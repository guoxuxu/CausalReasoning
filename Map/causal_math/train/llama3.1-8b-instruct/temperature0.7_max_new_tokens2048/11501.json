  "Problem": "Consider a function represented by a complex variable transformation \\\\( w = f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\\\). We explore the effects of this function in the context of integral transformations on the complex plane, specifically using the Cauchy Integral Formula.\n\nDoes the integral \\\\( \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz \\\\) for a simple closed contour \\\\( \\gamma \\\\) enclosing a point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) change if we apply the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) before evaluating the integral?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\\\) alters the integrand to \\\\( \\frac{1/z}{z - z_0} = \\frac{1}{z(z - z_0)} \\\\), which changes the nature and possibly the value of the integral, especially in terms of residues and singularities within the contour.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
