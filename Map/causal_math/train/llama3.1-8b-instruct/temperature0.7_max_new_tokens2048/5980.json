  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{At}x\\\\) where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex square matrix, and \\\\(x\\\\) is a complex initial vector. We explore transformations with the operation \\\\(f(z) = Cz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is observed over time, and the consequences of an intervention through function \\\\(f\\\\) are analyzed.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), is it possible to determine exactly which actions, specifically the application of \\\\(C\\\\), were taken at any point in time before reaching \\\\(T\\\\), solely based on noticing the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could be achievable through various pathways involving different timings and applications of the matrix \\\\(C\\\\) or even multiple applications and additional transformations. The linear character and potential multiple ways to reach the same \\\\(z(T)\\\\) through different sequences of transformations prevent uniquely identifying the interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
