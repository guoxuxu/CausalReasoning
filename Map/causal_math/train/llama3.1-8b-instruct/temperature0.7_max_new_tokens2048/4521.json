  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\) to the function u, and then evolving it under a transformed operator \\\\( \\\\hat{L} \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform changes the domain from time-space to frequency-space, in which the evolution of the system under the operator L is fundamentally altered. The transformed system evolves under \\\\( \\\\hat{L} \\\\), requiring inverse transformation to recover u, and potentially leading to a different u(T) than an untransformed evolution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
