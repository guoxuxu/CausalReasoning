  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The influence of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, is analyzed over time. This transformation modifies the trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( M(z) = cz + d \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 rely solely on the original function parameters and not on the transformations \\\\( L \\\\) or \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both transformations \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), in addition to the original angular frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\). Since these transformations add shifts and scale factors in the complex domain, they collaboratively modify the trajectory and final state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
