  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions solving the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^t e^{C(t-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is analyzed over the time domain.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( S[z] = \\\\int_{t_1}^T e^{D(T-\\\\tau)}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\) is applied where D is another constant matrix, does the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the behaviors of A and B, not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S[z] \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces additional influence through matrix D, affecting the final state alongside the previous effects of A, B, and C. The endpoints are now dependent on the interactions between all these matrices, not solely on the original A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
