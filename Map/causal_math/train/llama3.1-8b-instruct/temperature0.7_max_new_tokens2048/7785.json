  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. We explore the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Bs}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is also a complex constant, on the evolution and behavior of this system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is left to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without any further intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if no transformation had been applied?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alters the flow of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by integrating mediated transformation effects from \\\\( e^{Bs}z(s) \\\\) over time, leading to a distinctly different path from simply evolving under \\\\( e^{At}z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
