  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where z(t) is a complex-valued function, to explore integral transformations. Let's investigate the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a square matrix and x is a constant vector.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) an external linear operator \\\\( G \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), which alters the system to \\\\( z(t) = Ge^{At}x \\\\), will the result of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time T depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( G \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( G \\\\) into the operational system changes the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) fundamentally. The effect of \\\\( G \\\\) cannot be disregarded as it alters the initial dynamics imposed by \\\\( A \\\\), meaning the future state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a product of both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
