  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping operation where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) representing the imaginary unit.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we specifically determine which transformations (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were applied during the evolution, just by examining \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The identical end states in the complex plane can be achieved through various combinations of rotations and scalings due to the different transformation paths and overlaps in complex function mapping, thus making it infeasible to unambiguously ascertain the specific interventions from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
