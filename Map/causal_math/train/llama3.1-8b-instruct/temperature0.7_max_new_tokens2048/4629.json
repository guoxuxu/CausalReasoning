  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = (x(t), y(t)) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The dynamics of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), with \\\\( M \\\\) being a complex matrix. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where \\\\( N \\\\) is also a complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to time T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( h(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) modifies \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( e^{N0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\), and while this seems unchanged, the effect of \\\\( N \\\\) over time affects the state trajectory due to differences in how M and N interact, ultimately leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
