  "Problem": "Analyze a heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, representing heat transfer in a one-dimensional rod. The function \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x)\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is a spatial heat source distribution that varies with position \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(g(u)\\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) without further intervention, will the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(g(u)\\\\) changes the initial condition by adding \\\\(h(x)\\\\). The evolution under the heat equation will now proceed from this altered state, causing the final state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) to be different from what it would have been if evolved directly from \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) due to the influence of the source term h(x).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
