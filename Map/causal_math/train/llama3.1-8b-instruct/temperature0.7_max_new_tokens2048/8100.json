  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( i\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex matrix. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is also a constant complex matrix, on the system over time t.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to unequivocally identify what transformations were utilized (whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) based only on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Diverse combinations of transformations or their timings might yield the same final state due to the nonlinear interactions and non-commutativity of matrix exponentials. This complexity makes it fundamentally difficult to pinpoint the precise interventions applied through observations at T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
