  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the set of complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\), and let's consider an integral transformation of this function, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nIf after applying \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) an additional complex function \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number) is applied, and then the Fourier transform is taken, will the outcome depend only on the original application of \\\\( f \\\\) and not on \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\) introduces a shift that alters the transform's result due to the properties of the Fourier transform, particularly the shift theorem, demonstrating dependence on both applications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
