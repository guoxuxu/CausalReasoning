  "Problem": "We examine the behavior of a function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) defined in the complex plane as \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z^s ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( z \\\\) are complex numbers, and \\\\( t \\\\) is a real parameter representing time.\n\nBy observing the outcome values of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a time T, can we infer the exact values of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at an earlier time?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involved in \\\\( g(z) \\\\) via the integral and exponential terms make it difficult to precisely backtrack and determine earlier values without additional information about how \\\\( z \\\\) and \\\\( s \\\\) interact over the domain of integration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
