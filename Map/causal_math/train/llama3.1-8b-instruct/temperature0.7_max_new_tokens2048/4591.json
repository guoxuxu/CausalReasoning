  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{C\\\\tau}z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nIf a new transformation \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Dt}z(t) dt \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), does the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the differential equation matrices A and B, and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(z) \\\\) adds an additional complexity to the evolution of the state vector \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The cumulative effects of both C and D through their respective integral transformations influence the final state at \\\\( T \\\\), thus making the endpoint dependent on all matrices: A, B, C, and D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
