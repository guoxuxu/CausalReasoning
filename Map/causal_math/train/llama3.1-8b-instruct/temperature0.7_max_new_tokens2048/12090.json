  "Problem": "Let's consider a function space where functions are defined as \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real number. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) on these functions across variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf during the transformation of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), an intervention alters \\\\( x \\\\) according to \\\\( x \\\\rightarrow g(x) \\\\) where \\\\( g \\\\) is a non-linear function, will the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) at a specific \\\\( s \\\\) still depend solely on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by function \\\\( g \\\\) modifies the way in which \\\\( x \\\\) contributes to \\\\( h(x) \\\\), effectively changing the base function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) itself. This leads to a different input to the Laplace transform, hence making its output depend not only on \\\\( A \\\\) but significantly on the nature of the function \\\\( g \\\\). The Laplace transform being sensitive to input changes will reflect this dependency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
