  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We examine the changes introduced by performing a Laplace transformation on \\( z(t) \\), denoted as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\).\n\nIf at a time \\( t_1 \\) an intervention is applied wherein \\( z(t) \\) is multiplied by \\( e^{at} \\) (where \\( a \\) is a constant), will the transformed function \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\) at any \\( s \\) be dependent only on \\( i\\omega \\) and not on \\( a \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention inherently changes the evolution of \\( z(t) \\), and thus the corresponding Laplace transformation will involve terms dependent on both \\( a \\) and \\( i\\omega \\). The multiplication by \\( e^{at} \\) before taking the transformation affects the coefficients and the nature of the exponential terms in \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
