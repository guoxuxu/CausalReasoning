  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of replacing a matrix A in a linear system \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) with a new matrix \\\\(A' = A + B\\\\), where B introduces a perturbation. Let the initial condition be \\\\(x_0\\\\) and consider the effect of operator \\\\(f(x) = e^{Bt}x\\\\) over time.\n\nIf at a given time \\\\(t_1\\\\) within the interval [0, T], an intervention adjusts the matrix to \\\\(A'\\\\), will the state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) still only reflect the influence of A and not the perturbation introduced by B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the dynamical rules governing the system's evolution partway through, introducing effects that depend both on the original matrix A and the perturbation B. The final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) reflects compounded influences of both matrices, thereby affecting the trajectory significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
