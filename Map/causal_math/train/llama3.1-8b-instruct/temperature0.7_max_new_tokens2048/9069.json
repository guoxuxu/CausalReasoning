  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are time-dependent variables described by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), with constant matrices A, B, C, and D. We investigate the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) represented by \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{st} z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf the integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) at t = 0, and the system is then allowed to evolve according to its differential equations without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some later time T be the same as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was directly evolved to time T under its original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transform \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the system by integrating the influence of the complex exponential and the initial state over time, hence altering the trajectory of the system. The original system's dynamics and the transform do not commute, affecting the system state at later times differently.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
