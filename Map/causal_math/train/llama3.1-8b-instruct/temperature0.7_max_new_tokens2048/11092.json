  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modelled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where c is a speed constant. Study the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(t,x)) \\\\) on the spatial variable.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed state at time T, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(T,x)) \\\\), can we determine if an intervention like damping (\\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\)) was applied, solely based on this transformed information?",
  "Explanation": "The changes in the amplitude and phase of the frequency components due to damping can resemble those arising from initial conditions or interactions not modeled by the simple wave equation. Without additional information, these effects are indistinguishable in the Fourier domain, hence we cannot uniquely determine if or what intervention was used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
