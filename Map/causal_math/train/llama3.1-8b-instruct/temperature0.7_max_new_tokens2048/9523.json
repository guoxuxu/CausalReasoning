  "Problem": "In a fluid dynamics context, we consider the temperature distribution \\\\( T(x,t) \\\\) governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. To study the effect of a varying thermal diffusivity, a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modulates \\\\( k \\\\) as \\\\( k(t) = k_0 h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( k_0 \\\\) being the initial thermal diffusivity.\n\nIf a control strategy introduces a sudden change in \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to a step function, will the final temperature profile \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\), for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\), reflect only the new condition imposed by the step function?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature profile at any point depends on the entire history of the thermal diffusivity. A sudden change in \\\\( h(t) \\\\) will affect the distribution from the intervention point onward, but the earlier modulation and conditions still influence the overall distribution at time \\\\( T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
