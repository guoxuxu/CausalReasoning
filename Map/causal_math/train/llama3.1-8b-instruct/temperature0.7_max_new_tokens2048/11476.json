  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) as a signal through a linear system described by the transform \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} e^{-ix}z(x)dx \\\\). We explore the causal inference ability by analyzing the system's response using advanced calculus and integral transformations.\n\nCan we precisely identify if a modulation function \\\\( m(t) \\\\) was applied before the transformation and determine its form, just by analyzing the output \\\\( T(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the inherent properties of integral transforms and possible equivalence in outcomes from different initial functions or modulation applications, it's impossible to uniquely backtrack and determine the precise characteristics or existence of the intervention function \\\\( m(t) \\\\) based only on \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
