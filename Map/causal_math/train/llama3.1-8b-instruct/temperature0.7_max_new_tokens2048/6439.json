  "Problem": "Consider a system where a temperature field T is modeled by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\Delta T\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\(\\\\Delta\\\\) is the Laplace operator. We investigate the influence of a transformation defined by \\\\( f(T) = T + h(x,t) \\\\), with \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) being a heat source function varying in space and time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(T) = T - k(x,t) \\\\) (where \\\\(k(x,t)\\\\) is a cooling function varying in space and time) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( T(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the initial PDE parameters and not on \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) or \\\\(k(x,t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(T) \\\\) introduces another modifying factor, making the final state \\\\( T(T) \\\\) dependent on both \\\\(h(x,t)\\\\) and \\\\(k(x,t)\\\\), as well as the thermal diffusivity \\\\(k\\\\). The transformations add and subtract heat, affecting the system’s trajectory and the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
