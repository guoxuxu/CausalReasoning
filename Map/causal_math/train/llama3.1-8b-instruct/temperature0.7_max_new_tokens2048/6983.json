  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} x_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( x_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. This system undergoes an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x t} f(t) dt \\\\), and we explore the influence of this transformation on the system's behavior.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new operation \\\\( R[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{- \\\\pi i x t} f(t) dt \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 be exclusively dependent on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not on the effects of \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( R \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity through its unique Fourier transformation properties. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by both the original dynamics (determined by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)) and the changes induced by \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\), making it dependent on these transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
