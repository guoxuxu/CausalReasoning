  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex system behavior given by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-\\\\tau)A} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is the input of the system.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we infer the specific function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) throughout the interval [0, T] without further information about the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The inference of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( A \\\\) is generally not possible as the transformation \\\\( e^{(t-\\\\tau)A} \\\\) involves the matrix exponential which integrates the influence of \\\\( x(\\\\tau) \\\\) over time. Lack of information about \\\\( A \\\\) obscures the effect of input on the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
