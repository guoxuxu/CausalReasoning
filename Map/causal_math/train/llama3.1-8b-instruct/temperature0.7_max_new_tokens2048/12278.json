  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by the differential equation \\\\( V' = -RCV \\\\), where V is the voltage, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance in the circuit. Analyze the impact of the Laplace Transform, defined by the function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V(t)) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}V(t) dt \\\\) over the time domain variable t, where s is a complex number.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a transformation \\\\( V(t) = V(t)e^{-at} \\\\) is applied as an intervention (where a is a constant), will the transformed endpoint \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(V(T)) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on initial conditions encoded by R and C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the decay characteristics of the voltage, influencing not just the scale but potentially changing the nature of the response depending on the interaction between the exponential decay factor a and RC circuit characteristics. The transformed voltage at any point is thus contingent on a, as well as R and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
