  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 v = 0\\\\) in a domain \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). Assess the effect of the boundary condition alteration defined through \\\\( v' = v + h \\\\) on the boundary \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\), where \\\\(h\\\\) is a known function defined on \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\).\n\nGiven the solution \\\\(v'(x)\\\\) to the Laplace equation under modified boundary conditions \\\\(v' = v + h\\\\), can one determine the original boundary conditions \\\\(v\\\\) on \\\\(\\\\Gamma\\\\) without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Without extra data distinguishing between the influence of \\\\(v\\\\) and \\\\(h\\\\) in forming \\\\(v'\\\\), one cannot uniquely derive \\\\(v\\\\) from observing only \\\\(v'(x)\\\\). The problem lacks sufficiency to backtrack only using the information of the modified solution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
