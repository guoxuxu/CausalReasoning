  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a response function represented by the Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants. A signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\) is input into the system, and its Laplace transform is \\\\( X(s) \\\\). The output of the system, \\\\( y(t) \\\\), is given by the inverse Laplace transform of the product \\\\( H(s)X(s) \\\\).\n\nCan the presence of the specific intervention (\\\\( \\\\delta(s) - s \\\\)) be determined solely by analyzing \\\\( y(T) \\\\) when T is significantly greater than \\\\( t_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the impulse or any specific intervention may not be uniquely identifiable in the output due to potential overlapping or similar effects caused by different interventions or initial conditions. Additionally, without knowing the exact nature of every possible intervention and initial input, tracing back to the specific intervention from the end result becomes theoretically and practically challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
