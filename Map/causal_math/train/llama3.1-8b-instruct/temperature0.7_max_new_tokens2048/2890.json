  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Jt}z \\\\) over time t, where J is a complex constant.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the system's modification by \\\\( e^{Jt} \\\\) obscures the initial state, making it hard to uniquely ascertain whether the observed state at time T is a result of the transformation or the evolution from a potentially different initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
