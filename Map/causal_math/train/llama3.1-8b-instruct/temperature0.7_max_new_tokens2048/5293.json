  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a signal in the context of Fourier Transform, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The ability of the system to represent different frequency components is evaluated.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will the resulting spectrum concentrate its energy at the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform of \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is a delta function centered at \\\\( \\omega \\\\). This indicates a concentration of all the signal's energy at that particular frequency, accurately reflecting its singular frequency component.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
