  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) describing a dynamical system's behavior in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and solve the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with A, B, C, and D as constants. We investigate the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number, modifying the function's phase.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can it be conclusively determined whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "Since the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) only modifies the initial phase and the system's equations involve both real and imaginary components that could have naturally evolved to the same state from different initial conditions, it is not possible to uniquely determine whether the phase was altered by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at the outset without knowing the exact initial state.",
