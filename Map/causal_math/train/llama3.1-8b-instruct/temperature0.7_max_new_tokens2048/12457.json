  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real frequency. We examine the effect of an integral transformation defined by the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of the function over time t.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a function, can it be uniquely used to determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the original function?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming convergence and proper conditions, the inverse Laplace Transform of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) will uniquely determine \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The transformation encodes all necessary information about the original function within its domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
