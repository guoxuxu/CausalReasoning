  "Problem": "Examine a continuous mathematical model using a Fourier transform, where a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) representing a signal is transformed into a frequency domain represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The causal properties of the system are influenced when a filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) = e^{-a\\\\omega^2} \\\\), with a real constant \\\\( a \\\\), is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) affects the attenuation of the signal's components depending on their frequency.\n\nGiven only the final state of the signal in the time domain after all transformations, can we accurately determine which modifications (the usage of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) or \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), or both) were applied during the transformation process?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the application of specific transformations based solely on the final signal in the time domain is challenging due to the compounding impact of consecutive transformations in the frequency domain and the potential for overlapping effects, which can mask the individual impacts of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\). Without additional contextual information or constraints, accurately pinpointing the transformations is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
