  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation of a complex function defined by \\\\( F(z) = z^2 \\\\) in the complex plane. We examine the impact of a Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied on functions derived from \\\\( F \\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\), can we deduce the exact original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without information about its transformation through \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) requires knowledge of the transformation \\\\( F(z) = z^2 \\\\). Without this information, multiple values of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) (specifically, any complex square roots of the deduced parameter) could correspond to the observed Laplace transform result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
