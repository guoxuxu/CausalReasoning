  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function is subject to transformations using Fourier transforms over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\) is obtained at time t = 0, and the system is evolved over time without any external influences, will the inverse Fourier transform at any later time T yield the original function \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform and its inverse are linear operations that perfectly reconstruct the original signal in the absence of any modifications or additional transformations. Therefore, evolving the system over time without any interference will allow the retrieval of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) as \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega T} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
