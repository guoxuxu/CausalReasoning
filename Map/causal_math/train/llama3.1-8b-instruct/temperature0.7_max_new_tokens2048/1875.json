  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Pu\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) is a differential operator. Investigate how the introduction of a boundary condition using the function \\\\(h(u) = e^{Qt}u\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is another differential operator, affects the system.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), another boundary condition \\\\(k(u) = e^{Rt}u\\\\) (where \\\\(R\\\\) is a constant differential operator) is applied as an intervention, is the state \\\\(u(T)\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) determined solely by the action of \\\\(P\\\\) and not influenced by \\\\(Q\\\\) or \\\\(R\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(k(u)\\\\) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a new modification, impacting the trajectory and final state \\\\(u(T)\\\\). The entire evolution including and beyond \\\\(t_1\\\\) will depend on the interplay between \\\\(P\\\\), \\\\(Q\\\\), and \\\\(R\\\\), as the different operators can lead to diverse effects on the solution path of the partial differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
