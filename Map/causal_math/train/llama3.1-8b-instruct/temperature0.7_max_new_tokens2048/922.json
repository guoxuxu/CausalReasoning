  "Problem": "Consider a system where stock prices are modeled by a stochastic differential equation \\\\(dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW)\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\) representing the drift and volatility parameters, respectively. We further consider the impact of an economic policy intervention which can be modeled by an exponential adjustment factor \\\\(f(S) = e^{\\\\alpha t}S\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the stock price at time \\\\(T\\\\), can we deduce the initial price \\\\(S_0\\\\) at time \\\\(0\\\\) without knowing whether the economic policy intervention \\\\(f(S)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the exponential adjustment factor \\\\(e^{\\\\alpha t}\\\\) on the initial condition could substantially alter the trajectory of the stock price. Without knowing if this intervention was applied, it's impossible to accurately back-calculate to \\\\(S_0\\\\) as multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed outcome due to the stochastic nature of the process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

The volatility parameter σ directly influences the stock price S_T. The economic policy intervention constant α directly influences the exponential adjustment factor f(S).
