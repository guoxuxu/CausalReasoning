  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined on real numbers, and its Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(h)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Analyze the scenario where modification is performed by another function \\\\( p(x) = e^{-ax^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the final Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(s)(\\\\omega) \\\\), can we exactly determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( p(x) \\\\), \\\\( r(x) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(s)(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of Gaussian functions in the Fourier transform (specifically their convolution resulting in summation of exponents), it is challenging to uniquely identify and separate the effects of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( r(x) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(s)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Decomposing the combined effect into individual components is non-trivial without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
