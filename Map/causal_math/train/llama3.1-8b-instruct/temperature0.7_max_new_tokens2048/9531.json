  "Problem": "Consider a complex domain function \\\\(z(t) = Re^{i\\\\theta(t)}\\\\) where \\\\(R\\\\) is a constant radial distance and \\\\(\\\\theta(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent angle. We explore the transformation under the matrix \\\\(M(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) & -\\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) & \\\\cos(\\\\omega t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\) representing a rotation by \\\\(\\\\omega t\\\\).\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention using a different rotation matrix \\\\( N(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\beta t) & -\\\\sin(\\\\beta t) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\beta t) & \\\\cos(\\\\beta t) \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\) is applied, will the end position at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be dependent only on the original function and not on \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions shift the angle not only by the original rotation \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) but also by the secondary rotation \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), impacting the final state considerably. Hence, the output depends on both angles, affecting the trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
