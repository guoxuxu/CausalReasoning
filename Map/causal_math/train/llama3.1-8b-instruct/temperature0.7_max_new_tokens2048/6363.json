  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop feedback system described by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Kx + Lu \\\\), where \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) is the control input. We are examining the system's behavior under the integral transformation given by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{(K+L)s} ds \\\\cdot x \\\\).\n\nIf intervention by transformation \\\\( S(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t_1} e^{M s} ds \\\\cdot x \\\\) (where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), is the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) solely dependent on \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\) but not on \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation \\\\( S(x) \\\\) potentially adds an overlay of integration involving \\\\( M \\\\), affecting the trajectory and final state at time \\\\( T \\\\). Consequently, the state of the system at \\\\( T \\\\) becomes dependent on \\\\( M \\\\), in addition to \\\\( K \\\\) and \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
