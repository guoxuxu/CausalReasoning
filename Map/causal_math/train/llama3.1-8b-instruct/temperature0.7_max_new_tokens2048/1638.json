  "Problem": "Consider a system where the rate of heat transfer \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature distribution along the rod. A transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h \\\\), where h is a constant heating term, is applied to the rod's temperature distribution.\n\nCan the original temperature distribution at t = 0 be uniquely determined after observing the temperature distribution at a later time t without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h \\\\) was applied, the observed temperature distribution at time t could be a consequence of multiple initial distributions, affected either by the heat equation alone or modified by the constant h.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
