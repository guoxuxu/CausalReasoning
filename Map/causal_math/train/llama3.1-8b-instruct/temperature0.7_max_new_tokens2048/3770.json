  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and let's introduce an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s} f(s) \\\\, ds \\\\). We explore how this transformation affects the function over time through different causal pathways and interventions.\n\nIf given the result of \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval [0, T] without prior knowledge of the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation obscures the history of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) through its integral effect, accumulating all prior values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) weighted by \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega s} \\\\). Without knowing the nature of these transformations, retracing to the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval is indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
