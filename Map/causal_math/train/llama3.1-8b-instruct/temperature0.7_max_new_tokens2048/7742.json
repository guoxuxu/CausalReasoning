  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = pz + q \\\\), where p and q are complex constants. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) (where k is a positive integer) and its influence on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied, any observed value at time T could correspond to numerous initial values, considering each possible iteration of k. The lack of this transformative context prevents the definitive tracing back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
