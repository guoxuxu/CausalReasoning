  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We examine the influence of an external heat source \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\) modeled by the transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + q(x,t) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) and allowed to evolve under \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at a later time T be the same as if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was directly evolved to time T under \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(u) \\\\) modifies the initial temperature distribution by adding \\\\( q(x,0) \\\\). This modifies the initial conditions of the heat equation, thus altering the temperature distribution at time T from what would have been obtained had \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) been evolved without the addition of \\\\( q(x,t) \\\\). The heat evolution is sensitive to initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
