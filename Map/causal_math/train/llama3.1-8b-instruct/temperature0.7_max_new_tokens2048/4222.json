  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) under the transformation \\\\(h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant. We assume \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are governed by differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\), where A is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T without knowing if transformation \\\\(h(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(h(z)\\\\), it is unclear whether the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\) resulted from a transformation related phase-shift or solely from the evolution under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ay\\\\). The phase factor \\\\(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) could have altered the state in ways that cannot be easily disentangled without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
