  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\\\), where a is a constant. We explore the effect of applying the Fourier transform to this equation over space and assessing its implication under different integration transformations.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) undergoes a Fourier transform, and then the PDE evolves from t = 0 to t = T without additional transformations, does the solution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) depend solely on the initial Fourier transformed data?",
  "Explanation": "The evolution described by the PDE in the Fourier domain translates the transformed data through multiplication by \\\\( e^{-iakT} \\\\), where k is the frequency variable. The solution at any time T can be determined directly from the Fourier transformed initial data through inverse Fourier transformation of \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
