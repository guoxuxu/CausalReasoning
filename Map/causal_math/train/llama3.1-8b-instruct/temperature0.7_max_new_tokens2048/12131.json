  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by a set of coupled differential equations. Analyze the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t u(s) ds \\\\) where \\\\( u(s) \\\\) is a complex function.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T1) \\\\), can the specific integrative interventions used (both \\\\( u(s) \\\\) and \\\\( v(s) \\\\)), be precisely identified, just by knowing \\\\( z(T1) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state could result from various combinations of transformations \\\\( u(s) \\\\) and \\\\( v(s) \\\\), and their specific effects could overlap, creating ambiguity in reverse-engineering the interventions. Different parameters or functions for \\\\( u(s) \\\\) and \\\\( v(s) \\\\) could potentially result in the same final state at T1, making it impractical to determine the specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
