  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyse the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}z \\\\, dt \\\\), where N is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}z \\\\, dt \\\\) (where Q is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on M and not on N or Q?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another layer of transformation through the integral of another matrix exponential. This makes the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on M, N, and Q, as the transformations do not simply add linearly but interact through their respective effects on the trajectory of the complex function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
