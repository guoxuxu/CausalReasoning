  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the frequency domain, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is then transformed by the integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), taking place over a duration T.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined as above and then transformed by \\\\( T[z] \\\\) without further intervention, will the outcome of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) be zero for any \\\\( T \\\\) not equal to multiples of \\\\( \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\omega} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and without intervention, the integral transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) over a period not equal to a multiple of \\\\( \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\omega} \\\\) results in a complete cycle (or cycles), which mathematically cancels out, leading to zero due to the orthogonality over the integral of one complete period of a sinusoid.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
