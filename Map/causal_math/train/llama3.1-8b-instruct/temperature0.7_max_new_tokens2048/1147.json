  "Problem": "Assume the function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + 1 \\\\) is initially transformed by applying \\\\( h(z) = e^z \\\\). We examine how this transformation impacts the integration over a continuous function under different operational conditions.\n\nIf another function transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\ln(z) \\\\) is applied as an intervention during integration, will the final integral from x = 0 to 2 depend solely on the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\), disregarding the transformations \\\\( h \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( g(z) = \\ln(z) \\\\) as an intervention after applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) leads to the integral of the nested functions \\\\( \\ln(e^{x^2 + 1}) \\\\), which simplifies to \\\\( x^2 + 1 \\\\). However, this resultant function still depends on the initial transformation by \\\\( h \\\\), showing the dependency is not solely on \\\\( z(x) \\\\).",
