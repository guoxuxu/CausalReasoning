  "Problem": "Analyze a heat equation \\\\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\\\) where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, representing heat transfer in a one-dimensional rod. The function \\\\(g(u) = u + h(x)\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(h(x)\\\\) is a spatial heat source distribution that varies with position \\\\(x\\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(g(u)\\\\), \\\\(j(u)\\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome at point \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) could be achievable through various combinations of interventions and respective durations, alongside natural evolution under the heat equation. Without additional context or constraints, multiple scenarios could lead to the same observed endpoint, due to the superposition principle of linear equations like the stated heat equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
