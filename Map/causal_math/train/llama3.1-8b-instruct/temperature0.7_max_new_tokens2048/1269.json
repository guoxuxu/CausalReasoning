  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined as the solution to the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz + k\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We are investigating scenarios where an integral transformation \\\\(w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} z(s) ds\\\\) is applied, with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant matrix.\n\nIf the complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves naturally according to its differential equation with initial condition \\\\(z(0) = z_0\\\\), will the transformed function \\\\(w(T)\\\\) at time T necessarily reflect the direct effect of the differential equation on \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without considering the impact of matrix \\\\(A\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation involves the matrix exponent \\\\(e^{sA}\\\\), which modifies the impact of \\\\(z(s)\\\\) during integration. This additional factor means that \\\\(w(T)\\\\) does not simply reflect the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) under the differential equation; it is also shaped by the influence of \\\\(A\\\\).",
