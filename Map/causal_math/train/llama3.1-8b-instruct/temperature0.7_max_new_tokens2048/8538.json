  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) that solves the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. An integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) with kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\).\n\nIf we only observe the solution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at some time \\\\( t \\\\), can we determine whether the initial condition was transformed by \\\\( T \\\\) without knowing the transformation explicitly?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the integral transform \\\\( T \\\\), or its kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely reverse the operation to confirm if the transformation was applied on \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\). The induced changes by \\\\( T \\\\) are generally merged and diffused through the time evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
