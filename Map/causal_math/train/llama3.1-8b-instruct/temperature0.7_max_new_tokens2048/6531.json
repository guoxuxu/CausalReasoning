  "Problem": "Analyze a feedback system involving the complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{1 - cz} \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to the initial input \\\\( z_0 \\\\), and is continuously re-applied to its own output in a feedback loop. Additionally, explore how the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) influences the system over time.\n\nSuppose an external stable transformation \\\\( g(z) = cz \\\\) (\\(|c|<1\\)) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), interrupting and then replacing the feedback cycle, will the system's end behavior at time \\\\( t \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\) still solely be determined by the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new transformation function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory of the system. Assuming the original and new transformations do not share fixed points or have particular symmetrical properties, the resultant state of the system at \\\\( t \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\) will reflect the influence of both \\\\( f \\\\) and \\\\( g \\\\). This interplay can potentially lead to a different limit state or even alter stability characteristics, depending on the nature of \\\\( c \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
