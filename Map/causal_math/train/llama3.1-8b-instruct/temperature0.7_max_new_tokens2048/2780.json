  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = z^k\\\\) on the complex plane, and we are studying its transformation through a complex contour integral \\\\(I(t) = \\\\oint_C e^{tz} u(z) dz\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple, closed contour and \\\\(t\\\\) is a real number.\n\nKnowing the outcome of \\\\(I''(t)\\\\), can we uniquely determine if the adjustment function \\\\( g(t) = t^a \\\\) was applied or if the power \\\\(k\\\\) in \\\\(u(z)\\\\) was altered, solely based on the value of \\\\(I''(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of the power \\\\(k\\\\) and the adjustment exponent \\\\(a\\\\) can lead to similar or even identical outcomes in the integral, particularly due to the complex interplay between the exponential growth factor and the polynomial nature of \\\\(u(z)\\\\). Determining which specific alterations were made based exclusively on \\\\(I''(t)\\\\) is therefore not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
