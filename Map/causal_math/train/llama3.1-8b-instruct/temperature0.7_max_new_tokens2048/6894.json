  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions derived from the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t=0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Absent confirmation of the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's indeterminable if the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) resulted from the direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or from an altered state due to \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Since C might not commute with A or B, reversing the transformation effects exactly is uncertain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
