  "Problem": "Consider a linear reaction-diffusion system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = Du_{xx} + cu\\\\) on a domain [0, L] with Neumann boundary conditions, where D is a diffusion coefficient and c is a reaction term. We examine the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\int_{0}^{L} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\) applied to this system.\n\nGiven the data \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) at time T, can we determine if there was an intervention changing the reaction term from c to c', solely by analyzing the Fourier transformed data?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform data at time T incorporates the cumulative effects of diffusion, reaction, and any interventions, but this integral transform generally does not provide direct evidence of intermediate changes like alterations in the reaction term. Different combinations of c, c', and initial conditions might yield similar Fourier transform results at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
