  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied to a function space such that \\\\( L \\\\) represents a Fourier Transformation, and we investigate the impact of an additional operator \\\\( M \\\\) which applies a convolution transformation with a fixed kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\).\n\nDoes applying the Fourier transformation to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) followed by evolution under the convolution operator \\\\( M \\\\) result in the same outcome as applying \\\\( M \\\\) then \\\\( L \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The sequence of transformations matters. Applying \\\\( M \\\\) after \\\\( L \\\\) changes how the convolution interacts with the frequency components altered by the Fourier transformation, leading to different outcomes compared to first applying the convolution and then transforming.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
