  "Problem": "Consider a functional equation \\\\( v(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(x,t)u(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) is a kernel function and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is an input function. The transformation applied is \\\\( w(x) = v(x) + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an intervention changes the kernel function from \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) to \\\\( K'(x,t) = K(x,t) + H(x,t) \\\\) (where \\\\( H(x,t) \\\\) is another kernel function) at some point, will the transformed output \\\\( w(x) \\\\) at x = X be solely dependent on the new kernel function \\\\( K'(x,t) \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The output after the intervention, \\\\( w(x) \\\\), which results from the modified kernel function \\\\( K'(x,t) \\\\), depends on both the original function \\\\( K(x,t) \\\\) and the intervention function \\\\( H(x,t) \\\\). The new output is influenced by the cumulative effects of both kernels on the input \\\\( u(t) \\\\), hence not solely dependent on \\\\( K'(x,t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
