  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region where the velocity field is represented by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,y) \\\\). We are interested in analyzing the result of applying a rotational transformation described by the function \\\\( R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on this velocity field over an angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nGiven the flow pattern observed at time T, can we determine exactly whether the rotational transformations \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) and/or \\\\( R(\\\\phi) \\\\) have been applied, just by analyzing the flow at that time?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of similar symmetrical properties in rotational transformations makes it challenging to pinpoint which specific rotations were applied or in what sequence. The resultant flow pattern could feasibly arise from various combinations of these transformations, obscuring the exact interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
