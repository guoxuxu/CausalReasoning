  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. This system is influenced by applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new linear transformation \\\\( S(z) = cz + d \\\\) (where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original differential equation parameters and not on \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), \\\\( c \\\\), or \\\\( d \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(z) \\\\) adds another layer of complexity, affecting the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and influencing its subsequent evolution. Since the differential equation includes a quadratic term, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on how both \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\) have altered the trajectory, especially since these transformations can significantly change the evolution path.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
