  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x) + iv(y) \\\\) representing a complex function where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(y) \\\\) are real functions defined in terms of x and y, respectively. Examine the influence of the linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants on the evolution of the function over the complex domain.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transformation \\\\( M(z) = Cz + D \\\\) (where C and D are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend solely on the behavior of the initial function \\\\( z = u(x) + iv(y) \\\\), disregarding the effects of A, B, C, and D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( M(z) \\\\) adds further complexity by shifting and scaling the trajectory in the complex domain. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is influenced by both initial and intervening transformations, making it dependent on A, B, C, and D, alongside the characteristics of \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
