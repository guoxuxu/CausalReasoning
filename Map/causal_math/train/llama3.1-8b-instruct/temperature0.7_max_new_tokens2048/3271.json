  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) = \\\\hat{u}(t, k)\\\\) and its inverse across variable transformations.\n\nIf a transformation \\\\(h(u) = u + \\\\sin(kx)u\\\\) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), will the outcome at \\\\(t = T\\\\), \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), be solely dependent on L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(h(u)\\\\), which nonlinearly alters the function, introduces additional complexity to the solution of the PDE. This extra term \\\\(\\\\sin(kx)u\\\\) impacts the function's evolution, causing the final state at time T to depend on both L and the specifics of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
