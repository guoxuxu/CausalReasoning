  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants. We consider the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this system.\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we definitively determine at what time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) the intervention changing \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\) occurred only by evaluating the transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform aggregates the effect of the differential equation over the entire time domain, making it challenging to pinpoint the exact time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) of intervention solely from the final transform. Multiple timings for similar interventions could yield comparable Laplace transforms, obscuring the specific moment of change.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
