  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We are investigating the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)](k) \\\\) on the function u(x, t).\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) can we recover the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied at the beginning or at time T?",
  "Explanation": "Because the evolution described by \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) is deterministic and reversible under the Fourier transform, and given that L is a linear operator, we can uniquely determine \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, T) \\\\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform regardless of when the Fourier transform was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
