  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) where P is a constant complex matrix. The function undergoes an integral transformation defined as \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf an additional transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{z}_{new}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}w(t)z(t)dt \\\\) (where w(t) is another complex function) is applied at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) at a later time be independent of the initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\( \\\\hat{z}_{new}(s) \\\\) intertwines with the initial state via a product with another function w(t), making the resulted endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(s) \\\\) dependent on both the initial z(t) and the intervention through w(t). The two transformations cannot be decoupled in their effects on the final endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
