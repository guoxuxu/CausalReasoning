  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where x and y are real-valued functions of time t, governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The function undergoes a transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nAssume an intervention with a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) solely depend on the original equations governed by A and B, regardless of transformations by C or D?",
  "Explanation": "With an additional intervention of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on the transformations introduced by C and D, as well as the dynamics induced by A and B. Each matrix exponentiation contributes unique scaling and rotational effects, affecting the trajectory and resulting final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
