  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions derived from the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nCan the presence and type of interventions (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) be specifically determined from the state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) by analyzing only the state value and knowing the system matrices?",
  "Explanation": "Diverse intervention sequences might lead to the same final state, particularly due to the potential complexities added by the exponential matrix interactions. The non-unique results from different paths of interventions make it difficult to pinpoint exactly which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
