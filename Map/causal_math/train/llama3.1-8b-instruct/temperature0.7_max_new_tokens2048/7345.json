  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) evolve over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\), with constants A, B, C, D. We examine the role of an integral transformation, \\\\(T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds\\\\), applied to z(t).\n\nIf \\\\(T(z)\\\\) is computed for a vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\\\), \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T align with the trajectory as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) directly evolved to t = T without \\\\(T(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z)\\\\) changes the initial conditions through accumulation over time, potentially altering the trajectory by integrating historical influence of state changes, leading to different outcomes depending on the values of A, B, C, D.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
