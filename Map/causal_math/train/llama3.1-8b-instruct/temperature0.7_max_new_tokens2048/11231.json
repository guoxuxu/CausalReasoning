  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) in relation to a linear transformation system governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. We will inspect the impact of applying transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\) over time t on the evolution of the function z(t).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( U(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) (where B is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B?",
  "Explanation": "The additional transformation \\\\( U(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) introduces another significant change to the system's state, therefore the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is influenced by both matrices A and B. The multiple matrix exponentials modify the trajectory and final position in a compounded manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
