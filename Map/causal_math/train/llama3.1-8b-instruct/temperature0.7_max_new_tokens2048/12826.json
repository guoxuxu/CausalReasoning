  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function f(z) where z is a complex number. The function is given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\) where A is a real-valued square matrix. This function represents an operator acting on z over time, and we examine the effect of applying an integral transformation with a kernel function \\\\( K(w, z) = e^{iw^T B z} \\\\), where B is also a real-valued square matrix and w is another complex variable.\n\nIf at a specific time t = t_1 a transformation using a new kernel \\\\( K(w, z) = e^{iw^T C z} \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely be influenced by A and not C or B?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new kernel adds a layer of complexity to the function’s evolution, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not just on A but also on how C interacts with the system. Even if A initially defines the transformation, the intervention with C can redefine or modify the trajectory, leading to a state at T that reflects changes from C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
