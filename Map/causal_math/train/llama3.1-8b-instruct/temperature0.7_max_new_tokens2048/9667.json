  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a set of functions defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) represents a rotation by A in the complex plane over time t. Additionally, let there be a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), where B is another constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new complex transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where C is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and not on B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) modifies the trajectory depending on the values of C and its relation to A and B. Thus, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on A, B, and C, influenced by their respective rotational contributions and timing interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
