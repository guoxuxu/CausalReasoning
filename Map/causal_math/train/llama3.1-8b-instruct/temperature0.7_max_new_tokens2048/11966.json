  "Problem": "Consider the linear transformation of a vector space described by a matrix 𝐌. An integral transformation \\\\( T[𝐱](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}𝐌𝐱(t) dt \\\\) is applied, where 𝐱(t) is a vector function affected over time and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the matrix \\\\( 𝐌 \\\\) is changed to a new matrix \\\\( 𝐍 \\\\) as an intervention, and then \\\\( 𝐱(t) \\\\) is transformed, will the resulting \\\\( T[𝐱](s) \\\\) still only depend on the original parameters of \\\\( 𝐌 \\\\) and not on \\\\( 𝐍 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by changing 𝐌 to 𝐍 modifies not only the trajectory of \\\\( 𝐱(t) \\\\) from that point onwards but also impacts the overall integral transformation. Therefore, \\\\( T[𝐱](s) \\\\) post-intervention will reflect the effects of both 𝐌 and 𝐍, showing dependency on both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
