  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) representing a solution to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at different times \\\\( t \\\\), denoted by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), can we conclude with certainty whether an intervention by operator \\\\( M \\\\) occurred at any time prior to T, solely based on the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) can indicate alterations in the system's history, multiple potential interventions or none could yield similar transformed end states due to the properties of linear operators and their superposition in linear systems. Precise identification of specific interventions like \\\\( M \\\\) requires additional context beyond just \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
