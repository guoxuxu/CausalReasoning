  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) over a rod of length L is described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\), where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\) to the initial temperature distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\).\n\nGiven the observed temperature distribution \\( T(x, t) \\) at time \\( t \\), can we determine precisely what interventions (Fourier transform or heat source application) were used, solely based on \\( T(x, t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The observed \\( T(x, t) \\) can result from multiple configurations of interventions (e.g., different timings or intensities of heat sources) and initial conditions transformed or not. The ambiguity and overlap in possible effects make identifying specific interventions challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → T(x, 0); T(x, 0) → T(x, t); heat source application → T(x, t); T(x, t) → Fourier transform; T(x, t) → heat source application; k → T(x, t); T(x, 0) → k; heat source application → k; k → thermal diffusivity constant; thermal diffusivity constant → k"
