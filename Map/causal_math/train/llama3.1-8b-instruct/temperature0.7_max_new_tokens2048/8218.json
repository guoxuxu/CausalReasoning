  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = iAz \\\\), where A is a constant real number that dictates the rate of rotation in the complex plane. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{-At}z \\\\) over time t.\n\nFrom observing \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at time t = T, can we infer the initial complex number \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowledge of whether transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Regardless of whether the transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied, the inherent properties of the rotational differential equation and the nature of the transformation (which just shifts phase temporally) ensure that the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) converges back to a path that would be consistent with one started directly from \\\\(z_0\\\\). Thus, the initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) can be deduced from \\\\(z(T)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
