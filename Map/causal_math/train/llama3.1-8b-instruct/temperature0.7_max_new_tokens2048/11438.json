  "Problem": "Let us consider a system of linear differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-iwt}dt \\\\), on this system over time.\n\nCan we determine the exact matrix \\\\( M \\\\) by analyzing the spectrum \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\) derived from the system’s behavior over time without knowing the initial state \\\\( x(0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While the spectrum \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\) gives insights into the system’s dynamics and can suggest the presence of particular eigenvalues in \\\\( M \\\\), it does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\\\( M \\\\) without additional data such as initial conditions or specific system responses, due to potential ambiguities in how different matrices can produce similar spectral characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
