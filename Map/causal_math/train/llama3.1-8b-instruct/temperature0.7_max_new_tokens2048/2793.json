  "Problem": "Consider the complex integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\\\) over a closed contour C in the complex plane, where a and w are constants, and w lies inside C. This transformation explores the impact of parameter 'a' on function behavior around singular point w.\n\nIf 'a' in the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is increased, does this directly enhance the magnitude of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) for a fixed w?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'a' would effectively increase the exponential growth of the numerator \\\\( e^{az} \\\\), which in turn enhances the overall magnitude of the integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\), especially due to the exponential factor dominating any contributions from the pole at z = w.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
