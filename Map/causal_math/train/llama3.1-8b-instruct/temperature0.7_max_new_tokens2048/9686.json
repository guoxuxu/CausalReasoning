  "Problem": "Consider a series of random variables \\\\( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \\\\), each formed by the linear transformation \\\\( Y_i = AX_i \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the Fourier transform on these variables and explore the causal inference across these transformations.\n\nAfter observing the frequency spectrum of \\\\( Y_i \\\\), can we deduce if the original variable \\\\( X_i \\\\) underwent a Fourier transform initially?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency spectrum of \\\\( Y_i \\\\) only demonstrates the outcome after both transformations (initial variable change and either pre or post Fourier transform), not the sequence of operations. Therefore, we cannot uniquely determine the order of transformations solely based on the spectrum of \\\\( Y_i \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
