  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The impact of Laplace transformation on this system is analyzed by transforming \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) separately.\n\nAfter applying an intervention where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are modulated by multiplication with a scaling function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and new Laplace transformations \\\\( X'(s) \\\\) and \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\) are applied, will the long-term behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) still be predictable from knowledge of only \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) without knowing \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( h(t) \\\\) fundamentally changes the dynamics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and thus their Laplace transforms. Predicting the detailed behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) depends critically on knowing how \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies both functions, impacting both amplitude and phase attributes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
