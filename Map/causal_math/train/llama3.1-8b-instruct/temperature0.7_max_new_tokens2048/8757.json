  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively. The system is defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), is applied to the functions \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\).\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied at t = 0 to the vector functions \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and \\\\( v_0 \\\\), and then the system \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\), \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) evolves without intervention, will the behaviors of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at time T be predictably derived from their transformed initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of the initial conditions provides a complete characterization of the system's response for linear time-invariant systems. As the differential equations governing \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are linear and constant coefficients, their behavior over time can be entirely predicted from the transformed initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
