  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) a complex vector. We explore how the system evolves under the operation of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\).\n\nIf an operation \\\\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix) is used as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Laplace transformed state be independent of matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new factor that affects the entire system's dynamical behavior and thus, the final state after the Laplace transform includes the effects of both matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\) through their respective influences on the natural state of the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
