  "Problem": "Analyze a complex function \\\\( z(t) = t^k e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where k is a non-negative integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. We also consider the impact of Laplace transformation on this function, defined as \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the values of k and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) = t^k e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is distinctive and depends explicitly on k and \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The transform \\\\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\\\) will be a function of s where k and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) parameters can be extracted based on the form of the resulting transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
