  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the input-outcome relationship described by \\\\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} Bu(s) ds + e^{At}y_0 \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and u(t) represents a control input function.\n\nCan the original state \\\\( y_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined after observing \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing the function u(t) used?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the control input u(t), we cannot uniquely reverse the state at t = T to \\\\( y_0 \\\\) because the contribution of u(t) through the integral term is unknown. The relationship between y(T) and y_0 is convolved with the effects of u(t).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
