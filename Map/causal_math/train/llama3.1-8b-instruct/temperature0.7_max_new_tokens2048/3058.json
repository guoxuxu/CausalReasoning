  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the population density \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) over space \\\\( x \\\\) and time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a diffusion coefficient. An intervention involves applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(u) \\\\) to the population distribution at a specific moment.\n\nGiven the population distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( t \\\\), can we exactly determine the initial distribution \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether any transformation like Fourier was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of an intervention such as a Fourier transform at any point, the potential modification to the population distribution introduces uncertainties, making it impossible to infer the exact initial condition directly from the later state using the PDE alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
