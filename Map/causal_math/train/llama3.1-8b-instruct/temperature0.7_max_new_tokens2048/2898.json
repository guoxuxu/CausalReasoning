  "Problem": "Consider a system where complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves according to the rule \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. To investigate the relationship, we introduce a transformation with the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nCan we retroactively ascertain the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after studying \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, without knowledge regarding the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on the application of transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is unclear whether the original state was transformed or not. Given that \\\\( D \\\\) potentially modifies the trajectory in tandem with \\\\( C \\\\), this leaves multiple plausible initial conditions for any observed state at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
