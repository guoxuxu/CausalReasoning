  "Problem": "Consider a linear system with an initial state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and a square matrix \\\\( A \\\\). The dynamics of the system are governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) \\\\). For the purpose of investigation, we introduce a transformation function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix, influencing the state vector.\n\nAssuming an intervention is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), with a new function \\\\( k(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) (where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix), will the system's state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (where \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\)) be exclusively influenced by the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) and not by \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( F \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( k(x) \\\\), an additional transforming function, modifies the system's trajectory post-\\\\( t_1 \\\\), leading to a final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) that depends on the cumulative effects of \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( F \\\\). This interplay of transformations influences the trajectory and final state in a composite manner.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
