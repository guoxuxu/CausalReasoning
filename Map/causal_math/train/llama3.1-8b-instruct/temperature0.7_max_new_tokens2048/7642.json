  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and its impact when subjected to a transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega nT} \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The observed outcome \\\\( e^{i\\omega nT} \\\\) can arise both from direct evolution under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega nt} \\\\) or via the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^n \\\\) followed by evolution under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\). Without additional information, the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
