  "Problem": "In a control system environment, the system state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the linear system dynamics \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\) where D is a linear operator. An impulse response given by the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is another linear operator, is considered over time intervals.\n\nIf the state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is observed, can one determine if the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied at t=0, without prior knowledge of \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\), and given the linear dynamics, it's impossible to definitively conclude if the transformation \\\\( Kx \\\\) was applied due to the linearity and potential overlapping trajectories in the state space governed by \\\\( D \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
