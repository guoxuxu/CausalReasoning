  "Problem": "Consider the Fourier transformation of a real-valued function \\(\\psi(t)\\) defined as \\(\\hat{\\psi}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\psi(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\). We explore the impact of a linear differential operator \\(L = d/dt + a\\), where \\(a\\) is a constant, applied to \\(\\psi(t)\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{L\\psi}(\\omega)\\), can we recover \\(\\psi(t)\\) without knowledge of the transformation by \\(L\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the exact form of the operator \\(L\\), especially the constant \\(a\\), it is not possible to uniquely invert the operation since multiple functions could correspond to the same transformed result due to the properties of the differential operator in the Fourier domain.",
