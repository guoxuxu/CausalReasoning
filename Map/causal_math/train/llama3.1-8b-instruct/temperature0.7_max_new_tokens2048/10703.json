  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex plane \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix. The Laplace transform of the function \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\) is applied to f, where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a particular point on the complex plane an integral operator with matrix C is applied as an intervention, does the final form of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) depend only on A and not on matrices B or C?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention of another transformation involving C, the resultant function’s form becomes influenced by A, B, and C. The influences of B and C, through their respective transformations integrated with the original function, contribute distinctly to the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "A → f(z); B → Laplace transform of g(t); C → integral operator; A → f(z)"
