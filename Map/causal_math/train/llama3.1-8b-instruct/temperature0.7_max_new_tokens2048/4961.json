  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) representing a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. The system's state evolution is evaluated under the Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nIf initially \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) evolves naturally without intervention through the system, will the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) at time t = T equal the transform of the circle traced out by \\\\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a function like \\\\( e^{it} \\\\), which traces the unit circle, is a Dirac delta function centered at frequency 1. Since the transformation is a linear operator and the input function is periodic with a frequency of 1, the Fourier transform at any time T where T is an integer multiple of the period will yield the same result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
