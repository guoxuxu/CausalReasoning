  "Problem": "Let's examine a scenario involving a complex function and its transformation using a Fourier Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a frequency. We analyze the effect of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on this function.\n\nCan we deduce the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) of the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after observing its Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the Fourier Transform output, the presence of a delta function at a specific frequency directly indicates the frequency of the original exponent in the complex exponential function. This allows for precise identification of \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) from the transform data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(t) → z(t) is a complex function; \\mathcal{F} → Fourier Transform is applied; Fourier Transform is applied → z(t) is transformed; z(t) is transformed → \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\omega); \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\omega) → frequency \\omega_0 is observed; frequency \\omega_0 is observed → we can deduce \\omega_0; \\mathcal{F} and z(t) → \\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\omega)"
