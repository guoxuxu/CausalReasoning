  "Problem": "Consider a heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\) which describes the heat distribution in a rod over time. We also examine a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k, t) \\\\) which transforms the heat distribution function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (external heat sources or alterations), merely by knowing the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) and the constant \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) might result from various initial conditions or interventions, exacerbated by the diffusive nature of the heat equation that blends and spreads out initial or intermediary heat sources. Identifying specific interventions just from endpoint outcomes is generally impractical without further data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
