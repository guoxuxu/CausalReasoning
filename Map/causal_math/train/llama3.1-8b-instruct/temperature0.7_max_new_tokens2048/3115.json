  "Problem": "Analyzing a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{ct}z_0\\\\) applied on initial complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) is a complex constant. The system is further governed by another complex function \\\\(w(z) = e^{dz}w_0\\\\), where \\\\(d\\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\(w_0\\\\) is the initial state of another dependent complex variable.\n\nIf a new complex function \\\\(u(z) = e^{kt}z\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant, is introduced at a certain \\\\(t = t_1\\\\), will the final outcome of \\\\(w(z(T))\\\\) for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend only on \\\\(d\\\\), disregarding \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(k\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\(u(z) = e^{kt}z\\\\) alters the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), therefore affecting the subsequent evaluation of \\\\(w(z)\\\\). The final state \\\\(w(z(T))\\\\) consequentially depends on all constants \\\\(c\\\\), \\\\(d\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\), specifically how they interact through the complex exponential functions in the range \\\\(t_1\\\\) to \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
