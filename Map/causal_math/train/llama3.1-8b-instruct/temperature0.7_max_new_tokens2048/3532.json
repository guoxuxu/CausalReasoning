  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the role of the integral transform \\\\( H(u) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sL}u(s) ds \\\\) applied to the function u over time t.\n\nCan we precisely backtrack and identify whether the initial calculation of \\\\( H(u) \\\\) was conducted, knowing that an intervention with operator \\\\( M \\\\) was applied at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), based on the state observable at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) results from complex interactions between the past effects of L, the transformative impact of \\\\( H(u) \\\\), and the further influence of M. These interactions intertwine in a manner that precludes a clear distinction of whether \\\\( H(u) \\\\) was originally computed, especially with overlapping operational effects of L and M.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
