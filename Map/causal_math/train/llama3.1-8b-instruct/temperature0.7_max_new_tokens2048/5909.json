  "Problem": "Consider the influence of a complex function z on an integral transformation defined by the integral operator T, where \\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} e^{zt} f(t) dt \\) over a contour \\( \\\\gamma \\) in the complex plane. Here, z is a complex number and \\( f(t) \\) is a function of the complex variable t.\n\nIf z is set to a specific complex value z_0 and the function f(t) = t^2, does the integral transformation \\( T[f](z_0) \\) strictly depend on the choice of z_0?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation result \\( T[f](z_0) \\) directly depends on the value of z_0 as it appears in the exponent of the integral's kernel, \\( e^{z_0t} \\). Different values of z_0 change the nature of the exponential function, affecting the outcome of the integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
