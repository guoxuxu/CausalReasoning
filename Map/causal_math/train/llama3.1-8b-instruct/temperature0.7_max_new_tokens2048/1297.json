  "Problem": "We investigate a system governed by a complex function \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( A \\\\\\) represents a matrix with complex entries and \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) is a vector in the complex plane. The transformation \\\\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\\\) with a constant matrix \\\\\\( D \\\\\\) is then applied to \\\\\\( z(t) \\\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) is applied to \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( t = 0 \\\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z \\\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\\\( z(T) \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) be the same as if \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\) just evolved to \\\\\\( T \\\\\\) under \\\\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\\\( h(z) \\\\\\) modifies the initial condition, \\\\\\( z_0 \\\\\\), to \\\\\\( h(z_0) = e^{D0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\\\) at \\\\\\( t = 0 \\\\\\). However, if \\\\\\( D \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( A \\\\\\) do not commute, the evolving trajectory of \\\\\\( z \\\\\\) will differ due to non-commutative effects in the matrix exponential multiplication, leading to different outcomes at \\\\\\( T \\\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
