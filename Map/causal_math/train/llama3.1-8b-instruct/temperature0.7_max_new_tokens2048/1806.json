  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Cz + D\\\\), where C is a matrix and D is a vector constant. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Mz + N \\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector, at an initial time t = 0.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the differential equation, without knowledge of M or N, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of both M and N, the transformation applied at the initial time, reconstructing the exact initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or confirming the use of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is impossible. Various combinations of M, N, and untransformed \\\\( z_0 \\\\) could lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making the determination ambiguous.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
