  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transformation \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) represents the Fourier space variable, on the system's behavior over time.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will the Fourier transform of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at t = T, denoted \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), be the same as directly evolving \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) to \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) under \\\\(L\\\\) and then applying the Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Fourier transform properties and linearity allow the direct Fourier transformation of the initial condition and its evolution under \\\\(L\\\\) to be equivalent to evolving the initial condition under \\\\(L\\\\) and then applying the Fourier transform. The transformation commutes with the linear operator under certain conditions (commutative with respect to time evolution).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
