  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega \\\\tau} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real-valued continuous function of time, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We seek to determine the implications of introducing a perturbation by the function \\\\( f(x) = x + c\\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the transformed integral at time T, can we determine the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing whether the perturbation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the perturbation of \\\\( x(t) \\\\), it is impossible to determine if the constant \\\\( c \\\\) was added. This ambiguity affects the inverse transform process, making it unclear whether adjustments need to be made for the constant term.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
