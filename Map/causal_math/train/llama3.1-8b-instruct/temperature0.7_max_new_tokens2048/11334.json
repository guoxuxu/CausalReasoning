  "Problem": "Investigate a control system based on the linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. Assess the impact of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the function u(x,t), denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s,x)\\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed solution \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s,x)\\\\) at a specific position x, can we determine the original PDE's initial condition without knowing whether the Laplace transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application or non-application of the Laplace transform, reconstructing the initial condition solely from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s,x)\\\\) is not necessarily possible. Information may be lost in the transformation process, such as specific details on initial time behavior or boundary conditions which are not preserved in the Laplace domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
