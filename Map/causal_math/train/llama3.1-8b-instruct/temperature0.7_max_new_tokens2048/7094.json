  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = z_0 e^{iwt} \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant, under various conditions where the function is transformed by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) over time t.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) = z_0^2 e^{iwT} \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's indeterminable if the observed end state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) arose from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or \\\\( z_0^2 \\\\). There are multiple complexities that result in the same exponentiated output due to the ambiguity whether \\\\( z(T) \\\\) corresponds to \\\\( z_0 e^{iwT} \\\\) or \\\\( (z_0^2) e^{iwT} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
