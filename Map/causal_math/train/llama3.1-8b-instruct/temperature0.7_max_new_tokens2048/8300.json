  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a contour integral transformation on a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) by proposing the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin and t is a real-parameter.\n\nKnowing the result after applying both transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and then \\\\( U(z) \\\\) to \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\), can we precisely ascertain both the original function and the specific transformations used?",
  "Explanation": "The end result is influenced by multiple parameters (t, s, C, D) and their specific configurations. Plausibly identical results may arise from different contours or parameters, obscuring a unique, reverse-engineerable pathway from the final result back to the specific interventions and original function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
