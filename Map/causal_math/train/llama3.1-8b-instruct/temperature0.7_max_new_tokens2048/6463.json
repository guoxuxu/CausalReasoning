  "Problem": "Examine the behavior of the integral transformation \\\\\\( T[f(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\\\) on the function \\\\\\( f(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\), where \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) are constants.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\\\( U[g(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-pt} g(t) dt \\\\\\) is applied at \\\\\\( t_1 \\\\\\) as an intervention, where \\\\\\( p \\\\\\) is another constant, will the final output \\\\\\( G(p) \\\\\\) depend strictly on the parameter \\\\\\( p \\\\\\) and not influenced by the original \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\\\( U \\\\\\) as an intervention, transforming the already modified function generates an effect that is dictated by both \\\\\\( p \\\\\\) and the impact of the initial \\\\\\( s \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\) from \\\\\\( T \\\\\\). Because the Laplace transform of \\\\\\( e^{-st} \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\\\) integrated again by \\\\\\( e^{-pt} \\\\\\) leads to results incorporating \\\\\\( p, s, \\\\\\) and \\\\\\( \\\\omega \\\\\\), the final outcome \\\\\\( G(p) \\\\\\) inevitably reflects all these parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
