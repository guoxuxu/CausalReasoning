  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. We explore the effects of the linear operator transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\tau e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over different time spans \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = \\\\tau \\\\), can we precisely determine the time and nature (magnitude of \\\\( k \\\\)) of intervention that occurred within the system if that is the only information provided?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) compresses the system's dynamics across the time interval into a single value, which obfuscates specific temporal dynamics such as when or how significant a parameter change was made unless additional data points or constraints are given.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
