  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = c e^{i \\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(c\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), transforming it into its frequency domain representation.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from its Fourier transform if the presence of a pre-transform phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is unknown?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the phase shift \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\), it is impossible to uniquely reconstruct \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from its Fourier transform as multiple functions differing by a phase shift can have identical magnitudes in their frequency domain representations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The phase shift causes the Fourier transform, which in turn affects the original function z(t) through its frequency domain representation, but the presence of an unknown phase shift makes it impossible to deduce the original function z(t) directly."
