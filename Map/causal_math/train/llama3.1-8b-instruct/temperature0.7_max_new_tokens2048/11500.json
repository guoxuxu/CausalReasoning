  "Problem": "Analyze a signal processing system where an input signal \\( x(t) \\) is passed through a linear time-invariant (LTI) system characterized by a convolution with an impulse response \\( h(t) \\). The transformed signal \\( y(t) \\) is then subjected to a Fourier transform, generating \\( Y(\\omega) \\).\n\nGiven \\( Y(\\omega) \\) at the output, can we determine if the intervention with \\( g(t) \\) took place, assuming we know \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the intervention \\( g(t) \\) specifically from \\( Y(\\omega) \\) is challenging without additional constraints or information. Different \\( g(t) \\) could lead to similar alterations in \\( Y(\\omega) \\), especially if \\( G(\\omega) \\) and \\( H(\\omega) \\) have overlapping spectral effects. The non-uniqueness of the convolution in the frequency domain makes it difficult to identify the exact nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
