  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\( u(x, t) \\) solving the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\), where \\( u_t \\) is the time derivative and \\( \\Delta u \\) is the Laplacian. We are interested in analyzing the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x, t) \\) and its impact over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention in the form of a different transformation \\( G(u) \\) is applied, will the end state \\( u(x, T) \\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original heat equation and not on the Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) or the intervention \\( G(u) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the transformation \\( G(u) \\) as an intervention adds another degree of manipulation to the system. The final state \\( u(x, T) \\) becomes dependent not only on the evolution of the heat equation but also on how the original \\( F(u) \\) and the intervention \\( G(u) \\) interact with the dynamics of the system, potentially altering the trajectory and the final state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
