  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(u(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-zt} f(t) dt\\\\) where z is a complex variable and f(t) represents a real-valued function of t. This integral transform is fundamental in solving differential equations and analyzing signal systems.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(u(z)\\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) without knowing whether another function \\\\(h(t)\\\\) was added to \\\\(f(t)\\\\) before applying the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of potential modifications (such as the addition of \\\\(h(t)\\\\)) to the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\), it's impossible to uniquely back out \\\\(f(t)\\\\) from \\\\(u(z)\\\\). The integral transform does not provide information about additional transformations or modifications made to \\\\(f(t)\\\\) prior to its own application.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
