  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), representing a signal in the frequency domain, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The system is then transformed by the integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), taking place over a duration T.\n\nCan we deduce the presence of the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by merely observing the output of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) without knowing its original form?",
  "Explanation": "The output by itself, especially if it is zero, does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) since it can result from any sinusoidal frequency integral over its complete cycles. Distinct frequencies can yield zero if their integral period fits into T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
