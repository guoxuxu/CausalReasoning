  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transformation \\\\( L(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Analyze the impact of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on the modified function and its interpretation.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and then the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(f)(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the resultant transformation provide the same output as directly applying the Laplace transform \\\\( L(f)(s) \\\\) to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform alters the domain and properties of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), converting it into a frequency-domain representation which changes how the resulting function behaves under the Laplace transform. The alteration from time-domain to frequency-domain affects the applicability and results of the Laplace transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
