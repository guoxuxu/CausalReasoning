  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. We evaluate its behavior under the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = e^{iwt_0} \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 = 0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under the original rule without further manipulation, will \\\\( z(t) = e^{3iwt} \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 = e^{iwt_0} \\\\) was directly evolved to \\\\( t = T \\\\) without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = z^3 \\\\) modifies the function to evolve as \\\\( z(t) = (e^{iwt})^3 = e^{3iwt} \\\\), which differs from the natural progression \\\\( e^{iwt} \\\\) at any non-zero \\\\( t \\\\). This cubic transformation accelerates the phase rotation by a factor of three.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
