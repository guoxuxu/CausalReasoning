  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\\\( u_t - \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\) in a region \\\\( \\\\Omega \\\\) and let \\\\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\\\) be the initial condition. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform over the spatial variables, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\omega, t) \\), on the solution's behavior.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) at some later time T, can one distinctly ascertain whether an intervention \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) occurred and what its form was throughout the particular interval from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "The solution at time T represents an accumulation of influences from the initial state and any external interventions, without distinct markers from the intervention. Multiple potential forms of \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) could lead to the same observed state at T due to the inherent diffusion and transformation properties of the heat equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
