  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of real variable t, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -y \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = x \\\\). We examine modifications introduced by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) before T, another transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend only on the initial equations without considering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of both \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) after \\\\( f(z) \\\\) effectively introduces opposite rotations at different times, influencing the trajectory and potentially undoing or altering the effects of the initial transformation at specific instances. Consequently, the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on the interplay between both transformations and their frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), alongside the path dictated by the original differential equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
