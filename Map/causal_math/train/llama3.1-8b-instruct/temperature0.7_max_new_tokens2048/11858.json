  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ct} z(t) dt \\\\) is explored, where C is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( G(z) = \\\\int_0^{t_1} e^{Dt}z(t)dt \\\\) (where D is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the outcome \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening function \\\\( G(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory between \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting how states contribute to the final integral in \\\\( F(z)(T) \\\\). Both C and D influence the resultant state at T through their distinct effects on the integration and the trajectory of z.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
