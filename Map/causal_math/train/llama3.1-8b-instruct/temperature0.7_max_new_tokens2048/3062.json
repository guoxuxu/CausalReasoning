  "Problem": "Consider the field of Complex Functions and Integral Transforms, specifically focusing on the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\). The initial function is \\\\( f(t) \\\\) defined for \\\\( t \\\\geq 0 \\\\). Suppose we apply the Laplace Transform to derive \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), and examine scenarios where various operations or interventions are applied, such as modifying the function or applying inverse transformations.\n\nKnowing the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we directly infer the exact form of the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform is classically invertible under reasonable conditions, allowing for the reconstruction of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) given that necessary conditions (like exponential boundedness and continuity) are met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace Transform → F(s); F(s) → f(t); Inverse Laplace Transform → f(t); f(t) → F(s); t ≥ 0 → f(t)"
