  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = w(u) \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex function of the complex variable \\\\( u \\\\). Now investigate the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](u) = \\\\int_C f(v)e^{-uv} dv \\\\), where C is a contour in the complex plane, and \\\\( f \\\\) is a complex function.\n\nKnowing the result after applying transformations \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) on \\\\( w(u) \\\\), can we discern if either or both transformations were applied, or revert to the original \\\\( w(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the combined effects of \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) through complex contour integrals and their nontrivial composition, pinpointing exactly which transformations were applied or reverse-engineering to the original function \\\\( w(u) \\\\) without more specific data about the contours or nature of exponential modifiers is highly challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
