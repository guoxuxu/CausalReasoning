  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Suppose the inverse transform \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time and it's subjected to various operations like multiplication by an exponential function or convolution.\n\nIf the function \\\\( F(s) \\\\) in the s-domain is convolved with another function \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\} \\\\), resulting in a product, does the time-domain representation of this action, \\\\( f(t) * g(t) \\\\), simply represent the convolution of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) without any alteration to the individual functions?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) in the s-domain translates directly to the convolution of their corresponding time-domain functions, \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\). This operation results in \\\\( f(t) * g(t) \\\\) where the original functions are combined through integration but retain their intrinsic properties within the new function formation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
