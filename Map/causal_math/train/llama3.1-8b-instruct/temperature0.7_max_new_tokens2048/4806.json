  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the influence of a differential operator \\\\( D \\\\), represented by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\), where A is a constant matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T(z)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(s-t)}z(s) ds \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, is applied intermittently.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely deduced after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the application of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) can significantly alter initial conditions and trajectories, not knowing whether it was applied makes it impossible to trace back to \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) uniquely, especially as the operator \\\\( B \\\\) may not align well with the effects of \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
