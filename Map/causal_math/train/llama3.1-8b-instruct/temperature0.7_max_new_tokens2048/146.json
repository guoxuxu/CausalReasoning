  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution along a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. We inspect the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) to the initial temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\).\n\nCan we determine the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) after observing \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) without knowing if the Fourier transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge if the initial condition was subject to a Fourier transform, any alterations due to the transform, especially in terms of phase and amplitude in the frequency domain, will make it impossible to accurately reconstruct \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) from \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) as the inverse process will not simply retract.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The thermal diffusivity directly influences the heat equation, which in turn affects the temperature distribution u(x, t), and observing u(x, t) at time T allows determining the initial condition u(x, 0)."
