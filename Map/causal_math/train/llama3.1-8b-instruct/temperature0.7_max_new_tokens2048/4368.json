  "Problem": "Consider a variable transformation in integral calculus defined as \\\\( u = g(x) \\\\) where g is a continuously differentiable function. We analyze the impact of changing variables from x to u in the definite integral \\\\( \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) using the transformation \\\\( du = g'(x) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nGiven the integral result with adjusted bounds \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) in the u-domain, can we determine what the original bounds a and b were, knowing the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of f(x) and the transformation g(x), the information about the specific original bounds a and b is lost when the bounds are changed post-transformation. Different sets of bounds [a, b] could potentially map to the same [c, d] depending on the specifics of g(x), making precise back-calculation infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
