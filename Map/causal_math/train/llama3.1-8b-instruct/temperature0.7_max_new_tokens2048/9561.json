  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( x \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this function over a period T.\n\nIf initially the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given without any modification, will applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at any point without further intervention change the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is a linear integral transformation involving the original function, the value at any specific time T won't be changed by applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) due to linearity and time-independence of the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
