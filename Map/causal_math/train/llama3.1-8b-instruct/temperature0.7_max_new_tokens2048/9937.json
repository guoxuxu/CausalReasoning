  "Problem": "Consider a system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves in time according to the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} = Lx \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F \\\\) to the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and then letting this transformed state evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} = Lx \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform \\\\( F(x) \\\\) is applied to an initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) and it then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} = Lx \\\\) without any further intervention, will \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at a later time t = T be the same as if \\\\( x_0 \\\\) had evolved directly under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform dramatically alters the frequency components of \\\\( x_0 \\\\), which means the system’s evolution under \\\\( L \\\\) will propagate differently compared to the untransformed state. This results in a different state at time T because the operational dynamics on the transformed frequencies can lead to disparate outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
