  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency, and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex growth rate. We are examining the effect of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-\\\\lambda s} z(s) ds \\\\) applied to this system.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the function is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda z \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be influenced solely by the angular frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) introduces a dependency on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) as well, because it alters the integral path and accumulates effects dependent on both \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This makes the behavior at time T dependent not only on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also on the integrated effect of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
