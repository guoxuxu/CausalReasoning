  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex initial condition and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the behavior under the transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant, analyzing the time evolution represented by this transformation.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) for the same time period?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially modifies the trajectory by scaling \\\\( z_0 \\\\) exponentially. Since \\\\( h(z) \\\\) effectively changes the magnitude of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) while \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) impacts the phase, the result at time T differs in magnitude compared to the trajectory without the initial transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
