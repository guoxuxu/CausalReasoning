  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We apply a time-dependent shift via an operator \\\\( H(t) \\\\) that transforms \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into \\\\( g(t) = t \\cdot f(t) \\\\) before the Laplace transform is taken, resulting in \\\\( G(s) \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( g(t) \\\\) by applying \\\\( H(t) \\\\), and then \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is calculated, will \\\\( G(s) \\\\) represent the same function as if \\\\( F(s) \\\\) was directly calculated from the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without using \\\\( H(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( H(t) = t \\cdot f(t) \\\\) inherently alters the function by embedding a multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\), leading to \\\\( G(s) = F'(s) \\\\), which is the derivative of the original transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\), thus making \\\\( G(s) \\\\) different from \\\\( F(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
