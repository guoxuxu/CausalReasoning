  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) represent the real and imaginary parts respectively, which are governed by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Au\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{v} = Bv\\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We further analyze the transformation defined by \\\\(f(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we deduce the original vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the transformation \\\\(e^{Ct}\\\\) can significantly alter the interpretation of \\\\(z_0\\\\) from the observed \\\\(z(T)\\\\), making it ambiguous whether transformations were applied or not. Both \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\), interacting with \\\\(C\\\\), can yield scenarios indiscernible from just the endpoint data, losing clarity on initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
