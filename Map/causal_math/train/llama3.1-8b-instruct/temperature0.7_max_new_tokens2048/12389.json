  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform which converts this time function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nUpon observing the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) of a function at a particular setting of \\\\( s \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the time domain without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) for all \\\\( s \\\\) and assuming it is the Laplace transform of some function, the original function can be uniquely determined through the inverse Laplace transform under standard conditions, such as region of convergence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
