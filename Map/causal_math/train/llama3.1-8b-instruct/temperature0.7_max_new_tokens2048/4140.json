  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{mt} \\\\\\) where \\\\( m \\\\) is a complex number, evolving in a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( z'(t) = kz(t) \\\\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being a real constant. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{nt}z \\\\), applied at different times, where \\\\( n \\\\) is another complex number.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine which transformations (\\\\( f(z), g(z) \\\\), or both) were applied, solely based on the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The compound effects of the transformations along with their non-commutative nature in the complex plane lead to multiple potential pathways achieving the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Identifying specific transformations uniquely from the final state is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
