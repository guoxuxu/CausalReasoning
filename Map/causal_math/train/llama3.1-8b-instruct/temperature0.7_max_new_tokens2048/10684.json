  "Problem": "Consider a linear system characterized by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ x(t) \\\\} = X(s) \\\\) and its response to the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) expressed by \\\\( U(s) \\\\). The system’s impulse response is \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ h(t) \\\\} \\\\), relating the input and output through \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the system output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) after applying a known filtering process \\\\( F(s) \\\\) to the input, can the original input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) be unequivocally reconstructed?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of the filtering process, reconstructing the original input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) from the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) involves deconvolving \\\\( y(t) \\\\) with both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( f(t) \\\\), a process which is susceptible to ambiguities and uncertainties in practical scenarios, particularly if the filters involved do not preserve all original signal information or are not invertible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
