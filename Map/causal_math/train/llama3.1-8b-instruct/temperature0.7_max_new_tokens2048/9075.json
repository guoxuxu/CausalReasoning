  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant. The transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf at time t = t_1 an intervention via a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another complex number) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not be influenced by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions using \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) at time t_1 adds a new dynamic to the system, influencing the evolution of \\\\( z \\\\) from t_1 to T in addition to the residue effects of the initial transformation \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\). The final state depends on both transformations through compounded exponential effects on \\\\( z \\\\), affecting its magnitude and phase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
