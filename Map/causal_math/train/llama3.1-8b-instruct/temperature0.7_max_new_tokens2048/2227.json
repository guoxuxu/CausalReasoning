  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the partial differential equation \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator. An integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, is applied to the system, represented by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = U(s) \\).\n\nIf an additional operator \\( M \\) is applied as an intervention at some \\( t_1 \\), modifying the system to \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Mu\\) post \\( t_1 \\), will the resulting \\( U(s) \\) for \\( s > s_1 \\) depend solely on \\( L \\) and not on \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the operator \\( M \\) alters the governing equation post \\( t_1 \\), thus changing the dynamic of \\( u(t) \\) and consequently affecting \\( U(s) \\). The resulting \\( U(s) \\) after intervention will reflect the influence of both \\( L \\) and \\( M \\), indicating a dependency on both operators.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
