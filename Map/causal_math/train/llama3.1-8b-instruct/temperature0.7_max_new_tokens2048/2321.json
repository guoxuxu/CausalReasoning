  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where a set of points \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane undergoes a transformation defined by the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\). Post-transformation, these points are subjected to an integral transformation, \\\\( T(w) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{iw} dw \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) on the interval [0, 2\\\\pi] without any further modifications, does the application of the integral transformation \\\\( T(w) \\\\) yield the same result as applying \\\\( T \\\\) directly to \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( w(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) changes the function from \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) to \\\\( w(t) = e^{ie^{it}} \\\\), which alters the domain and nature of the function vastly due to the exponential of an exponential term. Thus, the result of the integral transformation on \\\\( w(t) \\\\) will be different than applying it directly on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
