  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) representing a Laplace transform of a function z(t) in the complex domain. We explore how modifying z(t) by applying a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), impacts the result of the integral where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), adjusting the function to \\\\( h(z) = e^{-\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\) where \\\\( t \\\\geq t_1 \\\\), will the transformed \\\\( f(z)(s) \\\\) at s depend uniquely on the properties of the new function h?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting function after intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system only from time \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Therefore, the final Laplace transform \\\\( f(z)(s) \\\\) is a composite result influenced by both the initial application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and the subsequent intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\). It reflects accumulated effects from before and after \\\\( t_1 \\\\), making it contingent on both transformations, not just the latter.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
