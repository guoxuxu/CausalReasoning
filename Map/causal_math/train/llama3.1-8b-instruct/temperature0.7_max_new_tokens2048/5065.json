  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t), y(t) \\\\) are components following the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effect of the transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix and \\\\( t \\\\) denotes time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alters the original state by scaling and rotating components, dependent on C. This intervention modifies the evolution path, causing differences in \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), hence altering \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T despite similar governing equations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
