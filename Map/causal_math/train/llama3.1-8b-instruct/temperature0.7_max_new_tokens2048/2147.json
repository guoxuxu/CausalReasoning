  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L[u] \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We analyze changes in solution behavior under the influence of the transformation \\\\( v(x,t) = e^{\\\\omega t}u(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf we intervene at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying another transformation \\\\( w(x,t) = e^{\\\\gamma t}v(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) is another complex constant, will the state at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the operator \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of \\\\( e^{\\\\gamma t} \\\\) introduces another exponential scaling factor modifying the evolution dynamics further. The system's state at time T is influenced by both \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) alongside the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), as these transformations affect how the initial state evolves over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
