  "Problem": "Consider two complex functions \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and \\\\(w(t)\\\\) where \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and \\\\(w(t) = \\\\log(t)\\\\). The scenario examines the relationship between these functions under different operations and transformations such as differentiation and integration in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the integral values from 0 to T of both \\\\(z(t)\\\\) and \\\\(w(t)\\\\), can we trace back and determine if the operations applied on one (like any transformation or differentiation) could have been influenced or necessitated by the operations on the other?",
  "Explanation": "The integral operations on both functions result in outputs dependent strictly on their respective function definitions and the limits of integration. The nature of these integrals in the complex and real domains respectively do not provide insights or influence over the operational paths taken for the other function. Therefore, the specific operations on one cannot be deduced or necessitated by operations on the other.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
