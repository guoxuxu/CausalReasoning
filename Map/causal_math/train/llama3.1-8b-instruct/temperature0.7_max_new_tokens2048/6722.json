  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{Bt} f(t) dt \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nHaving observed the transformed state \\\\( T[w](Z) \\\\), is it possible to perfectly reconstruct the original function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at any point without knowledge of \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation process involves an integration that blends the effects of A and B in potentially complex ways, obscuring direct knowledge of the original function's state at any point unless further details about B or the integral path are known.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
