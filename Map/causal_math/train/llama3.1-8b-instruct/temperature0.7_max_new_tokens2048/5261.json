  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z = u(x) + iv(y) \\\\) representing a complex function where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(y) \\\\) are real functions defined in terms of x and y, respectively. Examine the influence of the linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants on the evolution of the function over the complex domain.\n\nIf \\\\( L(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve without further intervention under the function \\\\( z = u(x) + iv(y) \\\\), will the resulting value of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) were evolved to t = T under the same function without applying \\\\( L(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( L(z) \\\\) modifies the initial complex number, which changes the trajectory in the complex plane over time. As \\\\( L(z) \\\\) shifts and scales \\\\( z_0 \\\\), the outputs of \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\) are affected, leading to a different endpoint value at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
