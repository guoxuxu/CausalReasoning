  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = \\\\\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), can we uniquely identify the coefficient \\\\( a \\\\) in \\\\( e^{ax^2} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace transform captures transformations of \\\\( z(x) \\\\), determining the exact value of \\\\( a \\\\) solely from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) generally requires more information due to possible similar transformation effects from different \\\\( a \\\\) values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
