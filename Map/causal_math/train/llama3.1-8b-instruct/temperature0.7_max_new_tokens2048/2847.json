  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function represents a simple harmonic oscillator in the complex plane. We examine the response of the system under a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), assuming no initial conditions.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) the function is altered by applying an exponential damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant, will the Laplace-transformed function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha - i\\\\omega} \\\\) depict the behavior of the original function without intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the damping factor \\\\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\\\) alters the oscillatory nature of the original system. It shifts the pole in the Laplace domain from \\\\( s = i\\\\omega \\\\) to \\\\( s = \\\\alpha + i\\\\omega \\\\), thus changing the frequency and decay characteristics of the system. This modification fundamentally alters the system's response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
