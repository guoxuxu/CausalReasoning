  "Problem": "Consider a complex variable function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), where A and B are constant coefficients. We explore the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on this system over time t, where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (with D as another complex constant) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), would the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by A and B, regardless of C and D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces another complex exponential factor, diversifying the final state's dependence to include C and D as well. The combined influence of the exponential transformations brought by C and D, with their own growth and rotation characteristics, strongly affects the trajectory and final outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
