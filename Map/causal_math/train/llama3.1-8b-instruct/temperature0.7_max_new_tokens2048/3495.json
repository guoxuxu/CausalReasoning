  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and let the transformation be defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\theta t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being another real constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(z) = z(t) + e^{i \\beta t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\beta \\\\) is a real constant, and then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is evaluated from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T, is the result of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) dependent only on \\\\( \\theta \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention introduces a new frequency component to the system, which means the resulting integral after the intervention depends on both the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\), the intervention's frequency \\\\( \\beta \\\\), and the parameter \\\\( \\theta \\\\). This makes the integral's result influenced by each of these factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
