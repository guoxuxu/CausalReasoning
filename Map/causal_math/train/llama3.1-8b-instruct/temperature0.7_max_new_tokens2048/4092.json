  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\(C\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are constants. We explore the effect of applying a linear transformation \\\\(T(z) = Az + B\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\(T(z)\\\\), \\\\(U(z)\\\\), or both) solely by knowing the outcome \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the possible combinations and effects of \\\\(A\\\\), \\\\(B\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(E\\\\) in transforming the initial conditions and evolving the system state, multiple transformation sequences could result in the same endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\). These transformations and their non-trivial interplays yield ambiguities in backward determining them based on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
