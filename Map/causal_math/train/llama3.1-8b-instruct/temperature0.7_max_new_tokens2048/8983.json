  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} =  L u \\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We inspect the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} u(x, t) \\\\, dt \\\\), which is the Laplace transform of \\\\( u \\\\) with respect to time.\n\nIf, at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention defined by another function \\\\( G(u) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-kt}u(x, t) dt \\\\) (where k is a constant different from s) is applied, will the behavior of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( G(u) \\\\), another transform, alters how we are observing or interacting with \\\\( u \\\\) but it does not change the governing dynamics directly; however, interpretations and subsequent observational or numerical changes do depend on the choices of s and k in addition to L.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
