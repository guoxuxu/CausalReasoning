  "Problem": "A physical system's temperature distribution, u(x,t), satisfies the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\), with k being the thermal diffusivity. A transformation \\\\( g(u) = u + Ce^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where C and \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) are constants, is studied to evaluate its effect on the system.\n\nIs it possible to precisely determine the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) after observing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of application of \\\\( g(u) \\\\), the original distribution \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) cannot be accurately determined due to the potential additive term \\\\( Ce^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), which can significantly alter the observed state at time T.",
