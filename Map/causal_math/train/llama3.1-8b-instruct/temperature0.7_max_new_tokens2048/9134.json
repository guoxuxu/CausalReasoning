  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are time-dependent functions defined in a physical system. The causal inference is analyzed through the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\), where complex frequency s incorporates both decay and oscillatory behaviors.\n\nCan the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be reconstructed precisely by observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > 0 and applying the inverse Laplace transform, if the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was subjected to an unknown initial transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The possibility to revert \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) via the inverse Laplace transform depends crucially on knowing whether and how \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was initially transformed. Unknown alterations to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) lead to irrecoverable changes in the frequency domain, making exact back-calculation to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) impossible without full knowledge of initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
