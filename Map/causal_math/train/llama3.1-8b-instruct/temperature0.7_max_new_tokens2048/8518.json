  "Problem": "Consider a damped harmonic oscillator modeled by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\dot{x} + \\\\omega^2x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are damping and angular frequency parameters, respectively. Let's analyze the effect of a transformation on the initial conditions by applying a function \\\\( g(x) = x_0e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the observation of the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we conclusively determine the original initial position \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if we do not know whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied, we cannot uniquely trace back to \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The transformation could have altered the amplitude or phase, making it unclear whether the changes in the system's characteristics at time T are due to natural dynamics or the initial modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "initial position x_0 → position x(t); damping parameter ζ → damping term; angular frequency ω → angular frequency term; transformation λ → position x(t); position x(t) → observation; transformation λ → x_0; x_0 → position x(t); λ → position x(t)"
