  "Problem": "Assume a problem in complex functions where the operation involves applying the Fourier transform on a function \\(\\phi(t)\\), which is described as \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\phi)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\phi(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\). The transformed function is then acted on by a linear transformation \\(\\mathbf{L}\\), which alters frequencies in a specific predictable way.\n\nGiven the information of the Fourier-transformed output \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\phi(T))(\\omega)\\), is it possible to reconstruct the entire sequence of transformations and original function, assuming sporadic interventions have occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of interventions, especially when linear transformations like \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) are involved, can significantly alter the state of \\(\\phi(t)\\) without leaving traceable characteristics post-Fourier transform. Without additional details regarding when and how these interventions were applied, it is generally not feasible to uniquely determine the sequence of events leading to the observed transformed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
