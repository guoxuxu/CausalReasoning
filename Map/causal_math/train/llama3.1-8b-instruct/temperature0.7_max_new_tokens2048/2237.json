  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evolving from t = 0 to t = T under the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\), will the final form of \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) match that evolved only under its original evolution without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the integral transformation modifies the integral path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), with the exponential \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) influencing the rate and manner of accumulation over time. This results in a transformed state at time T that differs from simple exponential evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
