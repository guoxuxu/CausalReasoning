  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\) in a two-dimensional domain. We explore the impact of a boundary condition modification \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\), a given function, and how it affects the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) across the domain.\n\nGiven the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) for all (x, y) in the domain, can we uniquely determine the boundary condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\) without prior knowledge of this boundary being applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Laplace equation is linear, the dependence of the solution on boundary conditions is direct and reversible. Knowing the solution \\\\( \\\\phi(x,y) \\\\) throughout the domain allows the extrapolation back to the boundary condition \\\\( \\\\phi(x,0) = h(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
