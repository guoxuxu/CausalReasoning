  "Problem": "Consider a system subjected to the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse being applied under different scenarios. The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) describes an oscillatory behavior \\\\( f(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the transformed and altered function in the Laplace domain, can we determine if the original function was indeed \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) and not another function with similar properties after the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "After intervention such as multiplication by \\\\( e^{-s} \\\\), it's challenging to discern if the original function was exactly \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) or another function of similar exponential nature due to the equivalent effects of shifting in the time domain. This introduces ambiguity in unambiguously identifying the original function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
