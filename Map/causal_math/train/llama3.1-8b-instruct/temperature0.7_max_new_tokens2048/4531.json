  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), which evolves over time according to the Schrödinger-like equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = iAz\\\\), where A is a constant matrix and i represents the imaginary unit. An intervention is defined by the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Bt}z\\\\), where B is another constant matrix different from A.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) (where C is a constant matrix) is applied, will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 solely depend on the initial conditions setup by A without considering contributions from B or C?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\\\(g(z) = e^{Ct}z\\\\) at \\\\(t_1\\\\) integrates another dynamic aspect into the system, making the final state dependent on A, B, and C. The interplay between these transformations, especially with different matrices, substantially influences the trajectory and final position of z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
