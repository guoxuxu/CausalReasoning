  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_{tt} - c^2 u_{xx} = 0 \\), commonly known as the wave equation, where \\( c \\) is the wave speed. The study focuses on the effect of applying an integral transformation \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-s^2x^2} u(x,t) \\, dx \\), where \\( s \\) is a constant.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\( S(u) = u(x - v, t - k) \\) (where \\( v \\) and \\( k \\) are constants) is introduced as an intervention at \\( t = t_1 \\), will \\( T(u(x,T)) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on the wave equation and not on the initial application of \\( T \\) or the intervention \\( S \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\( T(u(x,T)) \\) will be influenced both by the initial transformation \\( T \\) and the later intervention \\( S \\). \\( S \\) shifts both the spatial and temporal arguments of \\( u \\), altering how \\( u \\) is evolved and later integrated by \\( T \\). The Gaussian kernel integration and the shift could interact in complex ways, making \\( T(u(x,T)) \\) dependent on both the nature of \\( T \\) and \\( S \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
