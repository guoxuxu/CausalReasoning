  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = x + iy\\\\), representing a complex variable where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are real numbers. We now explore the implications of the Laplace transform applied to this function, transforming it to \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), where \\\\(s\\\\) is a complex parameter.\n\nGiven \\\\(F(s)\\\\) from the naturally evolved \\\\(z(t)\\\\), can the original form of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) be uniquely restored without additional data on typical properties or constraints of \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming all conditions for the Laplace transform's uniqueness and invertibility are met (typically, \\\\(z(t)\\\\) being well-defined and sufficiently smooth), the inverse Laplace transformation can uniquely recover \\\\(z(t)\\\\) from \\\\(F(s)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
