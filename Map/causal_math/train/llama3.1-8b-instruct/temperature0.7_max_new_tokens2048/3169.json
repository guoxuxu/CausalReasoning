  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving along the x-axis influenced by a velocity field described by the complex function \\\\( v(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\), where \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) is a complex variable. An integral transform \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the velocity function along specific paths.\n\nIf the integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to the velocity function \\\\( v(z) \\\\) at a particular position z_0 without further manipulation, will the transformed velocity function at another position z_1 be equivalent to direct evaluation at z_1?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) alters the functional form of \\\\( v \\\\) by integrating it over an exponential, which affects how the velocity field behaves at different points. Application at z_0 does not imply the same effect at z_1 due to the unique contributions from the positions in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
