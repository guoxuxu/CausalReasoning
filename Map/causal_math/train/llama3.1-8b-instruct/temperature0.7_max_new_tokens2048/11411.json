  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the function \\\\( z(t) = wt \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number with real and imaginary parts. We introduce a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) that takes the form \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( T \\\\) is a finite time.\n\nIf a manipulation is introduced at some point such as transforming \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w' \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\) depend only on the new value \\\\( w' \\\\) and not on the original \\\\( w \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The result \\\\( L(z)(T) \\\\) would be influenced by the values of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) both before and after the manipulation. Thus it depends on \\\\( w \\\\) from \\\\( 0 \\\\) to \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and on \\\\( w' \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), reflecting both contributions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
