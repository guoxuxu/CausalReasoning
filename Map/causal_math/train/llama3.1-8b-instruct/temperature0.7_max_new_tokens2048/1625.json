  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) of the function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), such that \\\\( F(s) = L\\\\{f(t)\\\\} \\\\) represents the transformation of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into the complex frequency domain. Let us analyze how the convolution operation with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) affects the transformed system.\n\nIf a convolution \\\\( (f * g)(t) \\\\) is applied and then transformed using Laplace transform without any further intervention, does the result \\\\( L\\\\{(f * g)(t)\\\\} \\\\) equal the product of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\), where \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "According to the properties of the Laplace transform, the transform of the convolution of two functions equates to the product of their individual transforms in the frequency domain. Hence, \\\\( L\\\\{(f * g)(t)\\\\} = F(s)G(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
