  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing the angular frequency. This function describes a rotation in the complex plane. The impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) over time is analyzed.\n\nGiven the final state of the transformed function \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( T[z] \\\\), \\\\( U[z] \\\\), or both) merely by knowing the outcome at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the overlapping effects and potential equivalences in the outcomes of different transformation sequences, it's not possible to definitively identify which transformations were applied to reach the observed endpoint \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\). The non-trivial interaction between integral transformations compounding the original function adds ambiguity in identifying specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
