  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\lambda u + \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{t} e^{-\\\\alpha(t-s)}u(s)ds\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\lambda\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) are constants. The behavior of the system is analyzed when subject to transformations using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\).\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at T, can we deduce the exact form of \\\\( u(0) \\\\) without knowing if a Laplace transform was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by Laplace may alter the initial conditions in a non-reversible way, especially given the integral component and the decay factor in the differential equation. Without knowing the initial transformation, the original form of \\\\( u(0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
