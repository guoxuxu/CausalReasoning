  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit in which the voltage across a capacitor undergoes a Fourier transformation, defined by \\\\(F(v(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty v(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt\\\\), where \\\\(v(t)\\\\) is a voltage function of time, and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. We're analyzing the impact of the operation defined by the transfer function \\\\(H(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{1 + i\\\\omega\\\\tau}\\\\), with a constant \\\\(\\\\tau\\\\).\n\nCan we determine with certainty whether the input signal was only processed by \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\), only by \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\), or by both, given the final time-domain output and knowing the function of \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\) but not \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final output can result from different combinations of applications of \\\\(G(\\\\omega)\\\\) and \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\), and without explicit knowledge of \\\\(H(\\\\omega)\\\\)'s characteristics or the original signal, distinguishing between these scenarios is not feasible. The overlapping effects and potential similarity in outcomes under different conditions make definitive causal inference challenging.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Input signal → Fourier transformation; Fourier transformation → ω; ω → H(ω); H(ω) → τ; τ → Transfer function H(ω); Transfer function H(ω) → Output; Output → Time-domain output; Time-domain output → Input signal processed by H(ω); Time-domain output → Input signal processed by G(ω); Input signal processed by H(ω) → Input signal processed by both; Input signal processed by G(ω) → Input signal processed by both; Input signal processed by both → Input signal processed by H(ω) or G(ω)"
