  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(x)) = \\\\int_0^x e^{-(x-t)} u(t) dt \\\\), on functions and its implications in a functional space. We explore whether this transformation can alter or trace back the cause of changes in function behaviors.\n\nIf the function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) and then left to evolve under the normal function rules without further interventions, will the final form of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) bear a direct and unchanged relation from its original form?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) essentially alters the function by applying a convolution with the kernel \\\\( e^{-(x-t)} \\\\), which modifies the input function's characteristics. This transformation affects the subsequent behavior of the function, and therefore, the final form of \\\\( u(x) \\\\) does not maintain a simple traceable relation to its original state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Transformation by \\mathcal{L} → Change in u(x); u(x) → Evolution under normal function rules; Transformation by \\mathcal{L} → Final form of u(x); Evolution under normal function rules → Final form of u(x)"
