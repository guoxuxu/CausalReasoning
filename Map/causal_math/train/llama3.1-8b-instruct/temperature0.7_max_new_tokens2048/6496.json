  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential field described by the potential function \\\\( V(x) = -\\\\alpha x^2 + \\\\beta x^4 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants. Investigate the effects of perturbing the initial position of the particle using a transformation \\\\( g(x) = x + \\\\delta \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) is a small constant, on the system's long-term behavior.\n\nKnowing the particle's final position at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we distinguish whether the initial perturbation \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\), the mid-way shift \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\), or both were applied, solely based on the final position?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential overlaps in trajectories caused by different combinations of initial and intervening perturbations in a nonlinear system, it's not feasible to precisely attribute the final position to specific perturbations. Multiple permutations of \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\epsilon \\\\) could lead to similar or indistinguishable final states at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
