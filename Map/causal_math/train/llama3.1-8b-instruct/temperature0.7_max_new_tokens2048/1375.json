  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), denoted as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We investigate how the application of a convolution transformation defined by kernel \\\\( h(t) \\\\), with its Laplace transform \\\\( H(s) \\\\), affects the system.\n\nIf an intervention by altering the kernel to a new kernel \\\\( j(t) \\\\) with Laplace transform \\\\( J(s) \\\\) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the Laplace transform of the resultant function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{(g \\\\ast j)(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) at any \\\\( s \\\\) depend only on \\\\( J(s) \\\\) and not on the previous kernel \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the convolution kernel from \\\\( h(t) \\\\) to \\\\( j(t) \\\\). Since the system evolves under \\\\( g(t) \\\\) convoluted with the new kernel post-intervention, the resultant Laplace transform reflects \\\\( G(s)J(s) \\\\), independent of the previous \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The causal effect is reset with the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
