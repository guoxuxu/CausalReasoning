  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of the system governed by the differential equation \\\\(dx/dt = Ax\\\\), where A is a 2x2 constant matrix. Observe the influence of the transformation defined by \\\\(g(x) = Px\\\\), where P is a constant invertible 2x2 matrix, and its effects on the solutions.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\), is it possible to determine exactly which transformations (whether \\\\(g(x)\\\\) or \\\\(h(x)\\\\), or both) were applied solely based on the knowledge of \\\\(x(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\(x(T)\\\\) could result from different scenarios and transformations due to the non-commutativity of the matrices involved and potential dependencies on the specific functional forms and parameters of P and Q. This ambiguity obstructs the precise identification of which transformations were executed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
