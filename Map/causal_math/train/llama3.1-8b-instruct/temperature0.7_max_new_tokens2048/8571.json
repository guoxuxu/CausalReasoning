  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We examine the effects of applying the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), to this function and then subsequently its inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nIf after applying the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) but before the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\), a linear operator \\\\( P(s) \\\\) (where \\\\( s \\\\) is the complex frequency variable) is applied, will this intervention solely affect the function based on the operator \\\\( P(s) \\\\) without affecting the initial causative form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the linear operator \\\\( P(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain modifies the transformed function in a way that directly impacts the resultant time-domain function after applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\). The modification could alter amplitude, phase, or introduce new components, thereby not preserving the initial form of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
