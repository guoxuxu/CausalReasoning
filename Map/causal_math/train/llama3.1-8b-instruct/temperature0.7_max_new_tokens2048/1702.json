  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a complex constant matrix. We study the implications of a Laplace transformation given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) on this function over the complex variable z.\n\nCan we exactly recover the matrix A from the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) without additional information about the complex variable s?",
  "Explanation": "The original matrix A impacts the function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) in a way that its effects are modified by the transformation process involving s. Without knowing s, it is typically impossible to uniquely determine A since multiple values of A could result in similar transformations depending on s.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
