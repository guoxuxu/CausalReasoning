  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z = x + yi \\\\) is mapped using \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. We investigate the function under two scenarios: one driven by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Bz \\\\) with B being another complex constant, and another by a transformation function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a third complex constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, can we infer the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, if we only know that the system evolved under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Bz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not guarantee the retrieval of the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) was applied because the complex exponential transformation might have altered the initial state in a manner that is not reversible or discernible, especially if A and B do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
