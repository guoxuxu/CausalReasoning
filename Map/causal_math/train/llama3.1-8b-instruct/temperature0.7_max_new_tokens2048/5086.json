  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Lx + Mu\\\\), where L and M are constant matrices and u represents control input. Let's explore the effect of an integral transformation \\\\(T(x) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}x dt\\\\), where Q is a constant matrix, on the system.\n\nIf we observe the system's state \\\\(x(t)\\\\) at time t, can we determine the original state \\\\(x_0\\\\) accurately without knowing if the transformation \\\\(T(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\(T(x)\\\\) potentially modifies the initial state in a complex way through the integral of an exponential function, which is not easily reversible without explicit knowledge about the presence and specific nature of the transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
