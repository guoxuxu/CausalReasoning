  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) and its transformation by a Fourier Transform, denoted as \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\). Here, \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), respectively, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the frequency variable.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the transformed function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) over all frequencies without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform is invertible under appropriate conditions (such as \\\\( z(t) \\\\) being sufficiently well-behaved). Thus, knowing \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) over all frequencies allows the precise reconstruction of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), implying a direct and unique traceability from effect back to cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
