  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a constant matrix. The function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied at time t, transforming the system's state.\n\nCan we deduce the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T = t, without knowing whether the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, it is not possible to accurately backtrack from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). The squaring operation modifies initial states in a way that makes it infeasible to determine whether the original state was \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or the square root of \\\\( z_0 \\\\), especially given the complex plane's properties.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
