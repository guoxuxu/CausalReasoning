  "Problem": "Consider assessing the stability of a system described by a Laplace transform \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\frac{U(s)}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\), where a and b are constants and \\\\( U(s) \\\\) is a known function in the s-domain. We evaluate the effect of the inverse Laplace transform given by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{Y(s)\\\\} \\\\) over time t.\n\nDoes altering the constants a and b (parameters of the original differential equation), without any intervention, change the long-term behavior of \\\\( y(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the constants a and b alters the characteristic equation of the differential equation which directly affects the stability and oscillatory nature of the system. These changes modify the poles of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), thereby influencing the system's response over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
