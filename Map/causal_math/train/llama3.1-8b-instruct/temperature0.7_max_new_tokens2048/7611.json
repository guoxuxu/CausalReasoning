  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\(z(t)\\) described by the differential equation \\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\(\\omega\\) is a real constant frequency. Now analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\) over time \\(t\\).\n\nIf, at a specific time \\( t_1 \\) within the interval [0, T], an intervention is applied in the form of another transformation \\( Q(z) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\), will the endpoint \\( T(z(T)) \\) only depend on the initial differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( Q(z) \\) during the dynamics introduces additional complexity by altering the overall state of \\( z(t) \\) up to \\( t_1 \\), modifying it with \\( e^{i\\omega s} \\). This affects the subsequent evolution under \\( T(z) \\) in a way that results in an endpoint \\( T(z(T)) \\) dependent on both the original dynamics and the intervention \\( Q(z) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
