  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing system where a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\) modulates an input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) according to the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (h * x)(t) \\\\). \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is then analyzed at various time points t using a Fourier transform.\n\nIf the convolution \\\\( h * x \\\\) is applied to an input signal and then transformed using a Fourier transform without any additional filtering, will the resultant spectrum \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) differ from the Fourier transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) by attenuating its components, especially fading out higher frequencies due to the exponential decay term \\\\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\). This results in a different frequency spectrum \\\\( Y(\\omega) \\\\) than what would be obtained from the Fourier transform of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
