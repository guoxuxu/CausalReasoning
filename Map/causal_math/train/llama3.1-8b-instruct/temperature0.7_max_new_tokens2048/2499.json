  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system governed by a vector field \\\\(V(z) = i\\\\beta z\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a real constant. The transformation considered is \\\\(f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a complex constant, and t represents time.\n\nSuppose at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an intervention is applied to the system with \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\gamma t}z\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) is another complex constant). Will the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention at \\\\(t_1\\\\) introduces a new scaling and rotational dynamic because of \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), which affects the evolution post-intervention. Hence, the final state depends on the interaction between \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\), and the field coefficient \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\), altering the system's trajectory through complex scaling.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
