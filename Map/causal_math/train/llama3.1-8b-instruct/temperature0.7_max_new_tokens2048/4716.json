  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant matrix and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function defines wave-like motion in the complex plane over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\) where \\\\( B \\\\) is another real constant matrix, is applied to study its effect.\n\nAfter observing the function at \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately deduce whether the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) involving \\\\( B \\\\) was applied or not, assuming we know the function was originally defined by \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the specific involvement of \\\\( T \\\\) and consequently \\\\( B \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined. The resulting function at \\\\( T \\\\) might correspond to multiple potential scenarios including different parameters for \\\\( B \\\\) or none at all, given the complex interactions and superpositions in the complex plane.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
