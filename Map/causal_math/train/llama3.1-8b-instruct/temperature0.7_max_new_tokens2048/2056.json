  "Problem": "Examine the application of Laplace transforms in a control system where an input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is transformed using \\\\( L(u(t)) = U(s) \\\\). The system's response \\\\( X(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) represents the complex frequency domain, is dictated by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The analysis focuses on the behavior of the system under different transformations and interventions.\n\nGiven the combined system's output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) after the intervention with \\\\( G(s) \\\\), is it possible to determine unequivocally whether the observed effect is because of the original system described by \\\\( H(s) \\\\), the intervention \\\\( G(s) \\\\), or both?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying conclusively which elements (\\\\( H(s) \\\\) or \\\\( G(s) \\\\)) influenced the final combined output \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) can be challenging without additional context, as the transfer functions’ contributions are intertwined in the product \\\\( G(s) H(s) U(s) \\\\). Such a scenario does not provide enough information to distinguish between the effects of the original system and the intervention independently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
