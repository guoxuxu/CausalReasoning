  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( S \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the exact form of the initial function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t=T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the integral transform \\\\( T[z] \\\\), it could substantially modify the initial conditions in a non-trivial manner. Without certainty on the application of \\\\( T[z] \\\\), predictions or reversals aiming to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be accurate, especially due to the complex interaction between \\\\( P \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
