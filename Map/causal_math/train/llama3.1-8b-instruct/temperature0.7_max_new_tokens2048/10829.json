  "Problem": "Consider the system governed by the integral equation \\( y(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} K(s) \\, ds \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( K(t) \\) is a time-dependent control function applied to the system. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\( f(y) = Cy + D \\) where \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) are constant matrices, at time \\( t_0 \\).\n\nIf the transformation \\( f(y) \\) is applied to \\( y(t_0) \\) and the system then evolves according to its integral equation without further intervention, will \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_0 \\) be the same as if \\( y(t_0) \\) was evolved according to only the original integral equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\( f(y) \\) modifies \\( y(t) \\) at \\( t_0 \\) by adding \\( D \\) and altering the scaling through \\( C \\). This adjusted initial condition changes how the integral accumulates values from \\( t_0 \\) to \\( T \\), resulting in a different \\( y(T) \\) than if no transformation were applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
