  "Problem": "Analyze the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\\\) applied to a complex plane, and its interaction under the mapping \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) for complex variable z. Consider the causal impact of these transformations on resulting values over the domain of complex numbers.\n\nGiven the final transformation result, can we conclusively determine the sequence of functions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) then \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) then \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or their combinations) used, by just knowing the output?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the exponential function's periodic nature and the squaring transformation's effect on amplitude and phase, the same output could potentially be obtained from multiple different sequences of applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\). This ambiguity prevents a definitive back-calculation of the operations or their order.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
