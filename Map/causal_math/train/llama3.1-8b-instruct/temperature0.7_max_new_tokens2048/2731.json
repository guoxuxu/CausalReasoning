  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\) governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Dz\\\\), where D is a constant complex number. We examine the outcome of the transformation specified by the function \\\\(h(z) = e^{Et}z\\\\), with E being another constant complex number, over time t.\n\nIf, at some specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\), a new function \\\\(k(z) = e^{Ft}z\\\\) (where F is a constant complex number) is applied as an intervention, will the final outcome \\\\(z(T)\\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on D and not on E or F?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(k(z)\\\\) adds yet another layer of complexity, making the terminal state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) contingent on E, F, and D. The effects imposed by \\\\(e^{Et}\\\\) and \\\\(e^{Ft}\\\\) can significantly modify the system's path and the eventual position of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) through their respective influences.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
