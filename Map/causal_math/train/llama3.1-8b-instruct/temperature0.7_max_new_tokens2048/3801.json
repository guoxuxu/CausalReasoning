  "Problem": "Consider a fluid dynamics problem described by the Navier-Stokes equation in a two-dimensional domain. The velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,t) \\\\) of the fluid is influenced by a forcing function \\\\( \\\\vec{F}(x,t) \\\\). We are exploring the effect of a transformation applied to the velocity field: \\\\( \\\\vec{u}'(x,t) = \\\\vec{u}(x,t) + \\\\nabla \\\\phi(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) is a scalar potential function.\n\nIf the initial velocity field \\\\( \\\\vec{u}_0(x) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( \\\\vec{u}'_0(x) = \\\\vec{u}_0(x) + \\\\nabla \\\\phi_0(x) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the normal Navier-Stokes dynamics without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\vec{u}(x,T) \\\\) at time T be identical to the field evolved from \\\\( \\\\vec{u}_0(x) \\\\) to T?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of the gradient of the scalar potential \\\\( \\\\nabla \\\\phi \\\\) modulates the initial condition, altering the trajectory of the velocity field. Variations in the potential \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\), which might adhere to different dynamics, can lead to distinct outcomes in the evolved field at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
