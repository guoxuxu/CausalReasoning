  "Problem": "Consider a system in which the temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. We investigate what happens when a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied on the initial temperature distribution, and later an inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) is used.\n\nIf the initial temperature distribution \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is mapped by a Fourier transform and then allowed to evolve according to the heat equation, will the temperature distribution at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be exactly representable by applying the inverse Fourier transform to the evolved transform?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial condition, followed by an analytical solution of the transformed heat equation and an inverse Fourier transform, will correctly reproduce the time-evolved temperature distribution. The linear nature of both the Fourier transform and the heat equation preserves the transformation sequence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
