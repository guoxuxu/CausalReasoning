  "Problem": "Investigate a discrete dynamical system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant square matrix representing the evolution operator, and \\\\( x_n \\\\) is the state vector at the n-th step. We also explore the influence on the system of applying a nonlinear transformation \\\\( h(x) = x + u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is a constant vector.\n\nGiven the state vector \\\\( x_n \\\\) at step n, is it possible to infer whether the initial transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied to \\\\( x_0 \\\\), assuming no other interventions took place and without knowing \\\\( u \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the vector \\\\( u \\\\), and given that linear transformations and vector additions can yield equivalent outcomes from different initial states, one cannot definitively trace whether \\\\( x_0 \\\\) was altered by \\\\( h(x) \\\\) initially. There can be multiple starting points and transformations producing the same outcome at step n.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
