  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of the complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z(t) + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing the angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. Consider the effect of applying the integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-i\\\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\) on this system.\n\nIf \\\\( T[z] \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at the initial condition \\\\( z(0) = z_0 \\\\), and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z(t) + k \\\\) without further intervention, will the transformed state at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the original differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) integrates the function tuned by the exponential term \\\\( e^{-i\\\\omega s} \\\\), which alters the progression of the state from the original path dictated by the differential equation. This complex exponential influences the phase and growth of the function, leading to a different trajectory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
