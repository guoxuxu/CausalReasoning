  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), within a system governed by the linear differential operator \\\\( L(z) = \\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 z \\\\). Analyze the impact of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter observing the system's state at time T, can we deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) changes the initial state in such a way that the effects cannot be uniquely reversed without knowing the use of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\). The integration process embeds the initial conditions into a broader function space, obscuring the unique identification of the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
