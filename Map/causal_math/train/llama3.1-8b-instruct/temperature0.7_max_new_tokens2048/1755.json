  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapped in the complex plane. Analyze the impact of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Az + B \\\\) where A and B are complex constants, over time t.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( S(z) = Cz + D \\\\) (where C and D are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the exerted transformations and not on the initial state?",
  "Explanation": "The intervening transformation \\\\( S(z) \\\\) interacts with the prior states and transformations, complicating the future state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Both the characteristics of the initial state and the effects of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\) influence the final condition at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
