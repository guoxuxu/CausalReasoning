  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x and y are the real and imaginary parts of z respectively, governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is used for transformation of z over time t.\n\nFrom observing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine what interventions (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) took place only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying explicit interventions based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible, as multiple interventional sequences using \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), possibly with varying parameters, can lead to the same or indistinguishable outcomes. The complex factor expansion creates non-uniqueness in deciphering the applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
