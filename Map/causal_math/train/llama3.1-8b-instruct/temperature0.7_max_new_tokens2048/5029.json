  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}t^z \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. The integral is an example of a complex function involving a Mellin transform.\n\nDoes the behavior of the integral \\\\( h(z) \\\\) for \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(s) > 0 \\\\) solely depend on the parameter s without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The convergence and behavior of the integral are directly influenced by the value of s, particularly dependent on the real part of s being positive. Without any other intervention, the parameter s determines the nature of the integral in the given domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
