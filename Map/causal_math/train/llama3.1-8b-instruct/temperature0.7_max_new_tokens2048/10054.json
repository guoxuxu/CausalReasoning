  "Problem": "Examine a system where electric potential V is described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 V = 0\\\\) within a region and manipulate the boundary conditions to observe causal effects. We're especially interested in how transformations such as conformal mappings can infer changes in electric field distributions.\n\nCan one deduce the original domain shape and boundary condition of potential \\\\(V\\\\) from its distribution in a transformation-effected domain without knowing the specific mapping used?",
  "Explanation": "The final distribution of \\\\(V\\\\) does not uniquely encode the original domain or the specific conformal mapping, hence multiple mappings might result in the same transformed potential distribution. Without explicit information on the conformal map applied, multiple original configurations might be plausible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Boundary Condition → Potential V; Potential V → Electric Field; Transformation (Conformal Mapping) → Potential V; Potential V → Domain Shape; Electric Field → Boundary Condition"
