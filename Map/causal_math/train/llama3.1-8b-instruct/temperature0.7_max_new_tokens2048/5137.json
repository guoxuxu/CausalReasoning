  "Problem": "Let's analyze a discrete system defined using the eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of a matrix A. Consider a complex function, \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z - \\\\lambda_i} \\\\), applied to each eigenvalue and its effects on solving the integral, \\\\( \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{f(z)}{z - \\\\lambda_i} dz \\\\) where C is a contour encompassing all eigenvalues.\n\nDoes changing the eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\) of matrix A affect the result of the integral transformation for \\\\( h(z) \\\\) without further external changes?",
  "Explanation": "By changing the eigenvalues \\\\( \\\\lambda_i \\\\), you directly alter the poles of the function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z - \\\\lambda_i} \\\\), which significantly affects the residue computations for the integral. The outcome of the integral transformation is directly dependent on these poles.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
