  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i \\omega z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. We assess the impact of the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) over time t, where \\( \\alpha \\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we determine precisely which interventions were used (whether \\( g(z) \\), \\( f(z) \\), or both), based only on knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\( z(T) \\) may be reached through various combinations of interventions and initial conditions due to the complex exponential nature of the transformations \\( g(z) \\) and \\( f(z) \\). Multiple arrangements can potentially yield the same outcome at \\( T \\), especially considering the overlapping effects of growth/decay and rotations from \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\). Thus, it is impossible to trace back definitively to the specific interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
