  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) describing heat distribution along a rod governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) with constant diffusivity k. Investigate the implications of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} u(x, t)e^{-i\\\\omega x}dx \\\\) applied to this model.\n\nCan we reconstruct the exact initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) from \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) knowing it evolved according to the Fourier-transformed heat equation without knowing the exact form of Fourier transform applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Reversing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) relies critically on knowledge of the Fourier transform applied at t = 0. Without this, the transformation does not uniquely determine the initial state because multiple initial conditions can lead to similar transformed states over time due to diffusion effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
