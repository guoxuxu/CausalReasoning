  "Problem": "Consider a physical system described by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where D is a linear operator. To analyze different scenarios, the Laplace Transform \\( L(x) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}x(t)dt \\) is applied, affecting the system's characteristics over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( x(T) \\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\( L(x) \\), \\( H(x) \\), or both) only by knowing the value of \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of transformations and interventions can lead to the same endpoint \\( x(T) \\), especially if the operators D, L, and H affect the system in non-obvious or non-invertible ways. This overlap in potential state trajectories makes it challenging to uniquely identify the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
