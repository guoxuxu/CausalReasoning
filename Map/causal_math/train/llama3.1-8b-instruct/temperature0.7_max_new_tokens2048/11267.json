  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} x(t) dt \\\\), representing a Laplace transform of a time-domain function \\\\( x(t) \\\\). We explore how applying an integral transformation and its inverse affects our ability to infer causal relationships in the transformed domain.\n\nIf the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is altered at a specific time by an intervention operation (denoted as \\\\( h(x(t)) \\\\) applied discretely at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\)), and then a Laplace transform is applied, will the resulting function \\\\( z(s) \\\\) be merely a direct Laplace transform of the original unaltered \\\\( x(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to a new function, say \\\\( x'(t) = h(x(t)) \\\\), at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\). The Laplace transform of this new function \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) will differ from that of the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\), since the transformation \\\\( h \\\\) has adjusted the function's behavior, altering the Laplace transform result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
