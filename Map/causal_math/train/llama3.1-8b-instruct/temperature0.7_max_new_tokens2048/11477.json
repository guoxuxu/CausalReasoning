  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing trajectories in the complex plane. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is affected by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L(z) = az + b\\\\overline{z} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, and \\\\( \\\\overline{z} \\\\) denotes the complex conjugate of \\\\( z \\\\).\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system evolves under the operator \\\\( L \\\\) without any further interventions, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be solely dependent on the initial application of \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since no further interventions modify the trajectory, and given the deterministic application of the operator \\\\( L \\\\), the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at any later time T is entirely governed by the initial conditions and the continuous evolution dictated by \\\\( L \\\\). The process is linear and deterministic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
