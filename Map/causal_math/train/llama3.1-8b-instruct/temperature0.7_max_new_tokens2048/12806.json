  "Problem": "In a controlled experiment, a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\) is used to modulate an input signal \\\\(x(t)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant frequency. The output signal is given by \\\\(y(t) = z(t) \\\\cdot x(t)\\\\). The goal is to study the changes in the Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) as compared to \\\\(x(t)\\\\) over time t.\n\nIf we change \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to another value \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) and continue to observe \\\\(y(t)\\\\), will the Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) at time T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) still accurately reflect the original frequency content of \\\\(x(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) to \\\\(\\\\omega'\\\\) introduces a new modulation that will again alter the frequency characteristics of the output signal. The Fourier Transform of \\\\(y(t)\\\\) for T > \\\\( t_1 \\\\) will reflect this new modulation, potentially obscuring or distorting the original frequency content of \\\\(x(t)\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
