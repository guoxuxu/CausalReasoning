  "Problem": "Consider the function \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A} B u(s) ds \\), representing the output of a linear time-invariant system with state-space matrices A and B, and input \\( u(t) \\). Let's explore how the introduction of a transformation \\( f(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\), where C and D are constant matrices, affects the system.\n\nIf \\( u(t) \\) is set to a specific function at \\( t = 0 \\) and allowed to evolve through the system without any further transformation applied, will the function \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T \\) remain unchanged irrespective of whether the initial state was transformed by \\( f(z) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( f(z) \\) at the initial state alters the initial condition of the system. Since \\( f(z) = Ce^{Dt}z \\) modifies the output, the resulting function \\( z(T) \\) will deviate from its trajectory if it would have not undergone the transformation needed by \\( f(z) \\). Thus, the final output \\( z(T) \\) depends on the transformation \\( f(z) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
