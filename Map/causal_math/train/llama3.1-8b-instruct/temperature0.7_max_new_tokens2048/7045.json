  "Problem": "We consider a system defined by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Mz \\\\), with M being a complex matrix. The function transformation applied is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\), where N is another complex matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the system \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, would \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T reflect the same results as direct evolution of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under the system for t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions with the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\), which alters the trajectory of the system. The nonlinear interaction between N and M affects the evolution, leading to a different complex vector at any subsequent time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
