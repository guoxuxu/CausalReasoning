  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{iAz} \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and z a complex variable. We examine the effect of an integral tranformation \\\\( h(g) = \\\\int_0^T e^{iBt} g(z) dt \\\\), with B as another constant matrix, over an interval [0, T].\n\nBased on the transformed outcome \\\\( h(g)(z) \\\\) at z = T, can we deduce exactly what interventions occurred (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( j(g) \\\\), or both), solely by analyzing the mathematical form at z = T?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome \\\\( h(g)(z) \\\\) at T is a result of complex interactions between the initial function and the exponential terms contributed by B and potentially modified by C. The integral transformation and the possible intervention with C create a functionally entangled result from which we cannot uniquely extract the sequence or specifics of interventions applied throughout [0, T].",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
