  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\\\\) governing the displacement \\\\(u(x,t)\\\\) of a string, where \\\\(c\\\\) is the wave speed. To analyze this system, we consider the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\kappa, t)\\\\) to the spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\), transforming the equation into a simpler form.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\kappa, t)\\\\) at some time \\\\(t\\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial conditions \\\\(f(x)\\\\) and \\\\(g(x)\\\\) in the spatial domain without prior knowledge of whether a Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "If the Fourier transform was indeed applied, the transformed equation provides sufficient information to reconstruct the initial conditions uniquely. By inverse transforming \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(\\\\kappa, t)\\\\) and its time derivative, one can accurately determine \\\\(f(x)\\\\) and \\\\(g(x)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
