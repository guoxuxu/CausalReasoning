  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) defined in a one-dimensional space. We examine the effects of a Fourier transform applied to u(x,0) to analyze the wave's behavior.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a filtering operation represented by a function \\\\( h(k) \\\\) is applied to the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t_1)\\\\), will the characteristics of the wave at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the original state \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and not on the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the filter function \\\\( h(k) \\\\) modifies the spectral components at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), hence the future state of the wave \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) for t > t_1 will depend on both the original conditions and the effects of the filtering, altering the evolution path prescribed by the wave equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
