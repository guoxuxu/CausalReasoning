  "Problem": "Consider an electrical RLC circuit where the response \\( V(t) \\) over time t is governed by the differential equation \\( L\\frac{d^2V}{dt^2} + R\\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}V = 0 \\), with L representing inductance, R resistance, and C capacitance. We explore the behavior following a Laplace transform of the voltage signal \\( V(t) \\), represented as \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\).\n\nGiven the final Laplace transform \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\) of the circuit's voltage, can we determine precisely when and how the resistance was changed during the circuit operation?",
  "Explanation": "While the final Laplace transform \\( \\hat{V}(s) \\) reflects the overall system response, pinpointing the exact timing and nature of parameter changes such as resistance shifts requires more detailed real-time data or additional knowledge about the system’s intermediate states. The Laplace domain representation compresses time-domain information into a complex frequency domain, obscuring such details.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
