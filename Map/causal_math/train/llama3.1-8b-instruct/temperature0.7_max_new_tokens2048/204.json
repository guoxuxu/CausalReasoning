  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a system governed by a set of linear differential equations \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where \\(D\\) is a diagonalizable constant matrix. Investigate the effects of applying a transformation defined by the complex function \\( g(x) = e^{i\\omega t}x \\) on the system, with \\(\\omega\\) representing a real constant frequency.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\( x(T) \\), can we determine exactly which transformations or interventions were used (whether \\( g(x) \\), \\( h(x) \\), or both) during the system's evolution?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final state \\( x(T) \\), the identification of specific transformations applied earlier is obscured by the compounded effects of exponential and scalar transformations. The interaction of different parameters (\\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\lambda\\)) and their non-trivial effects on system trajectory complicate attributing effects to specific causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
