  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\( z(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwt} \\phi(t) dt \\), where \\( \\phi(t) \\) is a given function and w is a complex parameter. Analyze how the application of the Fourier transform affects the behavior of the function \\( \\phi(t) \\) and its causality in terms of exponential decay functions \\( e^{-at} \\) where \\( a \\) is a positive real number.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\( z(w) \\) observed at time T, can we determine if and when the intervention \\( e^{-bt} \\) was applied, just by analyzing \\( z(w) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The data from \\( z(w) \\) may show the overall effect of exponential decay, but it won't provide precise information about when the intervention started unless additional temporal data or markers of the intervention's onset are available. The interactions between different exponential terms over time make it complex to deduce the exact moment of intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
