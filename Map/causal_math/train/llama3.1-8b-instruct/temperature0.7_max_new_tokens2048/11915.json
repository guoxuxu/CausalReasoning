  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) in the complex domain, defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), representing a unit circle in the complex plane. Evaluate the transformations on this function using the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), where the Laplace transform is given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven only the Laplace domain representation of the endpoint after applying unknown interventions to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we pinpoint what specific interventions (modulations) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Even if certain properties or features in the transform might hint at common modulations, without additional information about the nature and number of interventions, it is challenging to accurately define what specific functions were used to modulate the original. Various different modulations could potentially yield equivalent transformations, leading to ambiguities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(t) → e^(it); e^(it) → Laplace transform; s → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → Endpoint in Laplace domain; Endpoint in Laplace domain → Intervention type"
