  "Problem": "Analyze the feedback system characterized by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\( h(x) = Kx \\\\), where K is another constant matrix, applied at specific instances.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the exact initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on application of \\\\( h(x) \\\\), the impact of the transformation \\\\( Kx \\\\) on the initial conditions is unknown and may not be reversible, especially if K and M do not commute. This makes it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
