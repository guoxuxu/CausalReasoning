  "Problem": "Examine the relationship in a mechanical system governed by the Laplace-transformed equation \\\\(L{\\\\ddot{x} + k\\\\dot{x} + mx} = F(s)\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\), and \\\\(m\\\\) are constants, and \\\\(F(s)\\\\) is the Laplace transform of a force function. We investigate the effects of applying different inverse transformations representing procedural changes.\n\nIf an inverse Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}{F(s)} = f(t) \\\\) is applied to determine the time-domain force function and then the system is allowed to evolve according to its dynamics without any further intervention, will the displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at any time t be solely determined by \\\\(f(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the system is linear and governed by a single input function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) in the absence of further intervention, the displacement \\\\(x(t)\\\\) can be uniquely determined and is directly causally influenced by \\\\(f(t)\\\\) through the system’s inherent dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
