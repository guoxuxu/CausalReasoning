  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) applied on the complex plane excludes zero and analyze its impact using a Laplace transform defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}[f(t)](s) \\\\).\n\nGiven the transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) resulting from an unknown intervention on \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we definitively state which function (either \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or the modified function) was the point of origin?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the nature or existence of an intervention, \\\\( G(s) \\\\) could represent various modifications or even retain the characteristics of the original function, making it ambiguous and preventing a definitive causal inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
