  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transformation of a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) given by \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t))(s) \\\\). Furthermore, let \\\\( x(t) \\\\) interact with another function \\\\( v(t) \\\\) through a convolution, resulting in \\\\( y(t) = (x * v)(t) \\\\) which transforms to \\\\( Y(s) = X(s)V(s) \\\\) in the s-domain.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention by substituting \\\\( v(t) \\\\) with another function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied, will the new resulting transform \\\\( Y'(s) = X(s)U(s) \\\\) for \\\\( s > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and not on the removed \\\\( V(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The substitution of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) with \\\\( u(t) \\\\) changes the convolution dynamics, impacting the transformed function such that \\\\( Y'(s) \\\\) depends on the interaction between \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and the new \\\\( U(s) \\\\), entirely diverging from the influence of \\\\( V(s) \\\\) post-intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
