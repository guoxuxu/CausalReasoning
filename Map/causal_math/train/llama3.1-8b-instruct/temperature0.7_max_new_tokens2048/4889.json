  "Problem": "We consider a dual-space system where two functions are defined: \\\\( f(x) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) \\, dt \\\\) (Laplace Transform) and \\\\( g(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i t x} \\, dt \\\\) (Fourier Transform). Let \\\\( x(t) \\\\) represent an input signal evolving over time.\n\nIf \\\\( f(x) \\\\) (Laplace transform) is computed and no other transformations are applied, does the resulting transformation define the entire original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) uniquely for all cases?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace transform is quite powerful in recovering general signals, certain conditions, such as lack of convergence or presence of non-unique Laplace pairs, prevent it from uniquely defining the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) in every case.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
