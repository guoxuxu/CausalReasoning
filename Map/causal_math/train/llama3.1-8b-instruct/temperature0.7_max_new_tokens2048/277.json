  "Problem": "Consider a mechanical system where the force \\( F \\) applied to an object causes it to accelerate according to Newton's second law \\( F = ma \\), where \\( m \\) is mass and \\( a \\) is acceleration. Suppose a particular transformation \\( h(a) = k \\cdot a \\) defines a modification to the acceleration, where \\( k \\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nIf \\( h(a) \\) is applied initially to modify the acceleration of an object from \\( a_0 \\) to \\( k \\cdot a_0 \\) at time \\( t = 0 \\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\( F = ma \\) without further intervention, will the final position \\( x(T) \\) of the object be the same as if the original \\( a_0 \\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\( h(a) \\) changes the initial acceleration, thus altering the object's velocity and subsequent displacement over time. Applying \\( k \\cdot a_0 \\) results in a different trajectory than just using \\( a_0 \\), leading to a different final position \\( x(T) \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
