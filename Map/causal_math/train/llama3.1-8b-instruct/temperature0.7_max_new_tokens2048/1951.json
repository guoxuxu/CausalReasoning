  "Problem": "Analyze the effects of a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\\\) applied to a continuous function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), especially focusing on integrating this transform into a control system represented by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)\\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and \\\\(u(t)\\\\) is a control input function.\n\nIf an additional transformation is applied to the control input post-Laplace Transform (say, a second transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u)(s) \\\\)), will the resulting system state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) follow a trajectory determined only by the original system design (matrices A and B), independent of the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Any further transformation applied to the control input, like \\\\( \\\\mathcal{G}(u)(s) \\\\), adds another layer of modification, potentially altering the dynamics, timing, and nature of the control actions applied to the system, thus affecting the system's trajectory and not solely being a function of the original matrices A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
