  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Analysis is conducted on the effect of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s)\\\\), which transforms the function of time \\\\(u(t)\\\\) into a function of complex variable s.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\(F(s)\\\\) at some s after evolving under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\(u_0(t)\\\\) at t = 0 without other information?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform can be applied to \\\\(F(s)\\\\) to recover \\\\(u_0(t)\\\\) due to the properties of the Laplace transform being bijective for functions meeting certain conditions like causality and exponential boundedness, which are assumed here.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
