  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a constant complex vector. We are interested in evaluating the impact of the integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iB\\\\tau} z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where B is another real constant.\n\nGiven the transformed state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) after applying \\\\( I(z) \\\\), is it possible to determine the exact sequence of transformations (identifying precise values of A and B) based solely on \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The information at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) post-intervention comprises the effects of both A and B in a compound manner due to the integral and exponential terms. Distinguishing the individual impacts of A and B uniquely is challenging as different pairs (A, B) could yield similar results at \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
