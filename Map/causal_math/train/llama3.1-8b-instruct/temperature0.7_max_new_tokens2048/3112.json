  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\) where M is a constant matrix. We investigate the effect of the transformation specified by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can be extremely difficult due to the potential overlap in effects caused by the exponential transformations \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Et} \\\\). These transformations could yield the same final state under different conditions or combinations, making it hard to definitively conclude which interventions were executed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
