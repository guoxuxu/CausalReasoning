  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-invariant system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We analyze the system's behavior under the transformation \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) for a matrix M.\n\nIf \\\\( g(x) \\\\) transforms an initial state vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and the system evolves according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without further actions, will the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without transformation under the same system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) = Mx \\\\) changes the initial conditions. Because M might not commute with D, the trajectory will be altered, resulting in a state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) that differs from the state obtained by evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( Dx \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
