  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) that describes a two-dimensional motion, where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. The motion is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), with a constant complex matrix \\\\( P \\\\). We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nKnowing only the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclude whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both were applied at any point, based solely on this knowledge?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping influences of the matrix exponentials from \\\\( Q \\\\) and \\\\( R \\\\), along with the base dynamics of \\\\( P \\\\), mean multiple trajectories could converge to the same endpoint. The ambiguity in transformational effects and possible equivalence in resultant states from different interventions precludes definite determination of the applied transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
