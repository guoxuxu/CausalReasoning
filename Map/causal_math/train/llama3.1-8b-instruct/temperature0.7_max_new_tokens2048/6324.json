  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function represents a transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\). We analyze the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) under different conditions with specific transformations applied.\n\nKnowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and that an intervention occurred at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), can we precisely identify the parameters \\\\( a, b \\\\) before \\\\( t_1 \\\\) and \\\\( a', b' \\\\) after \\\\( t_1 \\\\) based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) results from the complex interplay of both sets of parameters. Multiple combinations of \\\\( a, b \\\\) and \\\\( a', b' \\\\) could lead to the same endpoint due to the nonlinear nature of the exponential function in the complex plane, especially when rotations and scalings are involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
