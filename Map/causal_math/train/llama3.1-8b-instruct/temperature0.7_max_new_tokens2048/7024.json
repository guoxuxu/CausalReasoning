  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\), where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are constant matrices, and \\( u(t) \\) is a control function. We explore the impact of a transformation \\( f(x) = Sx \\), where \\( S \\) is a linear invertible matrix applied instantaneously at a certain time.\n\nKnowing the value of \\( x(T) \\), can we conclusively determine which transformations were applied (whether \\( f(x) \\), \\( g(x) \\), or both) by having access only to the state \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying precise interventions purely from the endpoint \\( x(T) \\) is not feasible without additional context or data. Given the linearity and potential combinations of how \\( S \\) and \\( D \\) could affect \\( x \\), multiple combinations could lead to the same \\( x(T) \\). This ambiguity prevents unequivocal determination of past interventions based solely on observing \\( x(T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
