  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a Fourier transform on a time series data \\\\( x(t) \\\\), and consider an operation \\\\( g(x) = x^2 \\\\) applied to it. We consider the variable \\\\( s \\\\) in the frequency domain with transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\).\n\nIf a Fourier transform is applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( X(s) \\\\), and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is a filter applied in the frequency domain, will filtering \\\\( X(s) \\\\) with \\\\( H(s) \\\\) produce the same result as directly filtering \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with its corresponding time-domain filter?",
  "Explanation": "Convolution in time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain. Therefore, filtering \\\\( X(s) \\\\) by \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is equivalent to convolving \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with the corresponding inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The outcome remains consistent due to the properties of the Fourier transform whether applied before or after transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
