  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\) where \\( a \\) is a constant. Study the effect of a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)] \\) on the variable \\( u \\).\n\nGiven the final state \\( u(x, T) \\), can we determine precisely what transformations were used (whether \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), or both), only by analyzing \\( u(x, T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\( u(x, T) \\) can potentially be produced through different combinations of transformations and their interactions. The cumulative effect of \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), alongside the natural evolution under \\( u_t + au_x = 0 \\), creates multiple potential scenarios, which makes it impossible to uniquely determine the interventions just from observing \\( u(x, T) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
