  "Problem": "Consider a controlled system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the linear transformation \\\\( z(t) = C e^{Dt} x \\\\), with C and D being constant matrices and \\\\( x \\\\) as the initial state vector. We explore the implications of performing a Laplace transform on \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to analyze the system in the s-domain, denoted as \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = C(sI - D)^{-1}x \\\\).\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 by knowing the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing \\\\( Z(s) = C(sI - D)^{-1}x_0 \\\\) allows for the calculation of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) if C and D are known and \\\\((sI - D)^{-1}\\\\) is invertible. By inverting the operations properly, the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) can be uniquely determined from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
