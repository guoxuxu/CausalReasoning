  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations represented by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix, x is the vector of variables, and b is the constant vector. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the matrix multiplication \\\\( Mx \\\\), where M is an invertible matrix.\n\nGiven a solution \\\\( x(t) \\\\) that satisfies \\\\( AMx = b \\\\), can it be conclusively inferred that the original system was \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( Mx \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( Mx \\\\) was applied, it is uncertain whether \\\\( x(t) \\\\) solves the original system \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) or the modified system \\\\( AMx = b \\\\). The presence of M alters the solution set unless its effect is specifically neutral with respect to A's solution space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Mx → x(t); x(t) → Ax; Ax → b; b → (Ax = b); (Ax = b) → (Ax = b without Mx); M → invertible; invertible → Mx; (Ax = b without Mx) → (Ax = b)"
