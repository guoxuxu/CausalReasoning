  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), on this system.\n\nGiven the final Fourier-transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), can we precisely determine what operations were performed on \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\) (whether due to L, M, or both), solely from \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple different sequences or types of operations (involving L, M, or their combinations) could yield the same resulting state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), due to the possible overlapping effects in the Fourier domain. The dynamics in the transform space do not allow us to distinctly trace back to each specific operation or interaction in the original function space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
