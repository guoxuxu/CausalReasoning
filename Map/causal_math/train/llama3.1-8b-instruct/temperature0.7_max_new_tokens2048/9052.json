  "Problem": "Assume a function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) represents a complex-valued function where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time. This function is transformed by a complex exponential \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nGiven the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely calculate what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) merely from knowing the final state?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which interventions were used based solely on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible. Multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), or their sequences can lead to identical or indistinguishable effects at T due to the properties of exponential transformations in the complex plane. This non-uniqueness in trajectory outcomes inhibits precise inference of the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
