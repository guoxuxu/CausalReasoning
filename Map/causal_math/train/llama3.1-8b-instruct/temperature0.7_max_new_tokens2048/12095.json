  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), which relates a function in the time domain to its counterpart in the complex, frequency domain. We examine scenarios where transformations such as filtering by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) are applied, and interventions by changing the function's form.\n\nKnowing the final output in the time domain \\\\( m(t) \\\\), can we clearly identify not only the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) but also the sequence and type of filtering operations (\\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( K(s) \\\\)) applied?",
  "Explanation": "Determining both the original function and the details of the operations from just the final output \\\\( m(t) \\\\) is infeasible without additional information. The convolution operations corresponding to multiple filters can lead to various combinations of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and \\\\( K(s) \\\\) producing the same \\\\( m(t) \\\\), thereby making it impossible to uniquely distinguish between the sequences and types of operations based solely on the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
