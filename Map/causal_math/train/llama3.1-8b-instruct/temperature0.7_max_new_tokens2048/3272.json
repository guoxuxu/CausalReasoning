  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}(u(t, x)) = \\\\hat{u}(t, k)\\\\) and its inverse across variable transformations.\n\nIf only the final state \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) is known, can we determine which transformations (initial Fourier transform, intervention with \\\\(h(u)\\\\), or both) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the final state \\\\(u(T, x)\\\\) introduces ambiguity in reconstructing the sequence or type of transformations applied due to the non-linearity and potential superposition of effects from different interventions. This uncertainty makes it challenging to definitively ascertain the exact transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
