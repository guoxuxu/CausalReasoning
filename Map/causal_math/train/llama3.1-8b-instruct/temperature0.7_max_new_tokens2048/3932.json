  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature of an object (T) varies in time and can be modeled by the function \\\\( T(x, t) = u(x) + v(x,t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(x) \\\\) is the initial temperature profile and \\\\( v(x,t) \\\\) represents the effect of external forces changing the temperature over time t. Suppose the effect of an external force is described by the integral transform \\\\( v(x,t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-s)} f(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and f(t) varies non-linearly with time.\n\nGiven the final temperature profile \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\), can we infer whether the standard function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or the intervened function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) was applied during the evolution of the system, just by analyzing \\\\( T(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the mixing effect of the matrix exponential in the transform and the possible similar influences of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) on the temperature, it is challenging to discern from the final profile alone whether \\\\( f(t) \\\\) or \\\\( g(t) \\\\) (or both) were active without more specific information about their functional forms or additional external data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
