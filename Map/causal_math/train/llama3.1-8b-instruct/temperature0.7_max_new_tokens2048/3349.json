  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We examine the effect of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) \\\\) applied to the solution \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) where x is a spatial variable.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform is applied to the initial conditions \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) of \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\), and then the system is evolved according to \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( u(t, x) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0(x) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform changes the initial state from time-domain to complex frequency-domain, which alters how the solution evolves under the differential operator L. The inversion back to time-domain will likely not preserve the original dynamics exactly, leading to a potentially different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
