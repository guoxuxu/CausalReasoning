  "Problem": "In a complex system, let's consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( u(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( U(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{u(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). This transform changes the domain from time to frequency for easier manipulation. The function \\\\( u(t) \\\\) represents a system response and is affected by system properties. An intervention is considered by altering the function through multiplication with another function \\\\( v(t) \\\\), where \\\\( V(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{v(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) is the Laplace transform of \\\\( v(t) \\\\).\n\nBy observing the Laplace transform \\\\( U_p(s) \\\\) at various frequencies, is it possible to clearly identify whether \\\\( U(s) \\\\) was modified from its original form without knowing the transforming function \\\\( P(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without information about \\\\( P(s) \\\\), it is difficult to determine how \\\\( U(s) \\\\) was initially altered to form \\\\( U_p(s) \\\\). The changes introduced in the frequency domain may not be distinguishable as originating solely from the natural system response or the applied modifications.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
