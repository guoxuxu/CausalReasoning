  "Problem": "We consider a linear system transformed by applying a Fourier Transform to its input signal \\(x(t)\\), resulting in \\(X(ω) = ℱ\\{x(t)\\}\\). Let the system be characterized by the differential equation \\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\), where \\(K\\) is a constant matrix, and the output given by \\(y(t)\\) is also transformed, \\(Y(ω) = ℱ\\{y(t)\\}\\).\n\nIf \\(X(ω)\\) is initially computed and the system is allowed to evolve according to \\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\) without any further intervention, will \\(Y(ω)\\) at some frequency \\(\\omega\\) be the differential transformation of \\(X(ω)\\) under the influence of \\(K\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the Fourier Transform is a linear operator and the system is governed by a linear differential equation, the output \\(Y(ω)\\) will be the original input \\(X(ω)\\) modified according to the system's characteristics encapsulated in matrix \\(K\\). The transformation of input leads directly to the prescribed modification in the output in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
