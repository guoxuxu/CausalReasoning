  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent complex function \\\\( f(z, t) = e^{iAt}z \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( Tg(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iBs}g(z) ds \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z, t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( f(z, t) \\\\), it is impossible to revert the operation reliably because the impact of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) on \\\\( z_0 \\\\) might mask the initial conditions irreversibly, especially if A does not commute with B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
