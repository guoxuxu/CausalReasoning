  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a real scalar constant, representing angular frequency in the complex plane. Study the effects of applying an integral transform \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i\\\\omega \\\\), a complex constant.\n\nGiven the output of the transform after intervening by multiplying with \\\\( w(t) = e^{iCt} \\\\), can we precisely isolate the effect of the intervention and calculate \\\\( A \\\\) without knowing \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "If the intervention details are unknown, specifically the value of \\\\( C \\\\), isolating \\\\( A \\\\) from the modified output \\\\( T[u] = \\\\frac{1}{s - i(A + C)} \\\\) is not feasible as the transform's result blends the effects of both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\). Without distinguishing their individual contributions, precise determination of \\\\( A \\\\) alone from the final result is impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
