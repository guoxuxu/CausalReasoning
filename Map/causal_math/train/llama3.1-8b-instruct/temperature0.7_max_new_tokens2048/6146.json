  "Problem": "Consider a function in the complex plane given by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\). We investigate the behavior of this transformation under the action of a linear operator defined by \\\\( L[f](z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw \\), where the operation is along a path in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( L[f](z) \\\\) for some \\\\( z \\\\), can we deduce the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without knowing it was \\\\( z^2 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specifying the original function, the result from \\\\( L[f](z) \\\\) could correspond to multiple plausible functions due to the integral transformation obscuring the precise identity of \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Different functions can give rise to the same integral value over a path, particularly in complex analysis where paths and integration limits are crucial.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
