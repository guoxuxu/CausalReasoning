  "Problem": "Analyze a continuous system handling electric current \\( I(t) \\) governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dI}{dt} = -kI \\), where \\( k \\) is a positive constant. Consider an intervention represented by the function \\( f(I) = AI^2 \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant. This study determines the impact of transformation \\( f \\) over time \\( t \\).\n\nCan we deduce the original current \\( I_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( I(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) without knowing whether \\( f(I) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\( f(I) \\), it's impossible to uniquely backtrack from \\( I(T) \\) to \\( I_0 \\), as \\( I_0 \\) could have been transformed by \\( f \\) leading to different initial conditions. The direct solution from \\( I(T) \\) using \\( \\frac{dI}{dt} = -kI \\) might lead to multiple possible values of \\( I_0 \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
