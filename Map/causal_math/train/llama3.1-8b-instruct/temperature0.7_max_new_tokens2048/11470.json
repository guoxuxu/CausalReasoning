  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and are solutions to the differential equation system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P is a constant complex number and Q is a complex forcing term. The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\\\), with another constant complex number S, investigates the effects on this system.\n\nFrom observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we deduce the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0 without further data?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of the scaling and rotation induced by \\\\( e^{St} \\\\) and the evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz + Q \\\\) result in a complex state that is not uniquely reversible without explicit knowledge of the transformations applied. Multiple initial conditions could yield the same endpoint due to the nature of complex exponential growth.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
