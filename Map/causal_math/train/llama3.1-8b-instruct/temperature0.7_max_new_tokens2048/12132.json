  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. The inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is known to reconstruct \\\\( h(t) \\\\). We explore the impact of modifying \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by a function \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, on the time-domain representation of the function.\n\nIf \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is multiplied with \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and then the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{G(s) H(s)\\\\} \\\\) is performed without further modification, will \\\\( h(t) \\\\) shift in the time domain by \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by \\\\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\\\) and then taking the inverse Laplace transform results in a time shift of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) by \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( h(t-a) \\\\), effectively delaying the response. This shift corresponds to the convolution theorem in the Laplace domain that translates into a time-domain shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
