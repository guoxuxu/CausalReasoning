  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time and solve the coupled differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = ax - by\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = bx + ay\\\\), with constants a and b. We investigate how transformations like \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) affect this system, where C is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the system constants a and b, and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the new function \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) changes the trajectory of the system again. The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will now depend on all constants a, b, C, and D, since these transformations affect both the magnitude and phase of \\\\( z \\\\), influencing the system's evolution in a compounded manner.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
