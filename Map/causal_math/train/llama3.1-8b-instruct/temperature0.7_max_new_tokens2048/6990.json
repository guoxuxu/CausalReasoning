  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation \\( u_t = \\Delta u \\) governing the temperature field \\( u \\) over a domain, affected by an external heat source modulated by the function \\( h(t, x) = e^{-\\lambda t} \\sin(\\omega x) \\), where \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\omega \\) are constants.\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\( u(x, T) \\) at some time \\( T \\), can one determine uniquely whether the external source \\( h(t, x) \\) was applied from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( T \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting temperature profile \\( u(x, T) \\) may resemble one achieved through different heat distributions or initial conditions, compounded by transient heat dynamics and diffusion processes. Without explicit knowledge of the boundary and initial conditions, as well as the specifics of any external influences like \\( h(t, x) \\), reconstructing the exact cause strictly from \\( u(x, T) \\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
