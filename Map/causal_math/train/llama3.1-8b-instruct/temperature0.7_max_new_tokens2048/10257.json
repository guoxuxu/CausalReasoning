  "Problem": "Evaluate the influence of a complex transformation defined by \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) on the stability of solutions to a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = kw \\\\), where k is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( z(w) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( w_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dw}{dt} = kw \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(w(t)) \\\\) at t = T correspond to directly evolving \\\\( w_0 \\\\) under the differential equation and then applying \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(w) = e^w \\\\) and given that the evolution of \\\\( w \\\\) is exponential, the transformation applied initially commutes with the evolution induced by the differential equation. As exp(kw) and exp(w) are eigenfunctions of their derivatives, the proposed sequence (transformation following evolution) will result in the same outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
