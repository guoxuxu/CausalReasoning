  "Problem": "Using a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in a dynamical system, analyze its evolution under a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{d^2z}{dt^2} - az \\\\) with a real constant a. The impact of a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t) is considered.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under the operator \\\\( L \\\\) without knowledge of whether a Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the Fourier Transform was applied initially, it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0. The transformation could have altered frequency components significantly, leading to various possible original functions that could present the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
