  "Problem": "Consider a function described by the linear transformation \\\\( T: \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\) and let \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) where A is a constant matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is an initial complex vector. A transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) is known to be applied, where B is also a constant matrix. The behavior of the system under this transformation over time t is studied.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the system state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Knowledge about the influence of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is crucial as the transformation \\\\( e^{BT}z_0 \\\\) employed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) could alter the state in ways that are not reversible or deducible from the state at T alone, especially if the matrices A and B do not commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
