  "Problem": "Consider the system given by the Laplace Transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We explore the behavior of the system under the transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\), and its inverse Laplace Transform.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and is transformed back using the inverse Laplace Transform without any other manipulation, will the resultant function in time domain be the same as the original \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\\\) changes the original function, and its inverse Laplace Transform does not simply revert to \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Instead, it corresponds to the operation in the Laplace domain that would modify the poles and zeros of the original \\\\( F(s) \\\\), resulting in a different time domain function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
