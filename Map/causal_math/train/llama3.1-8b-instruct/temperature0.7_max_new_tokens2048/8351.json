  "Problem": "Consider a linear differential equation system described by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix. We investigate the effect of a transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T(x) = P^{-1}e^{Qt}Px \\\\) over time t, where P and Q are constant matrices and \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) denotes the matrix exponential of Q.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( S(x) = R^{-1}e^{St}Rx \\\\) (where R and S are constant matrices) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on D and not on Q or S?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( S(x) \\\\) introduces additional factors through matrices R, R^{-1}, and \\\\( e^{St} \\\\), affecting the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). Thus, the endpoint depends on Q, S, and D, reflecting the combined effects of all transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
