  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is a complex initial condition and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the behavior under the transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is another real constant, analyzing the time evolution represented by this transformation.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional function \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the resultant state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced only by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and not by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The applied transformation \\\\( k(z) \\\\) contributes an additional magnitude scaling to the system, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not just on the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), but also significantly on the scalings \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\). Each transformation influences the magnitude, thus altering the total outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
