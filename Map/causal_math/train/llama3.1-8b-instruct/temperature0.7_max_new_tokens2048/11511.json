  "Problem": "We consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which describes a unit circle in the complex plane over time. We examine how the Laplace Transform affects this function and the implications for causally interpreting transformations over time.\n\nIf an intervention using a time-scaling transformation \\\\( z'(t) = z(at) \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant, is applied and then \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z'(t) \\\\} = G(s) \\\\) is computed, does \\\\( G(s) \\\\) still represent the unit circle nature of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The time-scaling affects the frequency and period of the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). This changes how \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) maps onto the complex plane, thus altering its Laplace Transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) and potentially not preserving the characteristics of the original unit circle trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
