  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time describing a physical system. We utilize a Fourier Transform to analyze frequency components, defined as \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf an external force modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), introducing a new frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega_1 \\\\), then does the Fourier Transform solely depend on the natural evolution and not on the interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The imposition of an external force that modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\), especially by introducing a new frequency component, will certainly affect the Fourier Transform. The Transform at any time post-intervention will reflect both the natural frequencies of the system as well as the induced components.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
