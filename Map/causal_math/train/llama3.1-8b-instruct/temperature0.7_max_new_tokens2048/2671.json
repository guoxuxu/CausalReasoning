  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q \\\\), where P and Q are complex constants. We evaluate the influence of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z + S \\\\), where R and S are also complex constants.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ut}z + V \\\\) (where U and V are complex constants) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on P and not on R, U, or S, V?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) injects additional complexity into the system's dynamics, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) a function of P as well as R, U, S, and V. The effects of these transformations are compounded, influencing both trajectory and endpoint of \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
