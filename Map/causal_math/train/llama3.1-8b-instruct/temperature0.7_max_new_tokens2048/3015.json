  "Problem": "Consider a time-varying complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We look at the effects of applying a Fourier transformation defined by the function \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf, during the transformation \\\\( F(z) \\\\), an additional convolution with a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before the Fourier transform is computed, will the resultant \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) still reflect only the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by convolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) prior to computing the Fourier transform results in the Fourier transform of possibly modified frequencies due to the properties of the convolution. \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) will now reflect the frequency content of both \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), not merely the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
