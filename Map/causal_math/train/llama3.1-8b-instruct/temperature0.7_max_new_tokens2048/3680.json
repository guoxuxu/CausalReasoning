  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{at}\\\\) where \\\\(a\\\\) is a complex constant. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) = Z(s)\\\\) is taken to analyze the behavior in the frequency domain. We explore the effects of modifying the exponent by a real number \\\\(b\\\\) through the transform \\\\(f(z) = e^{bt}z\\\\).\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\(Z(s)\\\\) at s = p, can we ascertain exactly what transformations were applied (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both), solely from the value of \\\\(Z(s)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final form of \\\\(Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - (a+b+c)}\\\\) does not provide explicit details on the individual contributions of \\\\(b\\\\) and \\\\(c\\\\) since any number of combinations of these constants can lead to the same sum \\\\((a+b+c)\\\\). This ambiguity prevents definitive tracing of which specific transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
