  "Problem": "Consider a stochastically driven system modeled by the stochastic differential equation \\\\( dX_t = AX_t dt + BX_t dW_t \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are deterministic matrices and \\\\( W_t \\\\) represents the standard Brownian motion. We explore the effects of the transformation \\\\( g(X) = C e^{Dt}X_t \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) are constant matrices and explore the system's evolution.\n\nCan the exact nature of interventions like \\\\( g(X) \\\\) or \\\\( h(X) \\\\), that were used during the system's evolution be determined solely by examining \\\\( X(T) \\\\) at the endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "The stochastic nature and potential compound effects of multiple interventions involving matrices \\\\( C, D, F, \\\\) and \\\\( G \\\\) make it difficult to uniquely back-calculate the exact series or types of interventions used. Similarly transformed states are achievable through diverse paths, especially considering the influence of stochastic variability in \\\\( W_t \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
