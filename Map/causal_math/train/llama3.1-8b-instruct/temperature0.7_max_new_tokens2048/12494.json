  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the integral equation \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-sA}x(s) ds \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and x(t) is an input function. We study the effect of applying a transformation \\\\( T(x) = e^{Bt}x(t) \\\\), where B is another constant matrix, on the input function over time.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( U(x) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\\\) (with C as a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 purely depend on the properties of matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( U(x) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\\\) adds another layer of transformation affecting both the structure of the input and its evolution. The output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) thus becomes dependent not only on matrix A but also on matrices B and C introduced through transformations \\\\( T(x) \\\\) and \\\\( U(x) \\\\), respectively. The integrated effect of these matrices until time T shapes the final form of \\\\( y(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
