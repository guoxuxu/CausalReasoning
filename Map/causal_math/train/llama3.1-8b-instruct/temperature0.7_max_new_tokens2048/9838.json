  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( i \\\\) denotes the imaginary unit. This function is subjected to a Fourier transform, represented as \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nBy observing the Fourier transform result \\\\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\\\), can we conclusively infer the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without any loss of information?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a pure complex exponential function results in a delta function precisely pinpointing its frequency component. Hence, observing \\\\( \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\\\) unequivocally identifies the original function as \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), with \\\\( \\omega \\\\) as its frequency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
