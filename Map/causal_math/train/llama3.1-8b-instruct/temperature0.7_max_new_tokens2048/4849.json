  "Problem": "Analyze a scenario involving a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied on an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) within a linear system governed by \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\). The concern here is how transformations and external interventions affect the evolution of the system over time.\n\nWill the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) evolved from time 0 to T with \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\) result in the same final state at t = T as if it were evolved without applying \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) initially?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the exponential function \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) to the initial value alters the frequency and phase of the system. This change in initial conditions leads to a trajectory that differs from a system that evolves just under \\\\( \\dot{z} = -iz \\\\) affecting the final state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Initial state z_0 → evolution; z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} → transformed initial state; transformed initial state → evolved state; time T → final state; \\dot{z} = -iz → evolution; evolved state → final state at t = T; transformed initial state → final state at t = T; initial application of e^{i\\omega t} → transformed initial state; evolution of system without transformed initial state → evolved state; \\dot{z} = -iz → evolution of system without transformed initial state"
