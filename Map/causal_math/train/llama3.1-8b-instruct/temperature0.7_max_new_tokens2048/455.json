  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i \\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The system's behavior is analyzed after applying the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( L \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number.\n\nIf an intervention involves modifying the differential equation to \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i(\\\\omega + \\\\Delta \\\\omega)z + k \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant shift in frequency, does this affect the result of the Laplace transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onwards?",
  "Explanation": "The change in the frequency term \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\omega \\\\) affects the differential equation’s solution, impacting how the function evolves over time. The Laplace transform, being sensitive to the entire history of the function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward, will reflect these changes, resulting in a different transform than if the original equation had been unchanged.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
