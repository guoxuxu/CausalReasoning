  "Problem": "Investigate the influence of a linear operator transformation \\\\( z = L(x) \\\\) on a vector field \\\\( x \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x = Mx \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. The transformation L represents another linear operator with a constant matrix.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( z = L(x) \\\\) is applied immediately at t = 0 to a vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\), followed by evolution under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x = Mx \\\\) without further intervention, does the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T exactly replicate the result of evolving \\\\( x_0 \\\\) directly under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}x = Mx \\\\) until t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( z = L(x) \\\\) modifies the initial conditions. The trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) would differ unless L commutes with the exponential of M, which generally is not the case. Hence, the state transformations under L can produce a distinct evolutionary path in comparison to the direct evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
