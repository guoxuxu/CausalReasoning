  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. The influence of a linear transformation \\\\( L(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants, is analyzed over time. This transformation modifies the trajectory in the complex plane.\n\nGiven the observation of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine whether the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior information on the constants \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) or baseline measurements at t = 0, it is impossible to uniquely determine if the transformation \\\\( L(z) \\\\) was applied. The effect of \\\\( b \\\\) could potentially be mimicked by different starting phases or frequencies in \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
