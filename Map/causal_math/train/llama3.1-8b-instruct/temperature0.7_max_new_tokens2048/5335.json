  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where c is the speed of sound in a medium. We explore the effect of a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} u(t) dt \\\\), on the transformation of the equation.\n\nIf a filtering process described by \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\), a frequency-dependent function, is introduced as an intervention after applying the Fourier transform, will the solution at t = T still solely depend on the initial behavior of the system?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) modifies the frequency components of the solution according to its transfer function. This alteration impacts the resulting time-domain solution after applying the inverse Fourier transform, meaning the outcome at t = T is affected by both the initial conditions and the nature of \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "c → speed of sound; u → ∂²u/∂t²; ∂²u/∂t² → ∂²u/∂t²; u → F(u); F(u) → H(ω); H(ω) → filtered F(u); filtered F(u) → solution at t = T; initial behavior of the system → u; u → ∂²u/∂t²"
