  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), and its transformation by an integral operator \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\pi e^{-it}z(t) dt \\\\). Analyze this transformation and its properties.\n\nGiven the output of the transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\), can we determine the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time without knowing whether the transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the integral operation by \\\\( T \\\\) is akin to a Fourier transform at a specific frequency, the output, which evaluates to zero, does not provide enough information to uniquely recover the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\). This highlights the loss of original information through the transformation by \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
