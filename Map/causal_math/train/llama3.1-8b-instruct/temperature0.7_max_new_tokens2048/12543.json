  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) in a function space. We apply a Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\), leading to \\\\( U(k) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x)) \\\\) in the frequency domain. The change in the system over time t is analyzed by applying the operator to \\\\( U(k) \\\\) exponentiated by a complex function, specifically \\\\( \\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)U(k) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega = ck \\\\) and c is a constant.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\\\exp(i\\\\omega t)U(k)) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we determine which transformations (\\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), or intervention \\\\( M \\\\)) were applied, solely based on this final state?",
  "Explanation": "The resultant state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) could emerge from several possible combinations of \\\\( L \\\\), \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), and different forms of interventions like \\\\( M \\\\). The overlap in the effects caused by these operations in both time and frequency domains prevents a unique determination of the transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
