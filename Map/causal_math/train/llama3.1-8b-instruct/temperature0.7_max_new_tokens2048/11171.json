  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\(L[f(t)] = F(s)\\\\) of a function. We are examining the influence of an operation defined by the multiplier \\\\( M(s) = s^n \\\\), where n is an integer, on the transformed function.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional transform \\\\( M'(s) = s^m \\\\) (where m is an integer) is applied as an intervention, will the final result \\\\( L^{-1}[G(s)](t) \\\\) for t > t_1 depend only on the initial \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and not on \\\\( n \\\\) or \\\\( m \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent intervention with \\\\( M'(s) = s^m \\\\) introduces further modifications, making the final resultant function dependent not only on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) but also significantly on the applied powers \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\). Each application branches off the resulting function's trajectory, significantly altering its course.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
