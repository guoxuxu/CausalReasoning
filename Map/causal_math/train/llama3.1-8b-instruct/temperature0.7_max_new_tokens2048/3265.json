  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0 \\\\), where A is a constant scalar. We investigate the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on the function u(x, t) and consider its evolution under the given differential equation.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0)) \\\\) is calculated at t = 0 and the result is then evolved according to the differential equation without further transformation, will the inverse Fourier transform of \\\\( u(k,t) \\\\) at t = T yield the same result as directly solving the partial differential equation for u(x,T)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the initial Fourier transform and evolving \\\\( u(k,t) \\\\) under the transformed equation, followed by an inverse Fourier transform, mathematically yields the same result as solving the original partial differential equation. The properties of the Fourier transform preserve the dynamics under linear transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
