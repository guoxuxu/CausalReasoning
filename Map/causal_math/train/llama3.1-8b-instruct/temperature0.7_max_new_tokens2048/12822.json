  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t).\n\nSuppose at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a different transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\alpha \\omega^2 t} z(t) dt \\\\) (where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention. Will the final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on the actions of A and B, assuming \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied prior?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), especially involving a different kind of transformation (e.g., involving squaring the frequency), alters the frequency components that contribute to \\\\( z(T) \\\\), making the final state dependent not only on A and B but also significantly on the effects of \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) and the mapping of \\\\( g(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
