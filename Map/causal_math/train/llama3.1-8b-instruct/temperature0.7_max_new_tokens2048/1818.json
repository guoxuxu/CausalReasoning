  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where z is a complex number. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the integral transformation \\\\( g(f) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\) on the function over various scenarios.\n\nAfter observing the result of the Laplace transform \\\\( g(f) \\\\) for some s, can we deduce the specific value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( f(z_0) = e^{z_0^2} \\\\) without knowing the initial form of f?",
  "Explanation": "Given the result of the Laplace transform, it's impossible to uniquely identify a specific \\\\( z_0 \\\\) that would yield \\\\( f(z_0) = e^{z_0^2} \\\\) without additional information, due to the complex interaction of the exponential square in both the function and the transform integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
