  "Problem": "Analyze the system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We examine the role of applying the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), which transforms the spatial variable to a frequency variable.\n\nIf we apply an additional operator transformation (e.g., a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\)) at time \\\\(t_1 > 0\\\\), will the state \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 only depend on the original differential operator L?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing another transformation like the Laplace transform modifies the system dynamics in a fundamentally different space (from frequency domain to complex frequency domain). This new transformation adds complexity to the system dynamics that depend on the properties of both the Fourier transform and the Laplace transform, hence the final state at time T will inherently also depend on these transformations, not solely on L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
