  "Problem": "Analyze the implications of applying a Fourier transform to a signal and then filtering with a kernel represented by H(s), an analytic function in the complex frequency domain, on the properties of the signal.\n\nAfter observing the modified signal in the time domain, can we deduce the precise form of H(s) used during the intervention without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Inferring the precise form of H(s) from the modified time-domain signal requires information about the original signal's frequency components. Without knowledge of both the original and altered signal characteristics in the frequency domain, or without additional constraints on H(s), it is generally not feasible to uniquely determine H(s).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → frequency domain representation; Filtering with H(s) → modified frequency domain representation; Modified frequency domain representation → modified time domain signal; Modified time domain signal → observed signal; Frequency domain representation → H(s); H(s) → kernel form"
