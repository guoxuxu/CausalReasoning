  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) mapping from time \\\\( t \\\\) in the complex plane to a complex number \\\\( z \\\\). The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) is applied to process the output at different times.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(z) = z + 1 \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on the original transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) and not on the interventions (\\\\( g(z) \\\\) or \\\\( h(z) \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) = z + 1 \\\\) introduce additional factors affecting the state at time \\\\( t = T \\\\). Both modifications (square and addition) significantly impact the trajectory and the resultant output at \\\\( t = T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
