  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) where \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is the Laplace Transform. Let \\( f(t) \\) be a function such that \\( f(t) = t^2 \\). We intervene by adding a constant \\( k \\) to \\( f(t) \\), modifying it to \\( f_k(t) = t^2 + k \\) before applying \\( \\mathcal{L} \\).\n\nAfter computing \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{ f(t) \\} \\) and obtaining a result, can we conclusively determine whether \\( f(t) \\) was exactly \\( t^2 \\) or \\( t^2 + k \\) for some constant \\( k \\) without earlier knowledge of intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of \\( t^2 + k \\) gives \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} + \\frac{k}{s} \\), which can also amount to \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} \\) if \\( k = 0 \\). Thus, without prior knowledge of \\( k \\), determining from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{ f(t) \\} \\) alone whether an intervention occurred is impossible.",
