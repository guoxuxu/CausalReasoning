  "Problem": "Consider a system where stock prices are modeled by a stochastic differential equation \\\\(dS = S(\\\\mu dt + \\\\sigma dW)\\\\), with \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\) representing the drift and volatility parameters, respectively. We further consider the impact of an economic policy intervention which can be modeled by an exponential adjustment factor \\\\(f(S) = e^{\\\\alpha t}S\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), an economic policy reversal is introduced modeled by the function \\\\(g(S) = e^{-\\\\beta t}S\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) is a constant), will the stock price at time \\\\(T\\\\), for \\\\(T > t_1\\\\), depend only on \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\) and not on \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) or \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The interventions with \\\\(f(S) = e^{\\\\alpha t}S\\\\) and \\\\(g(S) = e^{-\\\\beta t}S\\\\) introduce modifications to the trajectory of the stock price. The final state of the stock at time \\\\(T\\\\) will depend not only on the parameters \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\) of the stochastic process but also significantly on the impact of the economic policies represented by \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The stock price S at time T depends on the drift parameter mu and the volatility parameter sigma, as well as the economic policy parameters alpha and beta, through their impact on the adjustment factors f(S) and g(S)."
