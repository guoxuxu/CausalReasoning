  "Problem": "Investigate a control system based on the linear partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. Assess the impact of applying a Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) to the function u(x,t), denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(s,x)\\\\).\n\nIf we apply the Laplace transform to the initial boundary conditions of the PDE at t = 0 and then solve the PDE, would the solution at t = T be the same as directly solving the PDE without applying the Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Using the Laplace transform fundamentally alters the method of obtaining the solution. While both methods can lead to the same symbolic expressions, transforming back from the Laplace domain might introduce complexities or alterations (such as assumptions about convergence or contours in the complex plane) that affect the equivalence of the solutions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Initial Boundary Conditions → Laplace Transform; Laplace Transform → Solution at t = T; Applying Laplace Transform → Solution at t = T; Solution at t = T → Equality with Direct Solution; Applying Laplace Transform → Equality with Direct Solution"
