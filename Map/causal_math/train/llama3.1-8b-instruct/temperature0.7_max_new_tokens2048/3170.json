  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving along the x-axis influenced by a velocity field described by the complex function \\\\( v(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\), where \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) is a complex variable. An integral transform \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the velocity function along specific paths.\n\nGiven the transformed velocity function at a position z_1, can we deduce the original velocity function at z_0 before transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation might obscure the original characteristics of the velocity function due to its dependency on the exponential kernel, making it challenging to reverse the transformation accurately without additional information about the specifics of the initial velocity function or the properties of the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
