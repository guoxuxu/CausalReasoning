  "Problem": "In a control system, the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear system \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t) + u(t) \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. A transformation is applied defined by \\\\( h(x) = e^{Ft}x(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( h(x) \\\\) (i.e., the use of \\\\( e^{Ft} \\\\)), it cannot be definitively concluded whether the observed state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) resulted from the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) or a transformed initial state \\\\( e^{Ft}x(0) \\\\). The transformation could obscure the initial condition.",
