  "Problem": "Consider a space of functions transformed by the Laplace Transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), where an input function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is converted into its Laplacian \\\\(F(s)\\\\). Examining how modifying functions with the multiplication by \\\\(e^{at}\\\\) (where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant) affects inference and predictive capabilities in this transformed domain.\n\nGiven \\\\(F(s-a)\\\\) as the Laplace Transform of some function, can we confidently trace back to the original function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) without knowing the value of \\\\(a\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "A lack of knowledge about the specific shift parameter \\\\(a\\\\) implies that any function resembling \\\\(e^{bt} f(t)\\\\) (for any \\\\(b\\\\)) can result in the same transformed function depending on the chosen \\\\(b\\\\). Hence, without knowing \\\\(a\\\\), determining the exact form of the original function is ambiguous.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
