  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a complex function by the operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\), defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(z)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number and f(z) is a complex function of the variable z. We analyze how this transformation and an additional operator \\\\( \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\) defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{D}(g(z)) = \\\\frac{d}{dz}g(z) \\\\) affect the evolved function over time.\n\nIf \\\\( \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\) is applied to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(z)) \\\\) after its initial transformation, will the result depend exclusively on the properties of s and not on z?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{D} \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(z)) \\\\) modifies the transformed function by deriving it concerning z. Hence, the outcome depends both on s (from the original Laplace transform) and z (from the properties of the exponential function and the effect of differentiation).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
