  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and defined as \\\\( L[f(x)] = x^2f(x) \\\\). We investigate the properties of its responses under different transformation scenarios using the Laplace Transform defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(x)\\\\} = F(s) \\\\) where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( F(s) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely determine the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) if unaware whether \\\\( L \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the operator \\\\( L \\\\) was applied, recovering \\\\( f(x) \\\\) from \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is ambiguous since multiple different functions can result in the same transformed function, especially when transformations like \\\\( L \\\\) that involve nonlinear operations are considered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
