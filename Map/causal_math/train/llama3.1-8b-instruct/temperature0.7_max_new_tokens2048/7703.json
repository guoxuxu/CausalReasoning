  "Problem": "Consider a mapping defined by the integral transform \\\\( X(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\) where x(t) is a time-dependent function and s is a complex parameter. We explore how changes in the time-domain function influence the result of the integral transform and vice versa.\n\nIf a filter function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) is convolved with \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time t = 0 and observed forward, will the transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) only refer to the characteristics of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and not \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) essentially modifies \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to \\\\( x'(t) = (x * h)(t) \\\\). The resultant transform \\\\( X'(s) = X(s)H(s) \\\\) will reflect properties of both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), changing the original characteristics considerably depending on the nature of \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
