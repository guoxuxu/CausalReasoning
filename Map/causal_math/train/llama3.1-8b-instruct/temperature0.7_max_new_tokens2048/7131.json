  "Problem": "Consider the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Mx \\\\) on a vector space, where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Further, analyze how the Fourier transform affects the signal when represented as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int e^{-2\\\\pi ist}x(t) dt \\\\). We examine the transformation sequences and their reversibility in different intervention scenarios.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( N \\\\) is applied to \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) before taking the Fourier transform, will the frequency representation \\\\( F(s) \\\\) exclusively depend on the initial transformation \\\\( M \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of another matrix \\\\( N \\\\) on \\\\( x(t) \\\\) before the Fourier transform creates an additional layer of transformation affecting the resultant \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Therefore, the result will depend on both \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( N \\\\), along with their sequence and properties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
