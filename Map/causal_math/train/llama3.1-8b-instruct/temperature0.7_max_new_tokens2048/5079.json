  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number. We study the influence of the transformation given by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on all parameters: \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\). The transformations \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\beta t} \\\\) introduce compound effects of scaling and rotation, influencing the end state significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
