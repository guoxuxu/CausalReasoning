  "Problem": "Consider a complex function described by \\\\( g(z) = e^{az^2} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. To analyze the transformations, we introduce the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) applied to a different function resulting from the initial function \\\\( g(z) \\\\).\n\nIf during transformation an additional function \\\\( h(z) = z^a \\\\) where \\\\( a > 0 \\\\) is introduced as an intervention at a certain \\\\( z_1 \\\\), will the resulting Laplace transform of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) still solely depend on the initial function \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) at point \\\\( z_1 \\\\), introducing an additional layer of complexity that alters the outcome. Therefore, the result depends on both the original exponential function and the power law introduced by \\\\( h \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
