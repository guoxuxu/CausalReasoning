  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform applied to a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}h(t) dt \\\\). The behavior of the function \\\\( h(t) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) \\\\) is analyzed under different settings, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf an arbitrary continuous function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is added to \\\\( h(t) \\\\) before applying the Laplace transform, will the result \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t) + g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) directly imply the original forms of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of the Laplace transform means that \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t) + g(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) + \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{g(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Without additional information about \\\\( g(t) \\\\), the outcomes for both \\\\( h(t) \\\\) and \\\\( g(t) \\\\) cannot be distinctly inferred from their sum's transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
