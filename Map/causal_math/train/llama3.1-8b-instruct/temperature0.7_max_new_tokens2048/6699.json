  "Problem": "Consider a system function defined by \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{y} dy\\\\) representing an integral transformation of the exponential function. The focus is to analyze the derivative and anti-derivative relationships between transformations.\n\nIf we modify the original integral by introducing a scaling function \\\\(h(x) = 2x\\\\) within the integrand, so the transformed function becomes \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{2y} dy\\\\), will the simple derivative relationship to \\\\(e^{x}\\\\) still hold?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the integrand from \\\\(e^{y}\\\\) to \\\\(e^{2y}\\\\). Consequently, the derivative of \\\\(z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{2y} dy\\\\) is \\\\(e^{2x}\\\\), changing its simple derivative relationship to \\\\(e^{x}\\\\) as seen in the original setup.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
