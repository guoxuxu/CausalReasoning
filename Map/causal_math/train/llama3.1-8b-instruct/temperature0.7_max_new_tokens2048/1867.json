  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined in the complex plane over time, governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{it}z \\\\) is considered for modeling the effect of time-dependent rotations on this system.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via a new function \\\\( S(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant angle) is applied, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the original dynamics \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz(t)\\\\) irrespective of the transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) introduced at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), along with the effect of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) applied at the start. These interventions modify the trajectory by additional rotations distinct from the natural dynamics governed by the system's differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
