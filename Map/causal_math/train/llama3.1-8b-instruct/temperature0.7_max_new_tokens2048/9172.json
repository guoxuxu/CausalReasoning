  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We explore the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), just by knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific interventions solely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the potential overlap in the effects of matrix exponentials \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). These can theoretically yield the same endpoint from different initial conditions and transformation paths, leading to ambiguity regarding the history of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
