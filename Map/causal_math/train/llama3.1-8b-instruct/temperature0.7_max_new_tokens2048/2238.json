  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving over time under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) are constants.\n\nCan we deduce the original signal \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing the output of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z(T)) \\\\) at time T, without knowing the specific form of s?",
  "Explanation": "Without precise knowledge of \\\\( s \\\\), the variation introduced by the exponential term in the integral transformation obscures the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The integration process, influenced by \\\\( s \\\\), entangles the effect in a way that makes isolation of the original cause without additional information impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
