  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Kx\\\\), where K is a matrix. We examine the effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(x) = S^{-1}e^{Lt}Sx \\\\), where L is a diagonal matrix and S is an invertible matrix, over the time t.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) at t = T, without knowing if \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without definitive knowledge regarding the application of \\\\( g(x) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely reverse engineer the state at t = 0 due to the potential manipulation by \\\\( S^{-1}e^{Lt}S \\\\). The altered trajectory prevents the direct deduction of the initial state \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
