  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions describing the system's state over time. We analyze the impact of a Hilbert transform \\\\( H \\\\) which transforms a real function into another real function, typically shifting each frequency component by \\\\(-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) of the function is transformed by \\\\( H \\\\), then allowed to evolve by the original system's dynamics without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) evolve identically to its evolution from \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by the Hilbert transform alters the phase and potentially other properties of the signal’s components. This initial condition change affects the entire trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a different state at time \\\\( T \\\\) than if the transformation hadn't been applied.",
