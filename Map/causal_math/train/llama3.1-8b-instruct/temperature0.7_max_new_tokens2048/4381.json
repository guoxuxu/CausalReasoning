  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2\\\\), where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the effect of a linear transformation \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) applied at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a nonzero complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + kz^2\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be affected by the initial application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\( h(z) = Cz \\\\) scales \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by a constant \\\\( C \\\\), which alters the trajectory from what would have been obtained by evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) directly. The quadratic term \\\\( kz^2 \\\\) in the differential equation amplifies this effect, making the trajectory dependent on the initial scaling.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
