  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i\\omega t + c)} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real positive frequency and \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the influence of an integral transformation \\\\( T_\\lambda [z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{\\lambda s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\), where \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nIf an additional transformation \\\\( T_\\mu [z] \\\\) (where \\\\( \\mu \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied as an intervention halfway through the evolution of the function, will the ultimate outcome at time T depend on the interactions between \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of \\\\( T_\\mu [z] \\\\) overlays a further integral transformation convolved with \\\\( e^{\\mu s} \\\\). The resulting combined transformation details at time T will reflect the inclusion and potential interference between both \\\\( \\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\mu \\\\), altering the trajectory and outcome of the initial transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "λ → T_λ; λ → z; μ → T_μ; μ → z; z → T_λ; z → T_μ; T_λ → T_μ; T_μ → T_λ; T_μ → outcome; T_λ → outcome",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The complex constant λ influences the transformation T_λ, which in turn affects the outcome, while the complex constant μ influences the transformation T_μ, which also affects the outcome, and the outcome depends on the interactions between λ and μ."
