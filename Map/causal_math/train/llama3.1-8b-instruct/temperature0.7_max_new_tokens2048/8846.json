  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by a set of complex functions \\\\(z(t) = U(t)z_0\\\\), where \\\\(U(t)\\\\) is a unitary operator that evolves the state \\\\(z_0\\\\) over time t. We examine the effects of an integral transformation \\\\(T\\\\) defined by \\\\(T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t V(s) z(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), where \\\\(V(s)\\\\) is another operator.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\(z_0\\\\) after observing \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\(T\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\(T\\\\), the modifications made by the integral operator \\\\(V(s)\\\\) are unknown and potentially obscure the original state \\\\(z_0\\\\). The intervening integral transformation means that \\\\(z(T)\\\\) could represent a state influenced by many possible initial conditions convolved with effects of \\\\(V(s)\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
