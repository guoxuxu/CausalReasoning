  "Problem": "Consider a system where the heat distribution \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\\\), with \\\\( k \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore how the Fourier transformation \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at time \\\\( t \\\\) and its modification by a function \\\\( g(x, t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) is a constant, affect the system.\n\nIf \\\\( F(u) \\\\) is computed after \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) evolves by the heat equation for time \\\\( t = T \\\\) without further interventions, does the result of \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) match the initial Fourier transform evolved under the same conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the heat equation solution evolves predictably without any external influences. Therefore, applying \\\\( F(u) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) inherently captures the transformations caused by the heat equation alone, preserving the linear transformation nature under the Fourier analysis.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
