  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We explore the effects of pre-multiplying the input signal by a modulation function \\\\( m(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nKnowing the transformed result \\\\( X(s) \\\\), can we infer the original signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( m(t) = e^{at} \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty if the modulation \\\\( m(t) \\\\) was applied, one would not know to adjust the Laplace variable \\\\( s \\\\) by \\\\( a \\\\) (i.e., transforming \\\\( X(s+a) \\\\) back to \\\\( X(s) \\\\)). Incorrectly assuming the presence or absence of modulation results in an incorrect inverse transformation, hence an incorrect inference of \\\\( x(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
