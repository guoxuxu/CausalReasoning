  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system represented by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) where \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\), with \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) as matrices. We explore the role of a linear transformation represented by matrix \\\\( M \\\\) that modifies the input \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by the function \\\\( f(z) = Mz \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( M \\\\) modifies an initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and the system evolves according to \\\\( L \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), determined by \\\\( L \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\), be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved under \\\\( L \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the initial state with \\\\( M \\\\) before applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\) changes the starting point, thus affecting the evolution of the system. Since \\\\( L(z) = Az + B \\\\), the impact of the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) influences how the vector sequence progresses, introducing a different trajectory than if \\\\( M \\\\) were not applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
