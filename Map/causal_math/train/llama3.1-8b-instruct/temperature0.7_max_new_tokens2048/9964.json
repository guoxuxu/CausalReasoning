  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real parameter representing angular frequency. The function describes a pure harmonic oscillation in the complex plane. Now, consider the transformation \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nConsidering the waveform observed at \\\\( T \\\\), is it possible to conclusively determine whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both were applied during the interval [0, T]?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing only the state at \\\\( T \\\\) does not provide enough information to delineate the sequence or type of transformations applied (either \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both). Multiple transformation paths could result in the same endpoint, especially when the transformations involve nonlinear operations such as powers, which mask the original and intervening influences.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
