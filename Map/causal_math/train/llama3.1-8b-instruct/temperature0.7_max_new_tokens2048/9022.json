  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a set of complex differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a complex matrix. We study the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{St}z dt \\\\), where S is another complex matrix.\n\nCan we deduce the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing about the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is uncertain how the initial conditions were modified by the integral transformation, especially as the matrix S could alter the dynamics in a unique way that cannot be reversed without specific knowledge.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
