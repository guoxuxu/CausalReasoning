  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( s(t) = L[f(t)] \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) describes the evolution of a signal over time. We're studying how the convolution with another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), represented as \\\\( h(t) = f(t) * g(t) \\\\), impacts the transformed system.\n\nIf the convolution \\\\( h(t) = f(t) * g(t) \\\\) is performed initially, and then the system evolves under its natural properties (i.e., only influenced by \\\\( f(t) \\\\)) without further intervention, will the transformed signal \\\\( L[h(t)] \\\\) at a later time be affected by the convolution function \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution effectively changes the initial conditions of the signal. Since \\\\( L[h(t)] = L[f(t)] * L[g(t)] \\\\), the characteristics of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) are inherently embedded into the transformed signal, affecting its subsequent evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
