  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. This function is applied to transform the contour of integration in the complex plane for an integral \\\\(I = \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz\\\\), where \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is a holomorphic function and \\\\(C\\\\) is a simple closed contour.\n\nKnowing the value of \\\\( I' = \\\\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), can we infer the original contour \\\\( C \\\\) with certainty, without information on \\\\( a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the transformation details or the nature of \\\\( a \\\\), it is impossible to revert \\\\( w(C) \\\\) to \\\\( C \\\\) as the mapping \\\\( e^{az} \\\\) might not be uniquely reversible due to its dependency on the complex parameter \\\\( a \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
