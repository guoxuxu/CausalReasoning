  "Problem": "Consider a quadratic integral transform \\\\( G(x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ax^2 + bx} f(t) dt \\\\), with constants \\\\( a, b \\\\) real and positive. The function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a real-valued function. We examine how the transform influences causal relationships by analyzing its effect on a specific function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), and how interventions might affect outcomes.\n\nIf a modification is made to the function \\\\( f(t) = 1024 - e^{-t^2} \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), by applying a scaling factor, say \\\\( f(t) = 2f(t) \\\\), will the transformed function \\\\( G(x) \\\\) be merely scaled by the same factor at all times?",
  "Explanation": "The scaling factor will indeed influence the result of the integral transform, but it will not just simply scale \\\\( G(x) \\\\) by the same factor due to the non-linear interaction within the exponential terms of \\\\( G(x) \\\\). The impact will be more complex than a straightforward scaling, especially due to the presence of the term \\\\(-ax^2\\\\) in the exponential.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
