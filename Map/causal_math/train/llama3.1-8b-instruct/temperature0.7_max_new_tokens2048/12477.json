  "Problem": "In the context of electrical circuits, consider a linear system represented by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The system is subject to the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and produces output \\\\( y(t) \\\\). We explore the effect of a Laplace transform on this system, focusing on the transfer function modification \\\\( H(s) \\\\) changing to \\\\( H(s) + K(s) \\\\), where \\\\( K(s) \\\\) is another transfer function.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) from the modified system, can the original transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) be determined without prior knowledge of the function \\\\( K(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing \\\\( K(s) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( H(s) \\\\) from \\\\( y'(t) \\\\) because multiple combinations of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( K(s) \\\\) could result in the same output signature \\\\( y'(t) \\\\). Thus, there is an inherent indeterminacy in identifying \\\\( H(s) \\\\) solely from the post-modification output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
