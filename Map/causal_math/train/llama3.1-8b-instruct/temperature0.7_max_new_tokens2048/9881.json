  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\nabla^2 u + ku\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a constant. We explore the impact of a Fourier transformation \\\\(F(u)\\\\) applied to the function \\\\(u(x, t)\\\\).\n\nIf \\\\(F(u)\\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) and then allowed to evolve under the original differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\(F(u)(\\\\xi, T)\\\\) at T be equivalent to the Fourier transform of \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) directly computed at T?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of the initial condition modifies the frequency components of the state, which will evolve differently under the diffusion and growth terms \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u + ku\\\\). This results in a different Fourier transform at time T than if the system were evolved and then transformed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
