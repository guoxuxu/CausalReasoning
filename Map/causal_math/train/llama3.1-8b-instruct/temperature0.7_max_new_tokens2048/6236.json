  "Problem": "Consider a control system in which an input vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\) influences the output \\\\( x(t) \\\\) via the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A and B are constant matrices. We investigate the change induced by a transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(x) = Ce^{Dt}x \\\\) where C and D are also constant matrices.\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can the specific interventions applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( j(x) \\\\), or both) be determined solely by knowing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The impact of matrix exponentials on the system's state can allow multiple combinations of interventions to result in the same final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\). The non-uniqueness of the trajectory, given the possible transformations by C, D, F, and G, means it's not feasible to uniquely identify the interventions just from the state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
