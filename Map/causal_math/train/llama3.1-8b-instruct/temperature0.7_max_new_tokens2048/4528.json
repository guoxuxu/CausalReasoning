  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace equation in two dimensions \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) is a scalar potential field. We explore the effects of a transformation defined by \\\\(g(\\\\phi) = \\\\phi + \\\\sin(x + y)\\\\) introduced at a specific location in the domain.\n\nGiven the final observed potential, can we ascertain if a specific transformation (either \\\\(g(\\\\phi)\\\\) or \\\\(h(\\\\phi)\\\\)) or both were applied, solely based on the observation of \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) at the end?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions based only on the final form of \\\\(\\\\phi(x, y)\\\\) is often not feasible, particularly without clear information on initial conditions or the exact nature and sequence of transformations applied. The potential modifications could overlap in effects, making it impossible to distinguish the interventions uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
