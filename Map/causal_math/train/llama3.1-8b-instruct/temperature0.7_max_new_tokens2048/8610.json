  "Problem": "Consider a complex analysis scenario where we study the function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\), applied to a complex variable \\\\( z \\\\). We examine the effects of performing an integral transformation defined by the Laplace transform on this function.\n\nCan we infer the exact value of \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the function value at \\\\( t = T \\\\) without knowing the time passed, based solely on the function value \\\\( w(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely from the function value \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\) at some \\\\( z \\\\) is complex without knowing time T as \\\\( e^z \\\\) has infinitely many antecedents due to the periodic nature of the exponential function in the complex plane (considering multiples of \\\\( 2πi \\\\)).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
