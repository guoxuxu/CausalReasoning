  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of a contour integral transformation on a complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) by proposing the transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_C e^{zt} dz \\\\), where C is a closed contour around the origin and t is a real-parameter.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) without any additional alteration, does the result depend solely on the initial function shape (i.e., \\\\( z^2 \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "Since the transformation involves integrating \\\\( e^{zt} \\\\) along a set contour, the outcome is dictated by \\\\( f(z) \\\\) within the integral, which is \\\\( z^2 \\\\). No other factors influence this transformation's outcome, assuming the contour C and parameter t are fixed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
