  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of the complex transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w \\\\) on a function \\\\( w \\\\) in the complex plane over time t. The function evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}w = iAw \\\\), where A is a constant complex matrix.\n\nIf, at time \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), an intervention by another transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{-it}w \\\\) is applied, will the state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) at time T depend only on A, ignoring the initial and intervening transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) at time T is influenced by both the initial transformation and the intervening transformation. Each exponential function represents a distinct phase rotation in the complex plane, which will influence the trajectory and endpoint depending on their specific interactions with the matrix A and each other.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
