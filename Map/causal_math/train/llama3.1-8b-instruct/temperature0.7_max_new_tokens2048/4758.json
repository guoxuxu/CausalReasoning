  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Du \\\\), where D is the Laplacian operator. Analyze the influence of the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}[u](k) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx \\\\), on the system's behavior over time.\n\nAfter observing the system at time t = T, can you determine the original function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether a Fourier Transform was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a Fourier Transform could have modified the initial state in a way that is not recognizable just from observing the state at a later time, especially without knowledge of whether the transformation was applied. The solution's evolution in the frequency domain could differ significantly from its spatial counterpart.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
