  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation defined by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) on a vector space equipped with a linear operator \\\\( L(v) \\\\). The transformation alters vector \\\\( v \\\\) over time via \\\\( v(t) = e^{Mt}v_0 \\\\). The operator's behavior on transformed vectors is given by \\\\( L(v(t)) = e^{Nt}L(v_0) \\\\) where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via another matrix \\\\( K \\\\) is applied, resulting in \\\\( v(t) = e^{K(t-t_1)}e^{Mt_1}v_0 \\\\), will \\\\( L(v(T)) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) accurately reflect the combined influence of \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( K \\\\) through the application of \\\\( N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( K \\\\) introduces a new dynamic on top of that from \\\\( M \\\\), complicating the direct influence of \\\\( N \\\\) on \\\\( L(v_0) \\\\). The result \\\\( L(v(T)) \\\\) is a compound effect of both transformations, adjusted by \\\\( N \\\\), thus reflecting a combination of these influences, not accurately isolating the effects of either \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( K \\\\) through \\\\( N \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
