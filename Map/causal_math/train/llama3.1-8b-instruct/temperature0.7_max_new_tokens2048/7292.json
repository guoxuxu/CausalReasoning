  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature change \\\\(\\\\Delta T(t)\\\\) in a material is governed by a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d\\\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\\\Delta T\\\\), where \\\\(k > 0\\\\) is a constant related to the thermal conductivity of the material. We examine the effect of an external heating function \\\\( h(t) = H e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\(H\\\\) is a constant heat input.\n\nGiven the final temperature \\\\(\\\\Delta T(T)\\\\), can we specifically determine which interventions (heating, cooling, or both) were applied, assuming only the value \\\\(\\\\Delta T(T)\\\\) is known?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature \\\\(\\\\Delta T(T)\\\\) alone doesn't provide enough information to definitively backtrack and ascertain the types and extents of interventions used. The combined effects of heating and cooling could be achieved in various ways, making it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions just by observing the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
