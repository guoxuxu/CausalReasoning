  "Problem": "Investigate the scenario where a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{Cx} \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, is integrated into the dynamic determined by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}u(x) = Du(x) \\\\), D being another constant matrix. Analyze the evolution when the transformation \\\\( g(x) = z(x) * u(x) \\\\) is introduced.\n\nGiven the system state \\\\( u(X) \\\\), can we uniquely determine which transformations (either \\\\( g(x) \\\\), \\\\( h(x) \\\\), or both) were applied by only examining \\\\( u(X) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The end state \\\\( u(X) \\\\) could potentially result from varying combinations or adjustments of interventions due to the properties of exponential transformations and their potential to create overlapping state results. The indistinctive feature about how exponential matrices influence state trajectories prevents pinpointing the exact interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
