  "Problem": "Assume there is a function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) where \\\\( z \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\) are complex numbers. This function is applied iteratively in the context of complex dynamics, commonly used in generating Julia sets.\n\nIf \\\\( c \\\\) is held constant and the function is iteratively applied starting from an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\), will the sequence \\\\( z_n \\\\) converge to a fixed point as \\\\( n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The convergence properties depend not only on the value of \\\\( c \\\\) but also on the initial value \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Some values of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) might lead to periodically repeating sequences, others to escape to infinity, or to converge to attractors. Therefore, the outcome isn’t necessarily converging to a fixed point without specific conditions on \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
