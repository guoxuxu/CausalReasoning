  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) by applying a complex Fourier transform defined as \\\\( F(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x) e^{-i\\\\omega x} \\\\, dx \\\\). Analyze the impact of a linear differential operator \\\\( L = \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\) on the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and how it affects the transformed function \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention alters \\\\( F_L(\\\\omega) \\\\) by applying another operator \\\\( M = -\\\\omega^2 \\\\), will the resultant Fourier transform depend solely on the original \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) without influence from \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( M \\\\) on \\\\( F_L(\\\\omega) \\\\), which transforms it to \\\\( M F_L(\\\\omega) = \\\\omega^2 F(\\\\omega) \\\\), still carries the effects of both the initial and intervening operations. Thus, it doesn't exclusively depend on \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), but also reflects the influence from applying \\\\( L \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
