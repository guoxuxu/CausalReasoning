  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) described by the integral transformation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} x ds \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) a constant vector. We examine the effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt} z \\\\) over time \\\\( t \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from the integral transformation at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the transformation rule without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the integral transformation was directly applied to t = T without applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt} z \\\\) modifies the initial state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) before it undergoes the integral transformation. The presence of \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) alters the state dynamics from that point onward, leading to a potentially different \\\\( z(T) \\\\) due to the interaction between the matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
