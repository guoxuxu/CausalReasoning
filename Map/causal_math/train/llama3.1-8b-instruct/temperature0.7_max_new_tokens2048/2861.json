  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\\\) where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant, and it's operated on by the Laplace transform defined by the integration transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\). We examine how the operations affect the function over time and how interventions alter its behavior.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), and the function continues to evolve under the original equation without further intervention, does the transformed function \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\) at some real value of s evaluate to the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) had been left to evolve without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform fundamentally changes the representation of the function, converting it from a time-domain to a frequency-domain model. The result \\\\( L[z(t)] \\\\) provides specific frequency domain information which cannot replicate the time-domain function's movement precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform operation → z(t) transformation; s value → Laplace transform operation; z(t) evolution → z(t) transformation; s value → z(t) evolution; z(t) transformation → L[z(t)]; L[z(t)] evolution → L[z(t)]; L[z(t)] evaluation → L[z(t)]"
