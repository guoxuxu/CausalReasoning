  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + pz + q \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are complex numbers. We study the changes in the integral along a path in the complex plane, comparing before and after a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nFrom observing the final integral result along the path from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\), can you precisely identify the alterations made by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) or the mid-path intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The final integral value could be reproduced by a combination of alterations to the function and/or the path. The complexity of possible function transformation and path redefinition does not allow for a unique determination of what changes were imposed based solely on the integral outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
