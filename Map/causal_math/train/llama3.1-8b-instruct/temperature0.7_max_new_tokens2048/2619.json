  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation over complex functions, where the input function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed via a convolution with a kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\), resulting in output \\\\( y(t) = (K * z)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty K(t-\\\\tau)z(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\). The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) to both the kernel and the input function is considered.\n\nIf a Laplace transform is applied as an intervention to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) during the system operation, will the resultant \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be solely dependent on the initial convolution kernel \\\\( K(t) \\\\) without being affected by the Fourier transform applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional transform (Laplace) as an intervention alters the spectral components of the input function, which interact differently under the convolution operation with the Fourier-transformed kernel. Thus, the output will depend on how both transforms (Fourier and Laplace) interact with the native characteristics of \\\\( K(t) \\\\) and \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
