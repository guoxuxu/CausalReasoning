  "Problem": "Assuming a signal processing context where a signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed by a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and subsequently passed through an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[x](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}x(t)dt \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by another operator \\\\( M \\\\) directly on the signal after \\\\( L \\\\) and before \\\\( T \\\\), will the final transform \\\\( T[M[Lx_0]](s) \\\\) be independent of the original operator \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The composite effect of \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) and their sequence will affect the output of the final transform. Characteristics of the signals and operators especially in how operators \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\) may or may not commute with each other and with the transform can lead to dependency on \\\\( L \\\\) even after the intervention by \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
