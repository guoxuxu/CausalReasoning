  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. We evaluate the impact of the Fourier Transform and its inverse defined by the function \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\) and \\\\( F^{-1}(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{2\\\\pi i \\\\xi t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the final state as transformed by \\\\( F^{-1}(z)(T) \\\\), can we decisively determine what specific interventions were applied (whether Fourier Transform, its inverse, both, or another like \\\\( G(z) \\\\)), solely based on the knowledge of the transformed endpoint?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple operations on the complex function, particularly non-commutative transforms like Fourier and other potential transforms, can result in the same final transformed state due to their overlapping influences on frequency and phase components. Hence, it’s impossible to differentiate which specific transforms were applied from the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
