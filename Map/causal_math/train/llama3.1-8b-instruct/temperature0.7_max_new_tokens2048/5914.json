  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical system where the rotation of a vector \\\\(v\\\\) in \\\\(\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\) is defined by a complex function \\\\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\\\theta t}v\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a constant representing angular velocity. The impact of a linear transformation \\\\(L\\\\), defined as scaling by a factor \\\\(s>0\\\\), is used as an intervention.\n\nKnowing the final position of a vector \\\\(v(T)\\\\) after natural evolution under \\\\(f(t, v)\\\\), can we determine the initial vector \\\\(v_0\\\\) without knowing the rotation angle or the duration \\\\(T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific information about \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) and \\\\(T\\\\), the initial vector \\\\(v_0\\\\) cannot be uniquely derived from \\\\(v(T)\\\\) since multiple combinations of these parameters (rotation angle and time) could result in the same final rotated vector.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
