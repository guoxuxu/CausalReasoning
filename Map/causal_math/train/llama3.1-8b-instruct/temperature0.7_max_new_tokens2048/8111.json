  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Dz \\\\), where D is a constant complex number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the behavior of the function under the integral transformation \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int e^{Ut}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where U is a distinct constant complex number, is applied at an intermediate time point, does the final expression of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) for T > intermediate time depend purely on D, independent of S and U?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by another transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces a new variable U, affecting the integration process. Hence, the final output of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is affected by both S and U, and not solely by D. The exponential factors of each transformation complicate the output by contributing their distinct influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
