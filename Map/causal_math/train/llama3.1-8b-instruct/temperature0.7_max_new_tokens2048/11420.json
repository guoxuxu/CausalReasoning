  "Problem": "Consider a series of Fourier transformations applied to a function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which represents a probability density on the real line. Analyze the causal impact of convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( G(x; \\\\sigma) \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) represents the standard deviation of the Gaussian) on the original function.\n\nGiven the final Fourier transformed function after multiple Gaussian convolutions, can we deduce the specific sequence or values of \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\sigma' \\\\) just by observing the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "The specific dampening effects on different frequency components can result from various combinations of \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\sigma' \\\\), leading to multiple plausible scenarios that fit the observed data. The non-unique recovery of sequence or values from the Fourier transformed output precludes definitive inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
