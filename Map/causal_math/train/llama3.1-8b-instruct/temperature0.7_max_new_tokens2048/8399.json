  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a complex function space defined by \\\\( L(f)(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\(z\\\\) is a complex variable. This transformation is the Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\). The causal analysis investigates the role played by the parameter \\\\( z \\\\) in the transformed function and how it affects the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nIf after taking the Laplace transform at \\\\( z \\\\), an operational alteration modifies the function to \\\\( g(t) = t f(t) \\\\) and the transform is recomputed at the same \\\\( z \\\\), will the presence of this multiplication by \\\\( t \\\\) affect the dependency of the resulting transform on \\\\( z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( t \\\\) changes the function and thus the resultant Laplace transform. The new transform becomes \\\\( L(g)(z) = -\\\\frac{d}{dz}L(f)(z) \\\\). As such, the dependency on \\\\( z \\\\) is not only maintained but altered in a specific way that reflects the modification of \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
