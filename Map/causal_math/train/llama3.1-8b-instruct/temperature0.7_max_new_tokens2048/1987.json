  "Problem": "Consider the heat equation governed by \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa u_{xx} \\\\), where \\\\( u_t \\\\) is the time derivative, \\\\( u_{xx} \\\\) is the spatial second derivative, and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the diffusivity constant. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{-\\\\lambda t} \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function \\\\( g(u) = u - e^{-\\\\mu t} \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) is a constant) is introduced as an intervention, will the state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using \\\\( g(u) \\\\) introduces another modifying term, meaning the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) depends on both \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\), as well as \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\). Each of these constants influences how the temperature profile evolves and eventually converges, impacting the resultant distribution at any later time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
