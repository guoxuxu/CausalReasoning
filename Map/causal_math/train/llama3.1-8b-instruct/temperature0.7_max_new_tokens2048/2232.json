  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\) defined on the complex plane where \\\\(x\\\\) and \\\\(y\\\\) are real and imaginary parts respectively, and \\\\(f\\\\) is holomorphic. We transform this function using the Laplace transform on the real part and the Fourier transform on the imaginary part, denoted as \\\\(F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{Re(f(x, y))\\\\}(s) + i\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{Im(f(x, y))\\\\}(\\\\omega)\\\\).\n\nCan we determine from \\\\(F(s, \\\\omega)\\\\) whether an intervention was applied only to the real or imaginary part of \\\\(f(x, y)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\(F(s, \\\\omega)\\\\) does not straightforwardly reveal whether modifications were made solely to real or imaginary components due to the integral nature of the transforms and potential interaction effects in the domain of transforms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
