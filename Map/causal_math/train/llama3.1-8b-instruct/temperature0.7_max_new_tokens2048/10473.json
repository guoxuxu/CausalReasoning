  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the set of complex numbers \\\\( z \\\\), and let's consider an integral transformation of this function, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\).\n\nIf a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) and then the Fourier transform is applied, will the outcome of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(f(z_0)) \\\\) be the same as directly applying the Fourier transform to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then squaring the variable in the frequency domain?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) changes the function prior to the transform application, affecting the Fourier transform result in a fundamentally different manner compared to squaring after the transform due to non-linear transformation properties and the convolution theorem.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
