  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving along the x-axis influenced by a velocity field described by the complex function \\\\( v(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\\\), where \\\\( z = x + iy \\\\) is a complex variable. An integral transform \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) is applied to the velocity function along specific paths.\n\nIf a modification is applied where a new function \\\\( g(z) = z^n \\\\) is used to scale the velocity at a time t_1 after the initial transform \\\\( T \\\\), will the final state of the velocity at z_1 depend only on the original function v without considering the effect of g?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) effectively changes how velocity scales with respect to z, inducing a dependency not only on the original velocity function \\\\( v(z) \\\\) but also on the new function \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Thus, the final state at z_1 is influenced by both the initial function and the nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
