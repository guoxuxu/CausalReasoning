  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( v(p) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-px} u(x) dx \\\\), where p is a complex number. We explore how modifications to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) impact \\\\( v(p) \\\\) through causal inference, particularly examining the effects of differential operators and external interventions.\n\nGiven \\\\( v(p) \\\\), can we uniquely determine if a differential operator was applied to obtain \\\\( u(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed function \\\\( v(p) \\\\) does not uniquely indicate whether a differential operation was applied to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) since multiple functions \\\\( u(x) \\\\) could potentially yield the same transformed result under different operational contexts, particularly without knowing initial or boundary conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "u(x) → v(p); p → v(p); differential operator → u(x); u(x) → u(x) with differential operator; external intervention → u(x); u(x) → u(x) with external intervention"
