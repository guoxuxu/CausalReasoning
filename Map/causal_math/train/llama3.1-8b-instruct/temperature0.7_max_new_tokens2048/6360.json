  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the complex differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z^2 \\), where \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) are constants. We will explore the effects of applying the transformation defined by \\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant, on the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) over time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\( z(T) \\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\( g(z) \\), \\( h(z) \\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The overlap in trajectories resulting from different combinations of exponential transformations and non-linear dynamics makes it challenging to conclusively identify which interventions were applied. Differences in \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) can lead to similar endpoint magnitudes and phases, thereby obscuring the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
