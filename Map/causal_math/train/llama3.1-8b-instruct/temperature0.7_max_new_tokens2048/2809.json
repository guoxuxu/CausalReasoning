  "Problem": "A function optimization process utilizes a Gaussian integral transformation with \\\\( G(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\). This function is utilized to optimize another function \\\\( H(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 4x^2 \\\\) over its domain.\n\nDoes applying the transformation \\\\( G(x) \\\\) on \\\\( H(x) \\\\) without further adjustments result in the minimization of \\\\( H(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( G(x) \\\\) as a multiplier to \\\\( H(x) \\\\) transforms the function, but does not inherently optimize or specifically minimize \\\\( H(x) \\\\). Instead, it modifies the weighting of the function's values across its domain, potentially altering the location and value of minima depending on the behavior of \\\\( G(x) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
