  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane \\\\( z \\\\) described by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z^t dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex parameter. We explore the effects on \\\\( f(z) \\\\) when \\\\( z \\\\) is transformed by a linear function \\\\( g(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) after applying both transformations \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\), can we specifically identify whether both transformations were applied, or either, just by analyzing the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations, being linear, may interact in a way that makes the separable effects on the integral transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) non-discernible, especially without knowing the specific parameters \\\\( a, b, c, d \\\\). The complexity of the parameter interactions in the context of an integral transformation over the complex field ensures that precise identification of interventions from the output alone is generally unachievable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
