  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We explore the behavior of the system under an integral transformation given by \\\\( T[f](z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^{Bt} f(t) dt \\\\), where B is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( w(z) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( T[f](z) \\\\) at z = 0 and then evaluated at z = Z without further alteration, does \\\\( T[w](Z) \\\\) reflect the same outcome as direct evaluation of \\\\( w(Z) \\\\) under the initial function?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[f](z) \\\\) introduces an integral modification to the original function \\\\( w(z) \\\\), fundamentally affecting the results through the interaction between matrices A and B and the integration path, thus altering the outcome at z = Z.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
