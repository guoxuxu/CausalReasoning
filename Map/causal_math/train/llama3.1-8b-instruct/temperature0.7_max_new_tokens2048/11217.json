  "Problem": "Consider a function defined by \\\\( u(x, t) = e^{iwx - iwt} \\\\), a wave equation solution, where \\\\( w \\\\) is a constant. We analyze the effects of applying a differential operator \\\\( L = i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\) to test causal relationships in transformations.\n\nIf the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system evolves under the usual wave equation settings without further modifications, will the transformed solution at t = T be the same as the direct application of \\\\( L \\\\) to the wave equation solution at t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) to the initial condition and allowing the wave equation to proceed naturally leads to the same result as applying \\\\( L \\\\) directly to \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at any later time T. This occurs because the differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) is tied directly to the wave equation's characteristics, and \\\\( L u(x,t) = 0 \\\\) due to the specific form of \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
