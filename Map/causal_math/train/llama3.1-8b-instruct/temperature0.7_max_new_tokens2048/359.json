  "Problem": "Consider a complex integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{C} \\\\frac{e^{zt}}{(z-a)^2} dz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a contour in the complex plane encompassing the singularity at \\\\( z = a \\\\). Analyze how the transformation's effect varies due to perturbing the path \\\\( C \\\\) or modifying the exponential term's coefficient.\n\nIf at a certain parameter \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the coefficient of the exponential term changes from \\\\( t \\\\) to a new value \\\\( t_2 \\\\), will the outcome of the integral transformation depend only on the new coefficient and not on the previous one?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the coefficient in the exponential term affects the entire function being integrated, thus altering the end result of the integral transformation. The final outcome depends on both the original trajectory (prior coefficient values) as well as the intervention point and new terms, as they reshape the functional form inside the contour integral.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
