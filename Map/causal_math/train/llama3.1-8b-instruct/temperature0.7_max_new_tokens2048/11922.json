  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the effects of an integral transform \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{St}z(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( S \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf at some intermediate time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( K[z] = z e^{Ut} \\\\) (where \\\\( U \\\\) is a complex matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced by only \\\\( P \\\\) and not \\\\( S \\\\) or \\\\( U \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Such an intervention with \\\\( K[z] \\\\) introduces additional dynamics via \\\\( e^{Ut} \\\\), impacting the trajectory and final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Thus, the endpoint is dependent on the initial transform \\\\( S \\\\), the later modification \\\\( U \\\\), as well as the inherent system dynamics driven by \\\\( P \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
