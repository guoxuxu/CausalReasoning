  "Problem": "Consider a system influenced by a linear operator described by the matrix equation \\\\( x'(t) = Dx(t) \\\\), where D is a constant matrix. We investigate the behavior of the vector field under the mapping \\\\( h(x) = Mx \\\\), where M is a transformation matrix, by applying it at different times t.\n\nBased on the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we unequivocally identify which transformations (\\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) were applied, merely by knowing the state at \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact sequence or types of interventions used (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) solely from the state at \\\\( x(T) \\\\) is not possible. The non-commutativity of matrix operations and the possibility of similar endpoints from different transformation pathways introduce ambiguity in back-calculating the interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
