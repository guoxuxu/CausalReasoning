  "Problem": "Consider a dynamical system defined by a Laplace transform \\\\( L[s] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}y(t) dt \\\\), where y(t) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = Ky\\\\), with K being a constant matrix. We analyze the effect of applying an exponential matrix function \\\\( h(y) = e^{Dt} y \\\\) where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the Laplace transform \\\\( L[s] \\\\) of the system at time T, can we determine whether the exponential matrix function \\\\( h(y) \\\\) was applied at t = 0, if we have no information about whether an intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of an intervention, the transformation due to \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) modifies the initial condition in a manner that affects the resultant Laplace transform. Multiple cause scenarios due to different values of D could yield the same or sufficiently similar outcomes, making it impossible to uniquely identify the presence of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
