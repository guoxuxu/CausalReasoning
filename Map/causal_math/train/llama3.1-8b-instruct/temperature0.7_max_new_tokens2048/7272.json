  "Problem": "Examine the effect of integrating a complex function using different contours in the complex plane. We consider the function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) varies over different contours.\n\nKnowing only the nonzero value of the integral, can we trace back uniquely to the original contour shape before any deformation?",
  "Explanation": "The same integral result could be obtained from multiple different contours as long as they enclose the singularity \\\\( a \\\\) in the same way. Since the integral's value is invariant to the specific shape of the contour, the original shape cannot be uniquely determined from the integral result alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
