  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) represents a step function. We apply the Laplace transform to this signal and analyze various influence scenarios within the Laplace transform space.\n\nIf the Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}\\\\) is calculated without any modifications, does the transformed function accurately represent the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and discontinuity at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) introduced by \\\\(u(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}u(t)\\\\) correctly accounts for the frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) and the step change at \\\\(t=0\\\\), resulting in \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega}\\\\) for \\\\(s\\\\) with real part greater than 0. This represents both the oscillatory nature and the step effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
