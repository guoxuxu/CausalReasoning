  "Problem": "Consider an engineering structure subject to a loading and unloading sequence. Its response is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} + c \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + k u = f(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u \\\\) is the displacement, \\\\( c \\\\) is the damping coefficient, \\\\( k \\\\) is the stiffness, and \\\\( f(t) \\\\) represents the external force applied to the system. We analyze the model's behavior under the transformation \\\\( h(u) = \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) u \\\\) over time, where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( h(u) \\\\) is applied to the initial condition \\\\( u_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the system's differential equation without further intervention, will the displacement \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the given differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation changes the initial conditions by modifying \\\\( u_0 \\\\). The transformation \\\\( \\\\sin(\\\\omega t) u \\\\) introduces a sinusoidal factor that can significantly influence the response of the system due to the initial phase and amplitude modulation. This significantly alters the trajectory and the resulting final state at any subsequent time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
