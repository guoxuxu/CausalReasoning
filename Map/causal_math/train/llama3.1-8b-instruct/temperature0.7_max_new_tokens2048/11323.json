  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\\\nabla^2 u = 0\\\\) inside a bounded region \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\). If a transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + g(x) \\\\) is applied globally within \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\), where \\\\(g(x)\\\\) is a known function, analyze the various causal influences.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a new transformation \\\\( h(u) = u - g(x) \\\\) is applied, and the system evolves according to the Laplace equation, will the function u at time t = T (T > t_1) revert precisely to the original dynamics as though \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was never applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( h(u) \\\\) effectively counteracts the effect of \\\\( f(u) \\\\) by reversing the addition of \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Thus, after time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), the system will evolve as if starting from the original untransformed \\\\( u \\\\), meaning that at any time T > t_1, the system reflects the dynamics as if solely influenced by the original setup without \\\\( f(u) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
