  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) in the complex plane, governed by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Ny \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. The intervention is introduced by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, applied at a specific time.\n\nIs it possible to accurately trace back to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing if the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied at the start?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), the transformed initial conditions imposed by C are unknown, causing uncertainty in retracing to \\\\( z_0 \\\\). Mixed evolutions driven by matrices M and N, and the unknown initial impact of C, make it problematic to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
