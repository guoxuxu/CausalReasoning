  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, representing a signal at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\. The function undergoes a Fourier transform, yielding the function \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\).\n\nGiven the resulting spectrum \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\), can we determine exactly which frequencies were present initially and which were added as interventions based only on observing \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The spectrum \\\\( Z(\\\\omega') \\\\) may show multiple peaks corresponding to different frequencies, but it cannot specify which frequencies were part of the original signal and which were introduced later. Further, phase and amplitude information that could distinguish between original and intervention frequencies is not retrievable solely from the magnitude of the spectrum.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
