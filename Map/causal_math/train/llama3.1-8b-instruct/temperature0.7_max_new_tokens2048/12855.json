  "Problem": "Consider a chemical reaction where the concentration of a substance \\\\( C(t) \\\\) evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dC}{dt} = kC \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a reaction rate constant. We analyze how applying a transformation \\\\( f(C) = e^{-kt}C \\\\) affects the system over time.\n\nGiven the final concentration \\\\( C(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which intervention (either \\\\( f(C) \\\\), \\\\( g(C) \\\\), or both) was used, simply based on \\\\( C(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the influence of exponential factors in both \\\\( f(C) \\\\) and \\\\( g(C) \\\\) and their potential to produce similar or identical end concentrations through different paths, it's impossible to uniquely and definitively specify which interventions were applied only from observing \\\\( C(T) \\\\). Multiple combinations of k and l values, as well as intervention timings, could yield the same final concentration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
