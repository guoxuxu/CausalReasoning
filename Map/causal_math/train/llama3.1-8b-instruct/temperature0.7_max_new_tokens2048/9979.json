  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) that represents a complex function on the complex plane, given by \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\). For a complex domain transformation defined by \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\), we investigate how this affects the mapping of points over an interval from x = 0 to x = 2\\\\pi.\n\nIf at x = \\\\pi/2, an intervention by another transformation \\\\( v(z) = z^3 \\\\) is applied, will the final traveling on the w-plane from 0 to 2\\\\pi be confined only to the unit circle?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention alters the trajectory: initially, \\\\( z(x) \\\\) maps to a simple circle by \\\\( w(z) = z^2 \\\\), but post-intervention, \\\\( v(z) = z^3 \\\\) at x = \\\\pi/2, changes the path radically. \\\\( z^{3} \\\\) when \\\\( z = e^{i\\\\pi/2} \\\\) (i.e., i) is \\\\( i^3 = -i \\\\), affecting subsequent points and potentially going beyond the unit circle.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
