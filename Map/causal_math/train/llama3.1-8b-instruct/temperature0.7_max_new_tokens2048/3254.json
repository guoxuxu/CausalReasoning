  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(z = x^T C x + bx\\\\), where x is a vector, C is a symmetric matrix, and b is another vector. We are examining the effect of the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Dx\\\\), where D is a regular matrix, on the output z.\n\nGiven the observed value of z, can we determine the initial vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\(h(x)\\\\) was applied, it is problematic to uniquely backtrack to \\\\(x_0\\\\) because both x and Dx could potentially yield the same z, owing to the ambiguity introduced by the linear and quadratic transformations involving C and b.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
