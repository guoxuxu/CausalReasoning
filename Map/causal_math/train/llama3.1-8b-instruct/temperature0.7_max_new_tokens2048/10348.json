  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform in signal processing, where the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We explore the effects of pre-multiplying the input signal by a modulation function \\\\( m(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real number.\n\nGiven the transformed signal \\\\( X(s) \\\\) at s = s_0, can we determine precisely which modulations were applied (whether \\\\( m(t) \\\\), \\\\( n(t) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( X(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) could lead to the same shift in the Laplace variable (i.e., the combined effect of \\\\( a+b \\\\) could result from various pairs of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\)). Without additional information about the individual modulation values, precise determination of specific interventions is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
