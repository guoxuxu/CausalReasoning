  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{f(t)\\\\} = F(s)\\\\) used to solve differential equations. Assume the system is initially impacted by a function \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\), and later, an intervention using the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\{h(t)\\\\} = H(\\\\omega)\\\\) applied to the result.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is transformed via Laplace and evolves under its system dynamics without further intervention, will the final Laplace domain representation be purely based on \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, the Laplace transform applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) will directly reflect the characteristics of \\\\( t^2 \\\\). The final state in the Laplace domain will only encapsulate the properties of the initial function based on its inherent Laplace transform, without any external alterations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
