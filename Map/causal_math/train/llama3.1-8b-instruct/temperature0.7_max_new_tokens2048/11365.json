  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a stochastic differential equation \\\\(dx = (Ax + u)dt + BdW\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are constant matrices, \\\\(u\\\\) is a control input, and \\\\(dW\\\\) represents the increment of a Wiener process. We analyze how the output function \\\\( f(x) = Cx \\\\) behaves under different conditions, where \\\\(C\\\\) is a constant matrix outputting the observable state.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) of the system is perturbed and evolved under the given stochastic differential equation without further control input changes \\\\( u = 0 \\\\), will \\\\( f(x(t)) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) be linearly dependent on \\\\( f(x_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since the control input \\\\( u \\\\) remains zero and the matrix \\\\( A \\\\) governs the autonomous system's dynamics linearly, the output \\\\( f(x(t)) = Cx(t) \\\\) remains linearly related to \\\\( f(x_0) = Cx_0 \\\\) due to the linearity of matrix multiplication and the solution path of the differential equation. Noise induced by \\\\( dW \\\\) affects the magnitude but preserves linear dependency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
