  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a vector function \\\\( z = h(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x \\\\, dt \\\\) over a time period T, where A is a square matrix. We examine the changes induced by applying a transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\), where D is a constant matrix.\n\nBy examining the result \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from the function \\\\( h(x) \\\\), can we infer the initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) used, without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(x) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(x) = Dx \\\\) can alter the initial condition in a way that is indistinguishable after integration unless additional information about D is known. Since D can significantly alter the initial state, different initial vectors could produce the same integrated result depending on the nature of D and A.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
