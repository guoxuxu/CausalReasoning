  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x,t) \\\\) governed by the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is the Hamiltonian operator. Let's analyze the effect of an external operator \\\\( U(t) = e^{-iBt} \\\\), where B is a constant operator, applied as a transformation on the wave function.\n\nCan we deduce the original wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x,0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( \\\\psi(x,T) \\\\) without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( U(t) \\\\) was applied at some point?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether or not \\\\( U(t) \\\\) was applied, and at what times if so, the original wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x,0) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined. This is because the operator \\\\( U(t) \\\\) could have altered the state of the system in a way that makes it irreversible or indistinguishable due to the non-commutative nature of B and H.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
