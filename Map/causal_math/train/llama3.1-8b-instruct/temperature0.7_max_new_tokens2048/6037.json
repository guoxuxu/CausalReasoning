  "Problem": "We examine a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) denote the real and imaginary parts of \\\\( z \\\\) respectively. The system evolves according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. Let us explore the impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z(t)) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( F(z(t)) \\\\) is computed on the evolved state \\\\( z(T) = e^{AT}z_0 + (e^{AT} - 1)A^{-1}B \\\\) at T, will the Fourier transform's outcome from \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be identical without applying Fourier to the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and evolving?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform after the system's evolution includes the effect of both A and B within the system dynamics, which alters the frequency components. This is different from transforming the initial state alone and then trying to evolve it under the dynamical law, due to the non-commutative nature of the operations involved.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
