  "Problem": "Study a system governed by \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), where \\( a, b, c \\) are constants, and consider the integration through a transform \\( T(z) = z^3 \\) applied to the variable \\( z = x + iy \\), where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nConsidering the observation of \\( S(T(z)) \\) satisfying \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), can we differentiate whether \\( T(z) \\), \\( S(z) \\), or both were applied based exclusively on the final observation?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complex and non-linear nature of the transformations \\( T(z) = z^3 \\) and \\( S(z) = z^2 \\), multiple paths through \\( z \\) space can lead to outcomes that satisfy the equation. Thus, it's impossible to uniquely identify which transformations or their combinations were applied merely by knowing the final state satisfies \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
