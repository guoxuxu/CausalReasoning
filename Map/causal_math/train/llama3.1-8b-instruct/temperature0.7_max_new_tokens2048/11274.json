  "Problem": "Consider a linear partial differential equation governed by \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. Evaluate the role of the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = U(s) \\\\) on this system, considering both forward and reverse implications in variable transformations.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform \\\\(U(s)\\\\) of a function \\\\(u(t)\\\\) that solves \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), can we unequivocally retrieve the exact function \\\\(u(t)\\\\) without knowing initial conditions explicitly?",
  "Explanation": "While the Laplace Transform encodes all information about the function over its entire domain, retrieving the original function \\\\(u(t)\\\\) accurately from \\\\(U(s)\\\\) requires explicit knowledge of initial conditions, which are critical to reverse the transform completely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
