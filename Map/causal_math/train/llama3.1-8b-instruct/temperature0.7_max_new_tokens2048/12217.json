  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\) where C is a constant matrix. We examine the implications of a functional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) applied at time t, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing that the system operates under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Cz\\\\), can we accurately trace back to determine whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "If both D and C are unknown, determining whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied initially by just observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is challenging, as \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\) may configure the initial state in different possible ways. Without explicit information on matrix D, multiple configurations could theoretically result in the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
