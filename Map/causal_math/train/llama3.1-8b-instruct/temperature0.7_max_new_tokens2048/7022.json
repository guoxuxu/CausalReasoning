  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu \\), where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are constant matrices, and \\( u(t) \\) is a control function. We explore the impact of a transformation \\( f(x) = Sx \\), where \\( S \\) is a linear invertible matrix applied instantaneously at a certain time.\n\nBy observing \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we infer the initial vector \\( x_0 \\) without knowledge of whether \\( f(x) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the information on whether \\( f(x) \\) was applied and considering \\( S \\) could any invertible matrix, establishing the initial state \\( x_0 \\) from \\( x(T) \\) is complicated unless further specifics of \\( S \\) or the properties of \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are known, leading to ambiguity in reconstructing the actual initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
