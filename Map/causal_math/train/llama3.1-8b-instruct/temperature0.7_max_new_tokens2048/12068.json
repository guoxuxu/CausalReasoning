  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a linear operator in a complex function space, and \\\\( x \\\\) is an initial complex function. We explore the impacts of a Laplace transform intervention defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), analyzing its interactions over various scenarios.\n\nIf we directly compute \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from the given \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) equation and compare it to the outcome of evolving the original function \\\\( x \\\\) under the same operation for time T without any transformations, are they the same?",
  "Explanation": "By definition, applying \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) to \\\\( x \\\\) for a period T precisely yields \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Therefore, there's no difference between the direct computation from the original formula and the evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) under \\\\( e^{At} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
