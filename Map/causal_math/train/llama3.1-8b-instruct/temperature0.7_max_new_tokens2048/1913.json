  "Problem": "Consider a linear algebra problem where the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) is studied under different transformations. Here, C and D are matrices, and \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We analyze the outcome when transformations \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\\\) are applied, where F and G are also constant matrices.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and this state is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\) without further intervention, does the presence of transformation \\\\( h \\\\) result in the same final state at t=T as just evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) under \\\\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition by transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) into \\\\( e^{F0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and evolving under different dynamics, the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) will be affected by F initially, resulting in a potentially different state at time T than by just using D on \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
