  "Problem": "Consider a Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Suppose the inverse transform \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a complex function of time and it's subjected to various operations like multiplication by an exponential function or convolution.\n\nGiven the result of convolution in the time domain, can we determine whether a direct multiplication or convolution occurred in the s-domain, merely by observing the output \\\\( f(t) * g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The time-domain convolution output \\\\( f(t) * g(t) \\\\) does not uniquely specify the type of operation performed in the s-domain (multiplication or convolution of another form). Multiple possible transformations in the Laplace domain can lead to the same convolution outcome in the time domain, thus preventing unique inference about the original s-domain operation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
