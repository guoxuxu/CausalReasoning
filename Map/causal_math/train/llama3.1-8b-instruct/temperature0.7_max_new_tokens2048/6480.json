  "Problem": "A vector field $V(z)$ in the complex plane behaves according to the equation $V(z) = z^n$ where $n$ is an integer. We examine the consequences of applying a transformation $f(z) = e^{i \\theta}z$ where $\\theta$ is a constant angle.\n\nGiven the endpoint $V(z(T))$, can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether $f(z)$, $g(z)$, or both), just by knowing the value of $V(z(T))$?",
  "Explanation": "The final output $V(z(T))$ can result from different angles of rotations provided by $f(z)$ and $g(z)$. Due to the complex exponential function’s property of angle addition, multiple combinations of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ might result in the same endpoint after exponentiation, obscuring the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
