  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\), where M is a constant matrix and N is a constant vector. The system is subjected to an integral transformation given by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt'}N dt' \\\\).\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied initially to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be unaffected by \\\\( h(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by adding an integrated effect of N over the period from 0 to T, driven by exponential terms of M. This changes the trajectory of the system from what would have been observed if only \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + N\\\\) were allowed to act on \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
