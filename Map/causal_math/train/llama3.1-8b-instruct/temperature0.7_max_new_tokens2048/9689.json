  "Problem": "Consider a transfer function in a linear time-invariant (LTI) system given by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), where 'a' is a constant. We analyze the influence of performing an inverse Laplace transform under the scenario of differentiating the impulse response associated with H(s).\n\nIf the impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) derived from \\\\( H(s) \\\\) by the inverse Laplace transform is differentiated with respect to time 't', is the resulting function entirely governed by the constant 'a'?",
  "Explanation": "The differentiation of the impulse response function, which is \\\\( h(t) = e^{at}u(t) \\\\) (where u(t) is the Heaviside step function), results in \\\\( h'(t) = ae^{at}u(t) \\\\). This transformation is directly governed by the parameter 'a', indicating that the cause (differentiation) leads to an effect that is solely dependent on 'a'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
