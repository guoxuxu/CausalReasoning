  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\\\) where A is a real scalar constant, representing angular frequency in the complex plane. Study the effects of applying an integral transform \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s = \\\\sigma + i\\\\omega \\\\), a complex constant.\n\nGiven the outcome of the transform \\\\( T[z] \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original function's parameter \\\\( A \\\\) assuming no prior intervention?",
  "Explanation": "From the transform result \\\\( T[z] = \\\\frac{1}{s - iA} \\\\), it is possible to solve for \\\\( A \\\\) by extracting the imaginary part of the denominator when given \\\\( s \\\\) and the outcome. The relationship is direct and allows back-calculation of \\\\( A \\\\) with accuracy, assuming \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( T[z] \\\\) are known.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
