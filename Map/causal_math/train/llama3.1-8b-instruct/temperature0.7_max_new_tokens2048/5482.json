  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time t. The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. We investigate the system's change under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where Q is another constant complex number.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be precisely retraced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The possible transformation by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) can fundamentally change the initial state. Without knowing about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), determining \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) becomes non-unique, as different Q values can lead to the same outcome through different initial conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
