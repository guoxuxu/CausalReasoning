  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function space, defined as \\\\( Lf = \\\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \\\\. The Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{f}(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) is used to analyze the system.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to \\\\( g(x) = f(x) + h(x) \\\\) at some point after \\\\( L \\\\) is applied and before Fourier transforming, does the resulting Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) still merely reflect the operations of \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by adding \\\\( h(x) \\\\) changes the function to which \\\\( L \\\\) is applied, and thus the resulting Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{g}(k) \\\\) reflects both the effect of \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and on \\\\( h(x) \\\\). The transformation and the addition of \\\\( h(x) \\\\) will both be evident in the Fourier space.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
