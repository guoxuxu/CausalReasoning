  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) with \\\\( A \\\\) being a complex number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) the initial complex value. We explore how a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( B \\\\) is another complex number, influences \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be equivalent to directly evolving \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Implementing the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the original state by scaling it, which alters the trajectory. Depending on the relationship between \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\), the evolution may follow a completely different path, leading to a unique state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
