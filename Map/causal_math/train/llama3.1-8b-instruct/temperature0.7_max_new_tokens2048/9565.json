  "Problem": "Consider a function defined on complex numbers, \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We will study the changes in the function with respect to the integration operator over time defined as \\\\( F(t) = \\\\int_0^t z(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), and analyze the influence of modifications by derivative with respect to time.\n\nIf we evaluate \\\\( F(t) \\\\) from time 0 to T without any additional transformation or intervention on \\\\( z(t) \\\\), will \\\\( F(T) \\\\) be the same as that obtained from direct integration using the original function formula for z(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Direct integration of \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) from 0 to T yields \\\\( F(T) = \\\\int_0^T e^{i \\\\omega t} dt \\\\), and performing this operation without modifying z(t) will result in the calculated value, as no transformation is applied to alter the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
