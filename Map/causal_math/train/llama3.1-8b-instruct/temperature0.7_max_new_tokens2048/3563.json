  "Problem": "Consider a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) represents temperature distribution in a material and \\\\( k \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity. To test the effect of a spatial transformation, let's apply a rotation matrix \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) to the spatial coordinates.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional spatial transformation \\\\( R(\\\\phi) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the system's behavior at time \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) be a direct consequence of only the heat equation properties and the initial rotation \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying a new spatial transformation \\\\( R(\\\\phi) \\\\) further modifies how the heat diffuses, making the future state dependent on \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\), \\\\( R(\\\\phi) \\\\), and the diffusion properties of the material. The compositional effect of these transformations makes the final state influenced by multiple factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
