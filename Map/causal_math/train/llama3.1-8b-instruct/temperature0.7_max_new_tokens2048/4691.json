  "Problem": "Consider a heat transfer system modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = a^2u_{xx}\\\\) (typical heat equation) in a rod, where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant diffusivity property of the rod. We analyze the effect of applying a Fourier transform \\\\(F(u(x,t)) = \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t)\\\\) and then solving the equation in the transform domain.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of altering diffusivity parameter \\\\(a\\\\) at a specific time \\\\(t_1\\\\) is applied, will the solution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 strictly follow the altered parameter, regardless of initial and boundary conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the fundamental dynamics of the equation, and thus the solution depends on the new value of \\\\(a\\\\) as well as any residual effects from the initial and boundary conditions. The whole system's response is dependent on a combination of these factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
