  "Problem": "Consider a two-dimensional system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = M u\\\\), where M is a matrix giving the linear transformation on vector \\\\(u\\\\). We investigate the effects of applying a complex function transformation \\\\( g(u) = \\\\cos(\\\\omega t)u +\\\\sin(\\\\omega t)u \\\\), with a constant \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), over time interval t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) could potentially be reached by multiple combinations of interventions or even by the natural evolution under M, complicated by interventions \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( h(u) \\\\). Due to the non-linearity and potential time-dependent effects of these transformations, identifying the exact sequence and nature of interventions based solely on \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is infeasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
