  "Problem": "Consider a feedback control system where the state vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = A x + B u\\\\), with A being the system matrix and B the input matrix. The input \\\\( u \\\\) is a function of time and defined by an integral transformation \\\\( u(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) x(s) ds \\\\), where K is a kernel matrix function.\n\nGiven the state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine the exact form of the kernel matrix function \\\\( K(s) \\\\) used throughout the interval [0, T] without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) can result from various configurations of \\\\( K(s) \\\\), and without additional information about how \\\\( u(t) \\\\) was influenced or how \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolved over time, \\\\( K(s) \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The kernel matrix function K(s) is directly influenced by the state vector x, which in turn is influenced by the input u, which is determined by the integral transformation of the kernel matrix function K(s) and the state vector x."
