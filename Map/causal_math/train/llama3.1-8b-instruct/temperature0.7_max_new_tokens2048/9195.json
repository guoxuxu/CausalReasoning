  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) ruled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Az + Bz^2 \\\\), where A and B are constants. We investigate the impacts of the linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) where C is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new matrix function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (where D is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on A and B and not on C or D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(z) \\\\) applies additional transformation at time t_1, which alters subsequent dynamics, making the system dependent on C and D as well as A and B. The transformations introduced by C and D impact how the terms in the nonlinear differential equation contribute to the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
