  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t and i is the imaginary unit. The function is transformed by an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} f(t) e^{-st} dt \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T[z](s) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely recover the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without any additional information or assumptions?",
  "Explanation": "Provided that \\\\( z(t) \\\\) satisfies conditions such as being piecewise continuous and of exponential order, and the integral transform is known for a sufficiently large range of s values, then the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be uniquely determined by the inverse Laplace transform. This recovery is unique under these conditions due to the properties of the Laplace transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
