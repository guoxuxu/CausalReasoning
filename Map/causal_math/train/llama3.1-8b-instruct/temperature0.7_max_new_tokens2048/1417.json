  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of an integral transformation on a function's Fourier transform. Suppose we have a function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) and we apply the transformation \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\). Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) as applied on both \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( T(g)(x) \\\\).\n\nWill the Fourier transform of the transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(g))(\\\\omega) \\\\) be equal to the Fourier transform of the original function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) without any other transformations except for \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) fundamentally changes the function \\\\( g(x) \\\\), turning it from \\\\( \\\\sin(x) \\\\) to its integral, which alters both the function's domain and the behavior across the domain. Thus, their Fourier transforms will also differ, reflecting changes in the frequency domain representation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
