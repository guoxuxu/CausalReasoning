  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 q}{dt^2} + R\\frac{dq}{dt} + \\frac{1}{L}q = 0 \\), where \\( q(t) \\) is the charge, \\( R \\) is the resistance, and \\( L \\) is the inductance. Let's analyze the effect of introducing a sinusoidal voltage source \\( V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\) and its impact on the steady-state solution of the system.\n\nIf the sinusoidal voltage \\( V(t) \\) is applied at t = 0 and the system is allowed to evolve under the natural dynamics of the differential equation without further intervention, will the charge \\( q(t) \\) at t = T solely depend on the characteristics \\( R \\) and \\( L \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the external sinusoidal voltage source \\( V(t) \\) changes the system behavior, leading to a forced response in addition to the natural response. This affects the total charge \\( q(t) \\) at time T, making it also dependent on the amplitude \\( V_0 \\) and the frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the sinusoidal source.",
