  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal impact in a nonlinear system characterized by the function \\\\( z = f(x,y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\\\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are variables. We consider the application of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to variable \\( z \\).\n\nKnowing \\( g(z) \\) at a time \\( T \\), can it be determined if any intervention occurred, assuming no prior information about \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without prior knowledge of the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) and considering the complex and sensitive nature of the function \\( g(z) = e^{z} \\), it is challenging to determine if an alteration like \\( z' = z + c \\) occurred or not. The exponential function could mask subtle or even significant changes in \\( z \\) induced by different combinations of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) or by interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
