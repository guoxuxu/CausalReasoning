  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz + B \\\\cos(t)z \\\\), where A and B are constant real numbers. The study involves a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{-Ct}z \\\\) applied to \\\\( z \\\\), where C is also a constant real number.\n\nIf a new operation \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) (D being another constant) is applied at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) as an intervention, would the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > t_1 rely only on the variable A, disregarding the impacts of B, C, and D?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( k(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) introduces additional complexity, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent not just on A but also on B, C, and D. Each of the terms contributes through their own exponential influence on the system's dynamics, impacting the ultimate path and final state at \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
