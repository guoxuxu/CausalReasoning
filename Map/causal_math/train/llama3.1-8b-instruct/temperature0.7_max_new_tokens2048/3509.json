  "Problem": "Consider a linear system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) at any given time \\\\( t \\\\) is governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\), with a control input \\\\( u \\\\). Here, A is a constant matrix defining the system dynamics and B is the control matrix. An operator applies a transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\), where C is another constant matrix determining a specific kind of state transformation.\n\nDoes the transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) applied at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) affect the evolution of the state \\\\( x(t) \\\\) under the system dynamics \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) without any further control adjustments (i.e., \\\\( u = 0 \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(t) = e^{Ct}x \\\\) modifies the initial condition by setting a different starting point for the system's evolution. Therefore, even with \\\\( u = 0 \\\\), the resultant trajectory of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) will differ because the system evolves from this altered initial state, influenced by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
