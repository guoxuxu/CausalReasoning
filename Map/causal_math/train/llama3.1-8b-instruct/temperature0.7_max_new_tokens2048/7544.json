  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\cdot x \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a fixed complex vector, and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number. The function governs the time evolution in a complex function space and represents a circular motion in the complex plane. We examine the impact of a linear transformation \\\\( T: \\mathbb{C}^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}^n \\\\) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce both the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) and the characteristics of the intervening transformation \\\\( T \\\\) solely from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at a later time \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the linear and periodic nature of the transformation and the evolution function, multiple different combinations of original vectors and transformations can lead to the same observed endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This non-uniqueness means neither the initial condition nor the specific intervention can be precisely determined from the final observed state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
