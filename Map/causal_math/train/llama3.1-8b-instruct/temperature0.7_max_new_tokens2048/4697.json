  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the function starting at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under its own dynamics without further intervention, will the functional form of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) accumulates the effects of the exponential function over time, altering the path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) due to the integral, thus leading to a different outcome at time T compared to an unmodified evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
