  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit that can be modeled as a linear system governed by \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a matrix representing the circuit parameters, x is the voltage across various components, and b is the input current source vector. An integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(x) = \\\\int_a^b x(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is applied to observe accumulated voltage responses over time.\n\nCan we deduce the exact input current vector \\\\( b \\\\) after observing the transformed output \\\\( T(x) \\\\) between time a and b without knowledge of the initial values of x?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(x) \\\\) provides aggregated information over the interval [a, b], and without information about the initial voltage \\\\( x \\\\) or the dynamics of A, multiple configurations of \\\\( b \\\\) could result in the same transformed output. Therefore, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\\\( b \\\\) from \\\\( T(x) \\\\) alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
