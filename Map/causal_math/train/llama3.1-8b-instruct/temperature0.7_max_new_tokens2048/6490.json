  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + i v(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), respectively. We aim to explore the behavior of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) under the transformation defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\), the Laplace Transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), the Laplace Transform of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), can one unequivocally recover \\\\(z(t)\\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform, under proper conditions, uniquely represents its time-domain function, allowing for the exact recovery of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) via the inverse Laplace Transform, provided \\\\(z(t)\\\\) adheres to the needed conditions like continuity and exponential boundedness.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
