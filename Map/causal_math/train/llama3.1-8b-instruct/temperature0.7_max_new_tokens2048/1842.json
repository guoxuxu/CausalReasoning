  "Problem": "Assume a system where the Laplacian operator \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) governing heat distribution in a two-dimensional plane. Consider further if the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined as \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int u(x,y) e^{-x^2-y^2} dx dy \\\\) is applied to evaluate system behavior over time.\n\nGiven the value of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at t = T, can we determine the exact distribution of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether any transformations were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) integrates out some information about the spatial distribution of \\\\( u \\\\), and the evolution under the heat equation could lead to many possible initial configurations of \\\\( u(x, y) \\\\) that might yield the same value of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) at T. Reconstruction of exact initial conditions from the integral value alone is underdetermined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
