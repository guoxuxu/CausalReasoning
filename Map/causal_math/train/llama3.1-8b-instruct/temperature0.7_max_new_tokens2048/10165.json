  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\), which transforms a time-domain function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) into its Laplace Transform domain representative \\\\( F(s) \\\\). Suppose an original function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) where A is a scalar, and its behavior under perturbation represented by \\\\( g(t) = e^{-Bt}f(t) \\\\), where B is also a scalar.\n\nIf \\\\( g(t) = e^{-Bt}f(t) \\\\) is applied to function \\\\( f(t) = e^{At} \\\\) from the beginning, will \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\) equal \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\\\) when evaluated at the same \\\\( s \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( g(t) \\\\) changes the form of the original function, adjusting the decay rate from \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( A-B \\\\). Therefore, the Laplace transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) results in \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(A-B)} \\\\), which is different from \\\\( F(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-A} \\\\) unless \\\\( B = 0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
