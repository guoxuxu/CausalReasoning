  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant real number representing angular frequency. We examine changes when applying a transformation \\\\( g(z) = kz \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant, modifying the amplitude and phase.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = kz \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 = 1 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is evaluated with no further transformation, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T > 0 be the same as directly evaluating \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Transforming \\\\( z_0 \\\\) by \\\\( g(z) = kz \\\\) modifies the initial condition, affecting both the magnitude and phase of the resultant complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). This results in \\\\( z(T) = k e^{i \\omega T} \\\\), which differs from \\\\( e^{i \\omega T} \\\\) unless \\\\( k = 1 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
