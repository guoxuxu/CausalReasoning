  "Problem": "Analyze the transformation of a function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, where \\\\( z(x) = x^2 + i \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\) is a real variable. The impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) on this function is examined over a variable s, which is a complex number.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( z(x) \\\\) immediately after knowing \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) without understanding the characteristics of the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without specific details about the Laplace transform applied (i.e., the effects and behavior across the complex plane), retrieving the precise form of \\\\( z(x) \\\\) from \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) is not feasible due to the variability in potential inverse transformations in the complex setting.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
