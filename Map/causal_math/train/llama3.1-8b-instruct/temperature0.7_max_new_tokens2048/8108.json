  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\), representing the Laplace transform of a time-dependent function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Let the causality of this transformation be examined considering both linear differential equations and external interventions in the form of multiplicative exponential functions.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( H(s) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations or interventions (e.g., \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) or both) were used based solely on the value of \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even if the general form of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) suggests exponentials, the exact identification of matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and/or \\\\( B \\\\) used in interventions would require additional information. Multiple combinations of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) could lead to similar or indistinguishable results in \\\\( H(s) \\\\), especially if \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) commute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "z(t) → z(t) is time-dependent; z(t) → H(s); e^(At) → e^(At) is multiplicative; e^(Bt) → e^(Bt) is multiplicative; H(s) → H(s) is linear; H(s) → z(t) is inverse Laplace transform; A → e^(At) is parameter; B → e^(Bt) is parameter"
