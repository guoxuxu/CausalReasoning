  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time, evolving according to the linear differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\), respectively. A Laplace transform is applied to both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), creating a transformed function \\( Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s) \\).\n\nCan we determine precisely whether an intervention occurred on \\( x(t) \\) or \\( y(t) \\), or both, just by observing \\( Z(s) \\) at certain values of s?",
  "Explanation": "The alterations in \\( x(t) \\) or \\( y(t) \\) resulting from interventions would modify \\( X(s) \\) or \\( Y(s) \\) respectively, yet observing \\( Z(s) \\) could be insufficient to distinguish which of \\( x(t) \\) or \\( y(t) \\) was altered, especially without explicit knowledge of the nature and time of intervention. Both components affect \\( Z(s) \\) and could produce overlapping effects in the Laplace domain.",
