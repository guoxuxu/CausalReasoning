  "Problem": "Consider a system where the behavior of a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time is determined by its Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\. Suppose we apply the inverse Laplace transform after manipulating the function in the s-domain by multiplying with a transfer function \\\\(H(s)\\\\).\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified in the s-domain by multiplying with a transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) to get \\\\( Z'(s) = Z(s)H(s) \\\\), then transformed back using the inverse Laplace Transform, will the resulting time function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) be the same as the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without the multiplication by \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) in the s-domain alters the characteristics of the original function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). This manipulation changes the behavior of the system dependent on the properties of \\\\( H(s) \\\\), leading to a different time-domain function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) after applying the inverse Laplace Transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
