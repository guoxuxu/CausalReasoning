  "Problem": "Consider the balance of a linear mechanical system with mass, spring, and damper. The governing differential equation is \\\\( m\\\\ddot{x} + c\\\\dot{x} + kx = 0 \\\\), where m is mass, c is damping coefficient, k is spring constant, and x is displacement.\n\nIf the system starts at rest with initial conditions \\\\( x(0) = x_0 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{x}(0) = 0 \\\\), and evolves naturally according to the given differential equation, will the displacement at any time \\\\( t \\\\) be affected by a change in damping coefficient \\\\( c \\\\) but not the initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The displacement \\\\( x(t) \\\\) over time is influenced directly by its initial conditions as well as the parameters m, c, and k. A change in c affects the system's damping behavior, but the outcome at any time \\\\( t \\\\) still fundamentally depends on the initial conditions set.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
