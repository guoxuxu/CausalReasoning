  "Problem": "Imagine a function \\( z(t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + P(D)z = 0 \\), where \\( P(D) \\) is a linear differential operator. We study the effect of the Fourier transformation \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), which transforms \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\) is computed at an initial time \\( t = 0 \\) and then \\( z(t) \\) is evolved based on its governing equation until \\( t = T \\), will the spectral distribution \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) \\) be the same as if \\( z(t) \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) and then transformed?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity and time-invariance of the linear differential operator \\( P(D) \\) ensure that the Fourier transform of the solution at any time \\( t \\) can be derived directly from the Fourier transformed initial condition. The temporal evolution of \\( z(t) \\) and its subsequent transformation will yield the same result due to the compatibility of the Fourier transformation with linear time-invariant systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
