  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. To analyze causal effect and intervention, we study the system's behavior under a transformation defined by \\\\( T(u) = e^{Mt}u \\\\), where M is a linear operator.\n\nKnowing the final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which interventions (\\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( S(u) \\\\), or none) were applied, based solely on the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) might be achieved through various combinations of applying \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( S(u) \\\\), or neither, due to the potential non-exclusive effects of the transformations. The overlapping impacts and interactions between M, N, and L make it challenging to definitively conclude the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
