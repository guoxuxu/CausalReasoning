  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a region where the velocity field is represented by a vector field \\\\( \\\\mathbf{v}(x,y) \\\\). We are interested in analyzing the result of applying a rotational transformation described by the function \\\\( R(\\\\theta) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\theta) & -\\\\sin(\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\theta) & \\\\cos(\\\\theta) \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\) on this velocity field over an angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nIf at time t_1 an additional rotational transformation \\\\( R(\\\\phi) \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the resultant velocity field at time T > t_1 be dependent only on the natural fluid dynamics and not on the angles \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Both the initial rotational transformation \\\\( R(\\\\theta) \\\\) and the subsequent intervention \\\\( R(\\\\phi) \\\\) modify the velocity field's orientation and interaction dynamics. The fluid's behavior at time T will reflect a composition of these rotations, making it dependent on both angle variables in addition to natural flow patterns.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "time t1 → time T; time t1 → angle θ; angle θ → R(θ); R(θ) → velocity field; R(θ) → resultant velocity field; R(θ) → R(φ); R(φ) → resultant velocity field; fluid dynamics → resultant velocity field"
