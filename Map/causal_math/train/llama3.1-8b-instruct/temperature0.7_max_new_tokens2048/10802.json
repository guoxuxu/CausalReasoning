  "Problem": "Consider the complex function defined as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). Investigate the effects of a transformation by matrix \\( M \\) where \\( M \\) effects the amplitude and frequency. The transformed variable is \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\). Let's analyze using variable separation and integral transformations.\n\nIf the trajectory \\( w(t) \\) is observed until t = T, can we deduce the exact initial matrix \\( M \\) used during transformation of \\( z(t) \\) at t = 0 given no further data?",
  "Explanation": "Since multiple matrices may result in similar transformations depending on their eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and given the complex function evolution, it's impossible to uniquely retrieve \\( M \\) without additional constraints or information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
