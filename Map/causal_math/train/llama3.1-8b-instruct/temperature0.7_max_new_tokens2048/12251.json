  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the system's state over time t. Let's analyze the impact of the Laplace transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\\\) on this complex function.\n\nKnowing the outcome of \\\\( F(s) \\\\) after an intervention was applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), can we distinguish whether the intervention was \\\\( z(t) = z(t) + t^2 \\\\) or \\\\( z(t) = z(t) + t^3 \\\\) just by analyzing the transform at s = 2?",
  "Explanation": "At s = 2, the Laplace transform of both potential interventions (\\\\( t^2 \\\\) and \\\\( t^3 \\\\)) will affect the outcome, but distinguishing between these specific forms based on the transform at s = 2 can be ambiguous without additional frequency-domain or time-domain information to pinpoint the nature of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "t → z(t); z(t) → u(t); z(t) → v(t); z(t) → F(s); F(s) → outcome; intervention → z(t); z(t) + t^2 → z(t); z(t) + t^3 → z(t); F(s) at s=2 → distinguishability"
