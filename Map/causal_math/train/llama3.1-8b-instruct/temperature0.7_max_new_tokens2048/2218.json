  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. An integral transformation \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s} z(s) \\\\, ds \\\\) is considered, which affects the function over time span [0, T].\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) for 0 ≤ t ≤ T after observing the transformed function \\\\( \\\\hat{z}(T) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation with the damping factor changes both the amplitude and potentially the phase of the original signal in an irreversible manner. This transformation cannot generally be inverted without additional information, as multiple different functions could result in the same outcome under this transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
