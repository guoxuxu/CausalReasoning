  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) applied to a signal in the context of Fourier Transform, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. The ability of the system to represent different frequency components is evaluated.\n\nIf a modulation by magnitude \\\\( A \\\\) and an additional constant phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\), represented as \\\\( g(t) = A e^{i(\\omega t + \\phi)} \\\\), is applied to the original signal as an intervention, will the Fourier Transform spectrum still indicate the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) predominantly?",
  "Explanation": "Despite the intervention by scalar amplitude \\\\( A \\\\) and phase shift \\\\( \\phi \\\\), the principal frequency component of the signal remains \\\\( \\omega \\\\). The Fourier Transform detects this component, although the spectrum would also reflect the introduced amplitude and phase shift effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
