  "Problem": "Consider a control system influenced by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the scenario under the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Sx \\\\) applied at time t, with S also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(x) = Px \\\\) (where P is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the system state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 exclusively rely on M and not on S or P?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing \\\\( k(x) = Px \\\\) as an intervention adds a new layer of complexity. The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on M, S, and P, as the intervention modifies the trajectory again, layering effects due to S at the start and P at \\\\( t_1 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
