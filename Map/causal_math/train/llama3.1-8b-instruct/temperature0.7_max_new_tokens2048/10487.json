  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a time-varying admittance matrix \\\\( Y(t) \\\\), and a network described by the voltage-current relationship \\\\( I = Y(t)V \\\\). We examine the impact of a transformation represented by the matrix function \\\\( P(t) = e^{Qt} \\\\), where Q is a constant matrix, that affects the voltage vector over time.\n\nIf, at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( S(t) = e^{Rt}V \\\\) (where R is a constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the resulting endpoint \\\\( I(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( Y(t) \\\\), and not on \\\\( Q \\\\) or \\\\( R \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(t) \\\\) introduces an additional modifying layer, making the final current vector \\\\( I(T) \\\\) dependent on both the transformations \\\\( P(t) \\\\) and \\\\( S(t) \\\\), represented by matrices Q and R respectively, as well as the admittance matrix Y(t). These transformations affect the resulting voltage and thus the current regardless of how Y(t) evolves.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
