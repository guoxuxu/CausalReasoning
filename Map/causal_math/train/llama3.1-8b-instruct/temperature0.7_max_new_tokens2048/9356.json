  "Problem": "Consider a time-dependent complex function \\\\( f(z, t) = e^{iAt}z \\\\), where z is a complex variable and A is a constant matrix. We examine the impact of the transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T \\\\) such that \\\\( Tg(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{iBs}g(z) ds \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( Tz(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z, t) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the output \\\\( Tz(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different sequences or types of interventions involving varying matrices A, B, and C can lead to the same endpoint due to the complex ways these matrix exponentials may interact. This makes it impossible to uniquely identify the interventions purely based on the final transformed state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
