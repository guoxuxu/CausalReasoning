  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\\\), where \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and \\\\(y(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a particle's position in the complex plane. Assume the evolution of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real constant frequency. An integral transform \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega s}z(s) ds\\\\) is considered to analyze the system at different instances.\n\nBased on observing the output of \\\\(f(z)(T)\\\\), can we trace back the exact original state \\\\(z_0\\\\) without knowing the functional form of \\\\(f(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\(f(z)\\\\) produces a cumulative measure of the state's evolution, obscuring the exact initial state \\\\(z_0\\\\) due to the integration over time, which cannot be uniquely reversed without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
