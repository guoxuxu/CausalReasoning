  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by Laplace's equation in a complex domain, \\\\( \\\\Delta u = 0 \\\\), for a function \\\\( u: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\). We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) applied to an initial condition \\\\( u_0(z) \\\\), evaluated at complex number z, and how its impact is observed over space without and with additional transformations.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u_0) \\\\) is applied and then allowed to propagate under Laplace's equation without further intervention, will the transformed state at any complex z, \\\\( u(z) \\\\), be the same as directly solving \\\\( u(z) \\\\) from \\\\( u_0(z) \\\\) under Laplace's equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform changes the initial state's spatial frequency components. The propagation under Laplace's equation from this new state cannot replicate the original evolution from \\\\( u_0(z) \\\\) because it's now operating over an altered spectral composition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
