  "Problem": "In a complex analysis setting, consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency and t represents time. The impact of the integral transformation defined by a convolution integral \\\\( g(t) = (h * z)(t) \\\\) over time t, with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) being another function, is analyzed.\n\nBased on the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) observed at time T, can we unequivocally reconstruct the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) used in the convolution?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution mixes multiple time instances of function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), smeared by \\\\( h(t) \\\\). Without knowledge of \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it is impossible to deconvolute the contributions uniquely and recover the exact form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
