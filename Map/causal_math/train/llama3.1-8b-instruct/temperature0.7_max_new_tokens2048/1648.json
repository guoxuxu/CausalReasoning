  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\) where A is a complex constant. We then apply a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, to the function at time t.\n\nBased on the end function \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately specify which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The determination of specific interventions based solely on the outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is highly challenging due to potential overlapping effects and non-unique mappings caused by complex exponential transformations. Multiple combinations of transformations could lead to similar or indistinguishable results, making it impossible to conclusively determine the pathway from the effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
