  "Problem": "Focusing on a complex function scenario, consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( H(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{h(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Now, assume a scenario where two complex functions, \\\\( p(t) \\\\) and \\\\( q(t) \\\\), are related by the integral transform \\\\( q(t) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} p(t) dt \\\\), representing the convolution in the Laplace transform space.\n\nCan the application of a transformation and subsequent observation of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) clearly indicate whether the external intervention, such as applying \\\\( r(t) = e^{dt} p(t) \\\\), was used, based solely on the transformed output?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexities and possible overlapping effects in the Laplace transform, the resulting function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) alone might not clearly indicate the precise intervention applied, such as \\\\( r(t) = e^{dt} p(t) \\\\). Multiple potential transformations and interventions could lead to similar effects in the resulting function, thus ambiguity persists in detecting specific interventions from the transformed output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
