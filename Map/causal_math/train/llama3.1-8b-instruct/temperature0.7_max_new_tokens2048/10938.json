  "Problem": "Consider a complex system modeled by the equation \\\\( z'(t) = Mz(t) \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a square matrix. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Ns} z(s) ds \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( N \\\\) is another square matrix.\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we definitively trace back the original function before the integral transformation was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) obscures original properties of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), particularly due to the integral nature which mixes the function's values over an interval. With only the resulting \\\\( z(T) \\\\), the exact pre-transformation state of the function is untraceable without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
