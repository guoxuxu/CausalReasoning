  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}u \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex constant vector. This function is acted upon by a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( R(z) = Dz \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another complex constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be exclusively determined by the initial application of \\\\( A \\\\) and not by \\\\( C \\\\) or \\\\( D \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced significantly by the transformations \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) as well as the matrix \\\\( A \\\\). The application of \\\\( R(z) \\\\) further modifies the trajectory, resulting in an outcome influenced by \\\\( e^{iAT}CDu \\\\), intertwining the effects of all matrices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
