  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions and their derivatives are effected by the Laplace Transform. Here, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ u(t) \\\\} = U(s) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ v(t) \\\\} = V(s) \\\\), with s representing the complex frequency domain.\n\nGiven the observed final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which functions or modifications were applied (specifically if the intervention of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) was used) based solely on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could potentially have been reached through different paths with different interventions in the system's dynamics, particularly due to overlapping effects and the generic challenges related to the inverse Laplace Transform. Specific characteristics of \\\\( w(t) \\\\) might not be deducible uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without further information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
