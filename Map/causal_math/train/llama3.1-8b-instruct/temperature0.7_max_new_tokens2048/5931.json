  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a complex constant. The influence of a Laplace transform \\\\( L \\\\) defined by \\\\( L(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) is analyzed over a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a new operation \\\\( M(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-ut}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) (where \\\\( u \\\\) is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention at a certain time \\\\( T \\\\), will the future behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > T \\\\) depend only on \\\\( P \\\\) and not on the nature of \\\\( M \\\\) or \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention \\\\( M \\\\) introduces additional effects on the system by transforming \\\\( z(t) \\\\) up to the time \\\\( T \\\\). This, together with any prior transformation by \\\\( L \\\\), alters the subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), making its future state dependent on the actions of both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\), beyond just the direct influence of \\\\( P \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
