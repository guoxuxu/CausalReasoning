  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the impact of a transformation defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) modifies the initial state by scaling \\\\( z_0 \\\\), which changes the trajectory of the system. The growth factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) influences how the solution to the differential equation unfolds over time, leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
