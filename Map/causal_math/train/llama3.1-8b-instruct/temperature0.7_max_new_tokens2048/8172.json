  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation described by \\\\( y(t) = L[x(t)] \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a function in time. We investigate the causal relationships under the application of the Fourier Transform \\\\( F \\\\), a complex integral transformation defined for function \\\\( x(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the final observed state of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) after applying both Fourier and Laplace Transforms at different times, can you determine the specific sequence or type of transforms applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) could be achieved through different transformation paths due to overlapping effects of the Fourier and Laplace Transforms in the frequency or s-domain. Without explicit knowledge of when and how each transform was applied, it is challenging to reconstruct the sequence accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
