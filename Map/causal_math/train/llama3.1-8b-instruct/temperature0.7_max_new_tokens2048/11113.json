  "Problem": "Let's examine a thermal system where temperature \\( T \\) at any point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) is governed by the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\), with \\( k \\) as the thermal diffusivity constant. We study the impact of a sudden temperature change applied using a function \\( f(T) = T + h \\), where \\( h \\) is a constant heat increment.\n\nIf \\( f(T) \\) is applied to the initial temperature distribution \\( T_0(x) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), and then the system is allowed to evolve under the heat equation without further intervention, will \\( T(x,t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) be the same as if \\( T_0(x) \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under the heat equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\( f(T) \\) results in an initial temperature increment of \\( T_0(x) + h \\). The evolution of this new initial condition under the heat equation will differ from the original \\( T_0(x) \\) because the heat diffusion starts from a higher initial temperature, changing the temperature distribution at each point and time subsequently.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
