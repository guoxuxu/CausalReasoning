  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system where a matrix \\( M \\) is applied to vector \\( x \\) creating \\( y = Mx \\). An integral operation \\( I(f(x)) = \\int_0^T f(x(t)) dt \\) is performed to analyze the transformed vector \\( y \\) over a period \\( T \\), where \\( f(x(t)) \\) is a function dependent on vector \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven the output from \\( I(f(x)) \\) at \\( t = T \\), can we determine the initial vector \\( x_0 \\) without knowing \\( M \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linking of \\( x_0 \\) to \\( y(T) \\) is through \\( M \\), and without knowing \\( M \\), the components and structure that led to \\( y(T) \\) through \\( I(f(x)) \\) can't be traced accurately.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
