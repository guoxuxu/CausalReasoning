  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), evolving over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. The transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) with another constant matrix \\\\( Q \\\\) is applied to assess various impacts on the function.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we ascertain precisely what interventions were performed (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), merely by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Similar endpoints \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from varying sequences or combinations of the transformations \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Rt} \\\\). The possible confounding in trajectories due to the interplay of multiple matrices and their exponentials results in ambiguities, rendering it impossible to decode the exact nature or sequence of interventions based on final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
