  "Problem": "Analyze the causal relationship in a model where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), representing periodic motion in the complex plane, modifies a dynamical system described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Dx \\\\), with D being a diagonalizable matrix. Consider the effects of transforming the state by applying the function \\\\( h(z, x) = z(t) \\\\cdot x \\\\) at an initial time 't'.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( x(T) \\\\) resulting from the system with an unknown initial application of \\\\( h(z, x) \\\\), can we determine the exact initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) only from the knowledge of \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the phase shift introduced by \\\\( h(z, x) \\\\) at the beginning and the lack of information about the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or the exact complex function applied, the original state \\\\( x_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely deduced from the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) alone, due to the non-reversibility of complex multiplicative transformations over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "initial vector x_0 → state x(T); state x(T) → system dynamics D; system dynamics D → state x(T); function h(z, x) → state x(T); function z(t) → state x(T); initial time t → function z(t); function z(t) → state x(T); function h(z, x) → initial vector x_0"
