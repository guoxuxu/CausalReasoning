  "Problem": "Consider a closed loop feedback system where the output function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\\\) involving a Laplace transform variable 's'. We evaluate the introduction of a disturbance function \\\\( d(t) = e^{\\\\lambda t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a real number, affecting the output.\n\nGiven the system output at time \\\\( T \\\\), can we determine exactly the real parameters \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) or the precise nature of their application (either the disturbance or the control), using only the output observed?",
  "Explanation": "The complexity arising from the convolutions and the layers of transformations applied to the system (both the disturbance and the control) makes it infeasible to precisely distinguish or reverse engineer the values of \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) or to identify their modes of application solely based on the final output. The combined effect and dependency on the initial state and interventions complicate such determinations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
