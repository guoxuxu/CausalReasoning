  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions representing the real and imaginary parts of \\\\(z\\\\), respectively. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) is determined by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Sz\\\\), where S is a constant complex number. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{Kt}z\\\\) where K is another constant complex number.\n\nIf \\\\(f(z)\\\\) is applied to a complex value \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Sz\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(z(t)\\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\(z_0\\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Sz\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial transformation by \\\\(f(z)\\\\) modifies the starting point of the evolution, and because \\\\(e^{Kt}\\\\) can change the growth rates and directions (both the amplitude and the phase) of the real and imaginary components of \\\\(z\\\\), the trajectory and final state at time T will differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
