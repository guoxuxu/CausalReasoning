  "Problem": "Consider the time evolution of a quantum state in the presence of a magnetic field. Let the system be described by the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{d\\\\psi}{dt} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where H is the Hamiltonian of the system affected by the magnetic field B, given as \\\\( H = -\\\\gamma \\\\vec{B} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{S} \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) being the gyromagnetic ratio and \\\\( \\\\vec{S} \\\\) the spin operator. The transformation \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{-i\\\\theta S_z} \\\\psi \\\\) represents a rotation around the z-axis by an angle \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\), \\\\( g(\\\\psi) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since both \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) and \\\\( g(\\\\psi) \\\\) are unitary transformations corresponding to rotations, they can create similar or indistinguishably altered quantum states depending on the angles \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) and their timing relative to the evolution under H. Without specific knowledge of these angles and their application times, determining the type and sequence of interventions from \\\\( \\\\psi(T) \\\\) alone is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
