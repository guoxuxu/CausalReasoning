  "Problem": "Consider a function system described by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\\\), where A is a complex constant. This system undergoes an integral transformation defined by \\\\( I(w) = \\\\int w(z) dz \\\\) applied over a certain path in the complex plane.\n\nIf an additional operation \\\\( w(z) = e^{Bz}w(z) \\\\) (where \\\\( B \\\\) is a new complex constant) is applied mid-way through the integration process, will the result of \\\\( I(w) \\\\) still only depend on \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding the operation \\\\( e^{Bz}w(z) \\\\) modifies the expression for the function being integrated, introducing dependence on both \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\). The final result of \\\\( I(w) \\\\) would now incorporate effects from both constants, significantly influencing the trajectory and outcome of the integral transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
