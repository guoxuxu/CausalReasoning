  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the complex differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + kz^2 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. This system is influenced by applying a linear transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( S(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the non-linear nature of the differential equation and the potential for significant alteration by the linear transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\), multiple combinations of parameters and interventions might lead to the same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). This makes it impossible to uniquely identify which interventions were applied simply from the endpoint.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
