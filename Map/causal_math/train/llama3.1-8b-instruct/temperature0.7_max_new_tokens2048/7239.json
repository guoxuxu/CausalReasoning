  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by complex function \\(\\Omega(z) = \\frac{1}{LCz^2 + RCz + 1}\\), where \\(L\\), \\(C\\), and \\(R\\) are inductance, capacitance, and resistance respectively. The response of the circuit is analyzed under the input transformation given by Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a feedback intervention through another transfer function \\( G(s) \\) is applied, will the new output \\( Y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) only depend on \\( \\Omega(s) \\) and not on \\( F(s) \\) or \\( G(s) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The additional feedback intervention \\( G(s) \\) modifies the system response again, making the final output dependent on the cumulative effect of \\( \\Omega(s) \\), \\( F(s) \\), and \\( G(s) \\). This interaction affects how the input signal is processed through these transfer functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
