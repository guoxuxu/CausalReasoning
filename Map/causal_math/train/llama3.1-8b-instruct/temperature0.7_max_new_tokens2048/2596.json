  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\), where \\\\(w(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\) over a variable t, with z as a complex variable. The function \\\\(f(t)\\\\) is transformed via another function \\\\(g(t) = t^2 f(t)\\\\). Analyze the impact of transforming \\\\(f(t)\\\\) to \\\\(g(t)\\\\) on the complex function \\\\(w(z)\\\\).\n\nCan the application of either \\\\(g(t) = t^2 f(t)\\\\) or \\\\(h(t) = t f(t)\\\\) or both be uniquely identified by observing the structure of \\\\(w(z)\\\\) in the modified integral \\\\(\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} t^3 e^{zt}f(t) dt\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting integral expression does indicate the presence of both \\\\(t^2\\\\) and \\\\(t\\\\) factors, suggesting the application of both functions. However, without explicit tracking of the transformations or additional markers indicating each intervention's individual effects, you cannot definitively conclude about the sequence or the discrete use of \\\\(g(t)\\\\) and \\\\(h(t)\\\\) just from the final form of the expression.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
