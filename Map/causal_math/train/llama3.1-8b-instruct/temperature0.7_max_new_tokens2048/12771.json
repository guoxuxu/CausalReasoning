  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) and s is a complex parameter. We explore the causal inference between varying the parameter s and its effect on the transformed function F(s).\n\nGiven an observed change in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) without knowing the corresponding value changes in s or t, can we determine whether s was altered, or \\\\( f(t) \\\\) was intervened upon?",
  "Explanation": "The change in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) can result both from a change in s affecting the exponential decay rate or a direct intervention in \\\\( f(t) \\\\), scaling the function. Without additional information about the nature of the parameter alterations or the form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\), the specific cause of change in \\\\( F(s) \\\\) remains indeterminable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
