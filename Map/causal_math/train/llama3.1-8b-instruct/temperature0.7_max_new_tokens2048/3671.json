  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\) are constants. Analyzing the system under the Laplace transformation \\\\( L \\\\), defined as \\\\( L\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable.\n\nIf an intervention changes the differential equation to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\\\omega z + g(t) \\\\), where \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is another function, will the transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{k}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\) remain valid?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) alters the system dynamics, and thus the Laplace transform of the system becomes \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{L\\{g(t)\\}}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\), which will generally differ from \\\\( \\\\frac{k}{s+i\\\\omega} \\\\) unless \\\\( g(t) \\\\) corresponds uniquely to a constant \\\\( k \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
