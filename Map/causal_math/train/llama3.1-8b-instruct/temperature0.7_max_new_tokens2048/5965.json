  "Problem": "Consider a complex differential system described by the Laplace transform equation \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is defined in the complex domain. Let's analyze an intervention using an inverse mapping \\\\( g(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[H(s)] \\\\) where \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is another complex function.\n\nIf the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is transformed using its Laplace transform to \\\\( F(s) \\\\) at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), followed by natural evolution without further transformation, will the inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[F(s)] \\\\) at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) give back exactly \\\\( f(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Laplace transform and its inverse is theoretically exact under ideal conditions, meaning that if no external intervention is applied, \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}[F(s)] \\\\) at any time T will precisely recover the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
