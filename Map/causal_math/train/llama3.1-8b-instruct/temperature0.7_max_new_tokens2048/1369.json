  "Problem": "Let \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\\\) be a transfer function of a linear time-invariant system, where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants. Suppose an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is transformed into the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) through this system. We examine the effect of input transformations using a Laplace transform \\\\( L(x(t)) = X(s) \\\\) and its inverse on the resulting output.\n\nIf an input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) changes to \\\\( x'(t) = x(t)e^{ct} \\\\) where \\\\(c\\\\) is a constant, and the system processes \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be the same as if the original \\\\( x(t) \\\\) was processed?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( x'(t) = x(t)e^{ct} \\\\) alters the Laplace transform of the input to \\\\( X'(s) = X(s-c) \\\\). The output therefore becomes \\\\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s-c) \\\\) instead of \\\\( H(s)X(s) \\\\). The modification in the frequency domain due to the shift \\\\( s-c \\\\) fundamentally changes the resulting time-domain output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
