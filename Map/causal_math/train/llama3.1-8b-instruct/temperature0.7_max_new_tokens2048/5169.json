  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We analyse the effect of the integral transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt}z \\\\, dt \\\\), where N is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be equivalent to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was purely evolved to T under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) changes the trajectory by integrating the transformed state over time, which alters the initial conditions and consequently the evolution pathway under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\). The matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Nt} \\\\) affects the initial state's scaling and potential rotation, which isn't corrected or reversed simply through natural evolution under M.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
