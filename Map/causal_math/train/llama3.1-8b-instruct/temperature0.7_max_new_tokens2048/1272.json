  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) defined as the solution to the complex differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz + k\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is a complex constant. We are investigating scenarios where an integral transformation \\\\(w(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} z(s) ds\\\\) is applied, with \\\\(A\\\\) being a constant matrix.\n\nCan we determine exactly what transformations and interventions were applied, based only on the value of \\\\(w(T)\\\\) and the knowledge of the differential equation governing \\\\(z(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the potential non-commutativity of the matrices \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\), and their distinct influences on the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\), it's challenging to ascertain precisely which transformations and interventions took place from merely the endpoint \\\\(w(T)\\\\). Different combinations of \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) can lead to overlapping or indistinguishable outcomes, complicating the reverse deduction of interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
