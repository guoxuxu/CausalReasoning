  "Problem": "Investigate a signal processing model driven by a linear time-invariant system with impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\) governed by its Laplace Transform \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant. The impact of a Fourier transform modulation \\\\( m(t) = e^{i\\\\omega_0 t} \\\\) on the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is analyzed.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of an additional filtering process characterized by \\\\( G(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+b} \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant, is introduced at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend exclusively on the original system characteristics \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and not on the modulation \\\\( m(t) \\\\) or the intervention filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention filter \\\\( G(s) \\\\) alters the system's characteristics by introducing an additional dynamic. The final output \\\\( y(T) \\\\) is influenced by both the initial system's response, the modulation effect, and the characteristics of the intervention filter, reflecting the compositional interaction between these elements.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
