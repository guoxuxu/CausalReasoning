  "Problem": "Consider a control system governed by the matrix differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Mx + u\\), where \\(M\\) is a constant matrix and \\(u\\) is a control input. We examine the influence of applying a transformation \\( h(x) = e^{Nt}x \\), with \\(N\\) being another constant matrix, on the system’s trajectory.\n\nCan we precisely identify what transformations or control inputs were applied (whether \\( h(x) \\), \\( u \\), or both), based solely on observing \\( x(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\( x(T) \\), multiple potential interventions and transformations (from \\( N \\) and \\( K \\)) could result in the same endpoint due to their overlaps in state space alterations and due to the linear combination possibilities within the control system. It’s impossible to distinguish between these influences without further system-specific information or initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
