  "Problem": "Consider a stochastic process \\\\( X(t) \\\\) modeled by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{X} = AX + BU \\\\) where A and B are constant matrices and U is a control input. We study the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(X) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-Cs}X(s) ds \\\\), with C being a constant matrix, on the behavior of the process.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial state \\\\( X(0) \\\\) and control input U solely from observing the output of \\\\( T(X) \\\\) at time T without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The process involves an integral transformation that blends the effects of X over a period from 0 to T. Given the involvement of matrices A, B, and C, and without explicit knowledge of U throughout the period, reversing the transformation to deduce \\\\( X(0) \\\\) and U uniquely is not feasible, as multiple different states and inputs could lead to the same transformed output.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
