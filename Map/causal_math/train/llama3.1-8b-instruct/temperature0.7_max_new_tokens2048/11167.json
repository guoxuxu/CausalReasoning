  "Problem": "We consider a system operating under the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(f(t)) = F(s) \\\\) and its inverse. The original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) models a physical phenomenon (e.g., heat distribution over time), and we explore scenarios where transformations and interventions occur, such as multiplying by a function \\\\( g(t) \\\\).\n\nIf we intervene by applying a different transformation, \\\\( h(t) = e^{-t} \\\\) at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting the evolving function, will the final Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) \\\\) solely depend on the initial \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and not on the transformations \\\\( g(t) \\\\) or \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) introduces another alteration that significantly affects the final state in the s-domain. The interplay between the initial and intervening transformations results in a final transform that depends on all applied functions (initial and intervening), making it not only dependent on \\\\( f(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
