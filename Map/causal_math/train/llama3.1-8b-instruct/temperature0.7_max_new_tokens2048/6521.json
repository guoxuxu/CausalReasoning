  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex number. We analyze this function's impact when applied as a transformation within an integral, specifically for the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to the integral \\\\( I = \\\\int_0^T e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\) without further modification, will the resultant integral \\\\( \\\\int_0^T e^{a e^z} \\\\, dz \\\\) bear the same value as the original without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) changes the integrand significantly due to the properties of the exponential function in the complex plane, especially as \\\\( e^{ e^z } \\\\) grows much faster than \\\\( e^{z} \\\\), leading to a fundamentally different result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
