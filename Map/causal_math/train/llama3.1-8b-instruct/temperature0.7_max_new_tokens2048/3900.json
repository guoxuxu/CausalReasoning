  "Problem": "Consider the linear algebra system where vector transformation through matrices plays a key role. Let \\\\(z(t)\\\\) be the state of a system at any time t, evolving according to the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N(t)\\\\), where M is a constant matrix and \\\\(N(t)\\\\) is a time-dependent  force vector. Let there be an operation \\\\(h(z) = S t z\\\\), with S being a non-commutative constant matrix applied at a specified time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), is it possible to determine accurately which transformations (whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(j(z)\\\\), or both) were applied, based solely on the value of \\\\(z(T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-commutative properties of matrices S and Q with M, and the possibility of multiple combinations leading to the same final state, it is not possible to uniquely backtrack and identify which operations were applied. Multiple sets of operations could lead to the same endpoint, creating inherent ambiguities in causal inference from effect back to cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "M → dz/dt; N(t) → dz/dt; h(z) → z; j(z) → z; M → z; N(t) → z; h(z) → z(T); j(z) → z(T)"
