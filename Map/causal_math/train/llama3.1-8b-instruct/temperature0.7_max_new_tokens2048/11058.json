  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the function \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{At}s \\, ds \\\\), where A is a complex number. To analyze the behavior, an intervention by a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) where B is also a complex number, is considered over time t.\n\nAfter observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can one definitively conclude what the value of A was, without knowing if transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) was applied, deducing A from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone is ambiguous since B could have significantly altered the state, changing how \\\\( z(T) \\\\) originated from \\\\( A \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
