  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution across an object is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where \\\\( u \\\\) is the temperature, \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity, and \\\\( \\\\nabla^2 \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. We investigate the effects of applying a thermal source function described by \\\\( f(u) = \\\\alpha e^{-\\\\beta t} u \\\\) on the temperature distribution over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants.\n\nGiven the endpoint temperature distribution \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( u(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( u(T) \\\\) can arise from multiple potential sequences or types of interventions. The impact of exponential decays influenced by multiple parameters creates ambiguity in reconstructing the exact sequence or type of thermal interventions applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
