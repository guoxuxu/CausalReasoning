  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. This function is then transformed using a Fourier Transform to analyze its frequency components over time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified by a scaling factor \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) at time \\\\( t_0 \\\\) resulting in \\\\( z(t) = \\alpha e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), does its Fourier Transform still indicate the original frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) without ambiguity?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling the function by \\\\( \\alpha \\\\) does not alter the frequency content; it only changes the amplitude of the Fourier Transform. The frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) remains clearly indicated by the position of the delta peak, thus the effect still reliably reveals the original cause even after intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
