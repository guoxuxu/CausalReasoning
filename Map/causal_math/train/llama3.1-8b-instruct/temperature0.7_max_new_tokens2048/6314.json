  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + i\\\\omega u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We investigate the effects of an integral transform, specifically the Fourier Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), defined by \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega x} u(x,t) \\\\, dx \\\\).\n\nFrom observing \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\), can we determine the exact initial function \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) \\\\) without knowing the specific dynamics and transformations that have occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Given the linear and time-invariant nature of the Fourier Transform coupled with the specific form of the partial differential equation, \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\) directly provides sufficient information to uniquely calculate \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) \\\\) by using the inverse of the recorded dynamics, \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, 0) = e^{\\\\omega T} \\\\hat{u}(\\\\omega, T) \\\\).",
