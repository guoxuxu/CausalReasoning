  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function's behavior when subjected to Laplace Transform. Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), and its transformation into the Laplace domain, defined by \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). Analyze the implications of altering the parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and its effects on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\).\n\nIf the frequency parameter \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is increased, without any direct intervention in the Laplace domain, will the behavior of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) change correspondingly in terms of its pole locations?",
  "Explanation": "Altering \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the time domain directly impacts the pole locations in the Laplace transform domain. An increase in \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) results in a horizontal shift of the pole, affecting the system's frequency response characteristics due to the relationship \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
