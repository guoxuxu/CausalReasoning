  "Problem": "Consider the analytical solution of the heat equation \\\\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\\\) under initial conditions that can be represented as a Fourier transform. An operation \\\\( f(u) = u + e^{i\\\\omega_0 x} \\\\) is introduced, where \\\\( \\\\omega_0 \\\\) is a constant frequency.\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both) based only on knowing \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The solution to the heat equation presents additive linearity and diffusive effects, smoothing out distinct features over time. Multiple different combinations of initial conditions and interventions can lead to similar or identical temperature profiles at time T, especially when they involve sinusoidal components that could interfere or blend in a non-distinguishable manner due to the inherent properties of the heat equation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
