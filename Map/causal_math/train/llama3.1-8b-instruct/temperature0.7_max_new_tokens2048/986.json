  "Problem": "We consider a scenario involving the Laplace transform of a function, which is integrally related to solving differential equations. The function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( x'(t) = Kx(t) \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( x(0) = x_0 \\\\), and the Laplace transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) is defined as \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{x(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}x(t)dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( X(s) \\\\) after using \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on \\\\( x(t) \\\\), can we correctly infer the initial condition \\\\( x_0 \\\\) from \\\\( X(s) \\\\) without further information?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( X(s) \\\\) of the solution \\\\( x(t) \\\\) for \\\\( x'(t) = Kx(t) \\\\) carries complete information about the initial condition, given by \\\\( X(s) = \\\\frac{x_0}{s-K} \\\\) under typical conditions where \\\\( s > |K| \\\\). This formula allows for exact retrieval of \\\\( x_0 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
