  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are governed by the system of linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cy + Du \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constant matrices and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( Tz(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}z(s) ds \\\\) is analyzed over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we determine the original state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( Tz(t) \\\\), the integration and exponential factors involved could have significantly altered the trajectory from the initial state. The system's dependence on past states integrated over time complicates backtracking to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
