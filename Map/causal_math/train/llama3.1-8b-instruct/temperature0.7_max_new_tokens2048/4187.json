  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output state z depends on the input state x through the transformation given by z = Sx, where S is a complex transformation matrix. We consider the influence of multiplying complex eigenvalues in the matrix S analyzed over variable changes.\n\nIf an intervention occurs by adding an additional constant matrix K to S after the eigenvalue multiplication by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\), will the system's output z only be influenced by the modified matrix \\\\( \\\\lambda S \\\\) and not by the intervention K?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of matrix K as an intervention after scaling S by \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) changes both the nature and result of the linear transformation, directly affecting the output z. Thus, both \\\\( \\\\lambda S \\\\) and K influence the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
