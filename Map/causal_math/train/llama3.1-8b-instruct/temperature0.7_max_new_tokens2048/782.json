  "Problem": "Consider a function \\u03c6(z) defined over complex numbers, where \\u03c6(z) is holomorphic and satisfies the equation \\u03c6'(z) = \\u03c6(z) + 2z. A linear operator L that acts on \\u03c6 is given by L[\\u03c6](z) = z*\\u03c6(z). Investigating the impact of this operator on \\u03c6 helps understand its transformation properties under complex function operations.\n\nGiven the function \\u03c6(z) at z = \\u03b1, can we confirm if L was earlier applied at z = 0 without any extra information?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the prior application of L just by observing the function at z = \\u03b1 is challenging without additional information. The changes induced by L at z = 0 could be compensated or altered unpredictably by the behavior of the derivative \\u03c6'(z) during its evolution to z = \\u03b1.",
