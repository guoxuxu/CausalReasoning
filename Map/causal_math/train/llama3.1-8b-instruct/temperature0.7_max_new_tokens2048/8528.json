  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Az(t) \\\\), where A is a complex constant. Investigate the influence of the transformation defined by the mapping \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, over time t.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we deterministically ascertain what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), solely from knowing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various sequences or combinations of interventions due to the properties of exponential transformations with complex exponents. Multiple intervention scenarios could lead to the same endpoint due to the overlapping effects and the complex nature of A, B, and C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
