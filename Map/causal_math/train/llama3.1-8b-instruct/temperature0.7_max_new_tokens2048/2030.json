  "Problem": "Let's consider a mathematical model where a wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) satisfies the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\\\(V(x)\\\\) and examine the impact of applying a Fourier transform on \\\\(\\\\psi(x, t)\\\\) resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(k, t)\\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed wave function \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(k, T)\\\\) at time T, can it be asserted that the initial wave function \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) evolved to time T without any external manipulation or transformation?",
  "Explanation": "If the evolution dynamics (i.e., potential function \\\\(V(x)\\\\)) are known and no alteration was implied further than existing within the Schrödinger equation, then it is certain that \\\\(\\\\hat{\\\\psi}(k, T)\\\\) derives naturally from \\\\(\\\\psi(x, 0)\\\\) through the standard time evolution, and no external manipulation other than the Fourier transforms are involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
