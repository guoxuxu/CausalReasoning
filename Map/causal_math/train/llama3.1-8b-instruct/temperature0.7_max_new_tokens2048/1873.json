  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Pu\\\\), where \\\\(P\\\\) is a differential operator. Investigate how the introduction of a boundary condition using the function \\\\(h(u) = e^{Qt}u\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), where \\\\(Q\\\\) is another differential operator, affects the system.\n\nIf \\\\(h(u)\\\\) is applied to the initial function \\\\(u_0\\\\) and then the system evolves under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Pu\\\\) without further intervention, will the state \\\\(u(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = T\\\\) be equivalent to the state if \\\\(u_0\\\\) were evolved directly under \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Pu\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the \\\\(h(u)\\\\) boundary condition modifies the initial state by redefining \\\\(u(0)\\\\) as \\\\(e^{Qt}u_0\\\\). Since \\\\(e^{Qt}\\\\) affects the initial condition, the evolution of \\\\(u(t)\\\\) under \\\\(P\\\\) will follow a different path compared to starting from \\\\(u_0\\\\) without modification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
