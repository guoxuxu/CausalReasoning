  "Problem": "Consider a complex integration scenario described by a contour integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\) around a closed path C in the complex plane, where \\\\(f(z) = \\\\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1}\\\\) and \\\\(a\\\\) is a real constant. The Laplace transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}\\\\) is used to analyze the integral in terms of real time dynamics.\n\nCan we precisely identify the interventions applied to the contour path or the parameter \\\\(a\\\\) solely from observing the computed integral \\\\(\\\\int_C f(z)\\\\, dz\\\\) at a later stage?",
  "Explanation": "The final integral value could result from numerous combinations of changes in the parameter \\\\(a\\\\) and modifications to the path or other characteristics of the system. The lack of uniqueness in solutions to complex integrals under transformation influences prevents a precise determination of the interventions, noting potential overlaps and interactions in effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
