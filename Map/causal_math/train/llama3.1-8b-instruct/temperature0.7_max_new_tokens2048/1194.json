  "Problem": "Consider the transform \\\\( z = f(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\), which maps the input x to a complex domain. We analyze how the function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) impacts the causality and the influence of various interventions represented by other transforms such as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^x \\\\sin(t) dt \\\\).\n\nAfter observing \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at \\\\( x = T \\\\), can we deduce the original input value \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing the specifics of the function applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation introduces an opacity in reversing the effect to the cause. Due to the exponential increase incorporated by \\\\( e^{x^2} \\\\), multiple values of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) can lead to the same outcome at \\\\( x = T \\\\), hence making it infeasible to uniquely determine \\\\( x_0 \\\\) merely through the observation of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at \\\\( x = T \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
