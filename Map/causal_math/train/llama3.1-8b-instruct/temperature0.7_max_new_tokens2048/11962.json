  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear transformation \\\\( x(t) = Sx \\\\) where S is a constant matrix. The impact of the complex function \\\\( h(x) = e^{iDt}x \\\\) over time t, with D also being a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( k(x) = e^{Ft}x \\\\) (where F is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on S and not on D or F?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( k(x) \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) additionally affects the trajectory initiated by \\\\( h(x) \\\\). The final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) becomes dependent on the effects of both D and F, as well as S. The end state reflects compositional influences from all the applied transformations, creating a complex dependency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
