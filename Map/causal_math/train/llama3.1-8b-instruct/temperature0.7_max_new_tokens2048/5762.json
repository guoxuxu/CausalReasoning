  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant. We investigate the effect of the inverse transformation given by multiplying the transform by \\\\( s^2 \\\\) and then applying the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nKnowing the function \\\\( g(t) = t^2f(t) \\\\), can we uniquely recover the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without any initial values?",
  "Explanation": "Given \\\\( g(t) = t^2f(t) \\\\), it is possible to algebraically manipulate and apply inverse operations to recover \\\\( f(t) \\\\). Since the modification applied was explicit and invertible, recovering \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\) from its modified state is feasible through differentiation and adjustment by factors of \\\\( t \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
