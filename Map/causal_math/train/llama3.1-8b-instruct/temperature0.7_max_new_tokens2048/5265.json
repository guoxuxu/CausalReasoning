  "Problem": "Analyze a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\partial_t u(x,t) = L u(x,t) \\\\), where L is a differential operator. Consider how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\\\int e^{-ikx} u(x,t) dx \\\\) affects the system's behavior.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,0) \\\\) of the initial condition \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is taken, and then the system is evolved according to \\\\( \\\\partial_t u(x,t) = L u(x,t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T before transforming?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and then evolving the system only alters the domain in which the solution is calculated. The linearity and time-invariant properties of both the operator L and the Fourier transform ensure that \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\) corresponds directly to the Fourier transform of the solution had it been evolved in the spatial domain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
