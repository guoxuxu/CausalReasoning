  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) acting on a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) defined by an integral transform \\\\( L[u(x)] = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(x, s) u(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(x, s) \\\\) is the kernel of the transformation. Suppose we introduce a perturbation function \\\\( p(x) \\\\) which modifies \\\\( u(x) \\\\) to \\\\( v(x) = u(x) + p(x) \\\\).\n\nIf an additional modification \\\\( q(x) \\\\) is applied after time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), modifying \\\\( u(x) \\\\) to \\\\( w(x) = v(x) + q(x) \\\\), will the transformed outcome \\\\( L[w(x)] \\\\) still reflect the actions of both \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\), or just depend on \\\\( L[u(x)] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The linearity of \\\\( L \\\\) implies that \\\\( L[w(x)] = L[u(x)] + L[p(x)] + L[q(x)] \\\\). Thus, both the actions of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( q(x) \\\\) are reflected in the final transformation, adding to the output from \\\\( L[u(x)] \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
