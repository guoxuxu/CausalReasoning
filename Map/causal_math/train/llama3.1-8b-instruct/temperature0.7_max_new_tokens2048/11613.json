  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit modeled by a system of linear differential equations. Let \\\\(V(t)\\\\) be the voltage at a given node, represented by the linear relationship \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = MV + NU \\\\), where \\\\(M\\\\) and \\\\(N\\\\) are constant matrices and \\\\(U(t)\\\\) represents external inputs like currents. Analyze the effects of applying an integral transformation, specifically the Laplace Transform, to the inputs.\n\nIf the Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{U(t)\\\\} \\\\) is applied to the inputs, and the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{V} = MV + NU \\\\) without further intervention, will the behavior of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) for large t depend solely on the transformed inputs?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace Transform of the input directly determines the solution form for \\\\( V(t) \\\\) in the s-domain, and by inverse transformation, influences the entire time-domain behavior of the voltage, assuming no additional disturbances or changes to the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
