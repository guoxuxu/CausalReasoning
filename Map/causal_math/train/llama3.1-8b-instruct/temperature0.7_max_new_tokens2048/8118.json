  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing the motion of a particle in a plane, influenced by the complex transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant real number.\n\nCan we determine the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied, the original point \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined because the rotation could have placed multiple potential initial points to the same endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
