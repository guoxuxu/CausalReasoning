  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) representing a control function. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, where A is also a constant matrix.\n\nCan the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) be uniquely determined from \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T, assuming no knowledge of the control function \\\\( u \\\\) applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the control function \\\\( u \\\\) and only observing \\\\( T(z) \\\\), it is impractical to reverse engineer the exact initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) due to the contributions of both M and N over time compounded by the transformation \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), which obscures the effects of \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
