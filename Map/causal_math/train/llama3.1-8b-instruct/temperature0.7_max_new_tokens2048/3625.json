  "Problem": "Consider a complex analytic function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) tracing a path in the complex plane. We analyze the impact of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant, at different time intervals.\n\nIf \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under its natural dynamic without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T without applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial complex number by a rotation in the complex plane, which changes the trajectory of the function. As \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is a rotation, the initial condition is altered, thus leading to a different position in the complex plane at any later time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
