  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and let the transformation be defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\theta t} z(t) \\, dt \\\\), with \\\\( \\theta \\\\) being another real constant.\n\nFrom the output of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original value of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) in \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\\\( \\omega \\\\), as different values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\theta \\\\) could potentially yield similar results in the integral, especially without knowing the specific phase relationships and integration bounds.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
