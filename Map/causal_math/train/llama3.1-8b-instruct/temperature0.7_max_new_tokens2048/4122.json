  "Problem": "Consider a setup where a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time in accordance to two linear systems \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Qy \\\\), with P and Q being constant matrices. The impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\), where R is another constant matrix, is examined.\n\nOn observing \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we unequivocally deduce the initial complex vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), which scales the complex vector, it's impossible to uniquely determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) if the matrix R does not commute with P and Q, or if the scaling completely masked or altered the inherent dynamics of the systems.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
