  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) passed through an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) described by the kernel \\\\( K(t, s) = e^{-(t-s)^2} \\\\), such that the transformed function is \\\\( Tz(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(t, s) z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\nIs it possible to accurately identify the specific sequence and nature of interventions (original frequency or shifted frequency) from the transformed output function \\\\( Tz(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the integral transformation's smoothing effect and the overlap of effects from different frequencies induced by potential interventions, it is challenging to uniquely reverse-engineer and determine whether original or shifted frequencies, or both, were present in the input function merely by examining \\\\( Tz(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
