  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{At}x(s) ds\\\\), where A is a constant matrix, and x(t) is a variable dependent on t. We explore the change in z(t) due to the Laplace transform \\\\( X(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(x(t))(s) \\\\) and its inverse.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\frac{X(s)}{s-B} \\\\) is applied on \\\\( X(s) \\\\) and then both are inverted back to their time-domain representations, will the effect on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be solely dependent on A and not B?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention by applying the second transformation adds another dimension of change to the original function, thereby influencing the resultant curve not only by A but also by the effects introduced due to the matrix B in the Laplace domain. Thus, the final outcome at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is dependent on both A and B.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
