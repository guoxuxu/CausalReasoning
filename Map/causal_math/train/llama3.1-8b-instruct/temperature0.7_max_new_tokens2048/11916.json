  "Problem": "In a physics experiment, a wave function \\\\( \\\\psi(x, t) \\\\) is modeled using the Schrödinger equation \\\\( i\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = H\\\\psi \\\\), where \\\\( H \\\\) is a Hamiltonian operator. We run simulations using an initial condition \\\\( \\\\psi_0(x) \\\\) modified by a function \\\\( f(\\\\psi) = e^{iKx}\\\\psi \\\\), with \\\\( K \\\\) representing a constant wave number.\n\nIf \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve according to the Schrödinger equation without further intervention, will \\\\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( \\\\psi_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to time T under the Schrödinger equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(\\\\psi) \\\\) initially modifies the wave function by introducing a phase shift depending on \\\\( x \\\\). This initial condition change results in a different wave function evolution under the Schrödinger equation, altering the outcome at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
