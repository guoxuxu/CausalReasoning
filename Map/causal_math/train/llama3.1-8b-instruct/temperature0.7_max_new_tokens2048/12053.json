  "Problem": "Assume a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\(u_t + Au_x = 0\\\\), where A is a constant matrix. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the operator \\\\(T(u) = e^{-Bx}u\\\\) across the spatial domain x, where B is another constant matrix.\n\nAfter observing the function \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\) at time T, can we deduce the initial function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) without knowing whether the operator \\\\(T(u)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of the application of \\\\(T(u)\\\\), it's impossible to infer accurately the initial function \\\\(u_0(x)\\\\) because the transformation \\\\(e^{-Bx}\\\\) could have changed the original state in such a way that multiple initial conditions could lead to the same observed state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
