  "Problem": "Consider a feedback loop circuit implementing a Laplace Transform. Let \\\\( u(t) \\\\) be the input and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) be the output, subject to the transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\). The impact of an external signal modification by a complex function \\\\( f(u) = u e^{st} \\\\), where s is a complex number, is analyzed.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately back-calculate to obtain the original input \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( f(u) \\\\), any attempted back-calculation would assume a standard transfer without the frequency shift introduced by \\\\( e^{st} \\\\). This would result in an incorrect representation of the original input, as the additional exponential term fundamentally alters the Laplace domain representation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
