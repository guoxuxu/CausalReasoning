  "Problem": "Consider the operation of complex integration along a contour in the complex plane defined by \\\\\n\nDoes introducing a pole inside the contour \\\\( \\\\gamma \\\\) without any other change affect the value of the integral \\\\( \\\\int_{\\\\gamma} f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a pole inside the contour affects the value of the integral due to the residue theorem. The residues at poles inside the contour contribute to the integral, altering the result from what it would be without the pole.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Pole inside contour → Change in contour topology; Change in contour topology → Change in integral value; Change in integral value → Change in f(z); f(z) → Integral value"
