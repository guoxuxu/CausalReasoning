  "Problem": "Consider the functional equation \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{(t-s)A}B u(s) \\\\, ds\\\\) describing a control system where A and B are constant matrices, and u(t) is a control function. Explore the impacts of applying a linear operator transformation \\\\(T(z) = Cz(t)\\\\), where C is a constant matrix, on this system.\n\nIf the transformation T(z) is applied to the output z(0) and the system evolves normally under the given functional equation without further intervention, will the output at time T be equivalent to the output obtained when T is not applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(T(z) = Cz(t)\\\\) modifies the initial output, which alters how the system responds to the control input over time. This leads to a transformed system state trajectory, hence resulting in a different output at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
