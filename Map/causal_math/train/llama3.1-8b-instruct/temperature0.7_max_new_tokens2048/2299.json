  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier Transform scenario where a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) is transformed into its Fourier counterpart \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and affected by a convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(x) = e^{-a x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( h(x) = e^{-bx^2} \\\\) is convoluted with \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at a specific point during the transformation process, will the final outcome exclusively depend on the initial function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and not on the sequence of convolution operations?",
  "Explanation": "The final outcome will depend on both the initial function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and the order and manner in which the convolutions with \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) are applied. The sequential application of convolution operations potentially results in different modification effects due to the associativity and distributive properties of convolution, altering the final result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
