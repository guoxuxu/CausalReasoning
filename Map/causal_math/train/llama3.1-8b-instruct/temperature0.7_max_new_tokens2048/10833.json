  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolving according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where \\\\( P \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), with \\\\( Q \\\\) being another constant matrix, on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\), thereby altering the evolution path of the system under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\). The effect of \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) at the initial time changes the trajectory, possibly resulting in a different \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
