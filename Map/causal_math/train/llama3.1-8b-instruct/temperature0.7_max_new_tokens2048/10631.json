  "Problem": "We are investigating the temperature dynamics in a material described by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\kappa \\\\Delta u \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator. Consider the effect of a thermal control method described by the function \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\alpha t}u \\\\) over time t, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new thermal control intervention \\\\( g(u) = e^{\\\\beta t}u \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another constant) is applied, does the final temperature distribution \\\\( u(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( u(T) \\\\) is influenced not only by thermal diffusivity \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) but also significantly by the exponential factors introduced by both \\\\( f(u) \\\\) and \\\\( g(u) \\\\). Each control intervention modifies the thermal dynamics separately, compounding their effects and making the outcome dependent on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
