  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system where the rate of growth of a population \\\\( p \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 \\\\), representing unrestricted quadratic growth. We consider alterations to this model through a transformation function \\\\( h(p) = p e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant decay factor.\n\nGiven the population at time \\\\( p(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( h(p) \\\\), \\\\( m(p) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( p(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( p(T) \\\\), determined by numerous factors and complex interactions between exponential transformations and quadratic growth, could similarly arise through different combinations or modes of applications of \\\\( h(p) \\\\) and \\\\( m(p) \\\\). The multiplicative nature of these transformations means different scenarios could yield the same final population, obscuring the specific interventions used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
