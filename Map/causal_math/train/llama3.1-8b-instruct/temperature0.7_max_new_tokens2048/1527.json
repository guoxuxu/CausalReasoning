  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature distribution over a plate is described by the heat equation \\\\( u_t = \\\\kappa \\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) being the thermal diffusivity constant. We explore the impact of an initial transformation using Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\\\xi) = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-2 \\\\pi i x \\\\cdot \\\\xi} u(x, 0) \\\\, dx \\\\) and study the system evolution.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by modifying the thermal diffusivity constant to \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\), will the resulting temperature distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the original diffusivity \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the thermal diffusivity partway through the process introduces a discontinuity in how heat diffuses through the plate. The subsequent temperature distribution relies on the combination of both \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) before and \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\) after the intervention, affecting the final outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
