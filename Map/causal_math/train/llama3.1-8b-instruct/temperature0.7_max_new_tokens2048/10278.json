  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{u} = Cu\\\\), where C is a linear operator. We further explore the role of an integral transformation \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ds}u(s) ds \\\\) where D is another linear operator.\n\nAfter observing the function at time T, \\\\( u(T) \\\\), can we determine the initial function \\\\( u_0 \\\\) before \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied, without any additional information about the operators?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) integrates the function \\\\( u \\\\) modified by \\\\( e^{Ds} \\\\), obscuring the original form of \\\\( u_0 \\\\). Without explicit knowledge of D or the functional form of \\\\( T(u) \\\\), the original \\\\( u_0 \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( u(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
