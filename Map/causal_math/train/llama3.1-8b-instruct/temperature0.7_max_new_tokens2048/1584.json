  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The system is subject to the operation \\\\( f(z) = z^2 \\\\) followed by an integral transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T} \\\\) defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nKnowing the output of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{T}[z](s) \\\\), can we determine whether modifications like \\\\( f(z) \\\\) or \\\\( g(z) \\\\) were applied, specifically their sequence or presence solely from this transformed result?",
  "Explanation": "Given the complexity added by operations such as squaring and exponential modifiers, and the fact that Laplace transform typically encodes information in a way that numerous distinct functions can yield similar transforms, distinguishing the exact operations or their order from the final transform result alone is not feasible. Overlaps in functional outcomes further complicate such deductions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
