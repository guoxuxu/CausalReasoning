  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) that solves the heat equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} - k\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} = 0\\\\) on an interval \\\\([0, L]\\\\) with boundary conditions \\\\(u(0,t) = 0\\\\) and \\\\(u(L, t) = 0\\\\). An external source \\\\(f(x)\\\\) is introduced, altering the initial condition to \\\\(u(x, 0) = f(x)\\\\).\n\nAssuming we know the system's state at time T and that some intervention occurred, can we exactly determine whether the state results from \\\\(f(x)\\\\), an intervention like \\\\(g(x, t)\\\\), or a combination of both?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact cause of the state at time T requires precise knowledge of both the time the interventions were applied and their specific forms. Due to the inherent nature of the heat equation to diffuse effects over time and the potential overlap in influence from \\\\(f(x)\\\\) and \\\\(g(x, t)\\\\), it is not possible to uniquely differentiate the source or determine their interactions precisely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
