  "Problem": "Consider a system with a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We investigate the behavior of this system when subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s}z(s) \\, ds \\\\).\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is set and the system evolves under its intrinsic dynamics until time t = T without any intervention, will the transformation \\\\( T[z](t) \\\\) at t = T still reflect the properties of the original system?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) integrates the effect of the exponential function on the system's trajectory over time, which modifies the outcome. The integral accumulates phase-influenced contributions from \\\\( z(s) \\\\), substantially altering the expected result compared to the direct evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
