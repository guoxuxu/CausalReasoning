  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}t^z \\\\, dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant and z is a complex variable. The integral is an example of a complex function involving a Mellin transform.\n\nIf the parameter s is modified at some point by an additive constant c (a new s becomes s+c), does this change the original integral's convergence behavior for \\\\( \\\\text{Re}(s) > 0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Changing s to s+c significantly alters the integral's convergence condition depending on the real part of c. If c shifts the real part of s to be less than or equal to zero, it could affect whether or not the integral converges.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
