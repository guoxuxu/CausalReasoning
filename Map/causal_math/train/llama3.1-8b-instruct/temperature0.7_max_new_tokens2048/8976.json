  "Problem": "Investigate a situation where the effectiveness of a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) is applied to a signal analyzed using the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) provides a method to convert the time-domain signal into the frequency-domain representation.\n\nCan we deduce precisely whether the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was applied, just by examining the post-intervention Fourier Transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\), assuming \\\\( v(t) \\\\) was certainly used?",
  "Explanation": "The application and the nature of the interventions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) can result in a frequency spectrum that may seem unaltered or significantly different, depending on the extent and accuracy of the counteracting intervention. Given that these manipulations affect the spectrum in intricate ways, identifying the use of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) solely based on the final spectrum is not feasible without additional details about the timing and alignment of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
