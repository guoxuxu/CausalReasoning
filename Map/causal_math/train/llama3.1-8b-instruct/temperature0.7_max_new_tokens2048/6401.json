  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is inductance, \\\\(R\\\\) is resistance, and \\\\(V(t)\\\\) is a time-varying voltage source. Analyze the effect of applying a linear time-invariant system transformation characterized by the impulse response function \\\\(h(t) = e^{-\\\\alpha t}\\\\) for \\\\(t \\\\geq 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\(h(t)\\\\) is applied to the voltage source \\\\(V(t)\\\\) at time \\\\(t = 0\\\\), and then the circuit is allowed to evolve under \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\(I(t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = T\\\\) be the same as if \\\\(V(t)\\\\) without transformation was directly applied under \\\\(L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\(h(t)\\\\) modifies the input voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) to a new function, changing how the current \\\\(I(t)\\\\) evolves over time. The transformation affects the entire dynamics of the circuit by altering the input, resulting in a different current at any time \\\\(T\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
