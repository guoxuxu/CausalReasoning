  "Problem": "Consider a system modeled by a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} = Ku\\\\) with a constant coefficient K. Analyze the influence of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( h(u) = Cu \\\\) where C is a constant matrix, applied to the initial condition.\n\nIf \\\\( h(u) \\\\) is applied to an initial vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\frac{du}{dt} = Ku\\\\) without further intervention, will the state vector \\\\( u(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to the state obtained by directly evolving \\\\( u_0 \\\\) to t = T under the same differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(u) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( Cu_0 \\\\). The solution to the differential equation with this new initial condition is \\\\( u(t) = e^{Kt}(Cu_0) \\\\), which generally differs from \\\\( e^{Kt}u_0 \\\\) unless C commutes with \\\\( e^{Kt} \\\\), affecting the state trajectory over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
