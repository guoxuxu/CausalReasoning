  "Problem": "Consider a functional transformation given by \\\\( z = F(x) \\\\) where \\\\( F \\\\) is an integral operator defined as \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\), and A is an exponent matrix. We are exploring the effect of a secondary operator \\\\( G(x) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} B(t)x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( B(t) \\\\) is another matrix function controlling the transformation's behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( G(x) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) initially, and no further interventions are made, will the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T be the same as directly using \\\\( F(x) \\\\) without applying \\\\( G(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( G(x) \\\\) first transforms the input in a different way compared to the direct application of \\\\( F(x) \\\\). Since \\\\( B(t) \\\\) can alter dynamics in a fundamentally different way compared to \\\\( A \\\\), the output at time T will be different due to the change in input trajectory influenced by \\\\( B(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
