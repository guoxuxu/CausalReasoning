  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over the complex plane as \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\). We analyze the impact of integral transformations using convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(t) = e^{-t^2} \\\\) over the real number line.\n\nKnowing the final result after sequential convolutions with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\), can we correctly infer whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was applied before or after \\\\( g(t) \\\\) based only on the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the commutative property of convolution, the order of applying \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\) cannot be distinctly determined from the final convolution outcome alone. The results of convolving with \\\\( g(t) \\\\) then \\\\( h(t) \\\\) are indistinguishable from convolving with \\\\( h(t) \\\\) then \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "convolution order → convolution outcome; Gaussian kernel g(t) → convolution outcome; function f(z) → Gaussian kernel g(t); convolution outcome → observable outcome; observable outcome → convolution order"
