  "Problem": "Consider a particle moving in a potential V(x) in one dimension governed by the Hamiltonian \\\\( H = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(x) \\\\). We investigate the effect of a linear transformation of the momentum variable \\\\( p \\\\) by a function \\\\( g(p) = ap \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant scaling factor.\n\nCan we deduce the original momentum \\\\( p_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing the position \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( g(p) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( g(p) \\\\), which scales the momentum, it's impossible to accurately trace back to the original momentum \\\\( p_0 \\\\), because the observed trajectory could correspond to multiple different initial momenta due to scaling.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
