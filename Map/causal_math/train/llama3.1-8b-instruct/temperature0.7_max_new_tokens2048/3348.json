  "Problem": "Consider a system where a function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i \\\\theta}z\\\\) acts on a complex variable \\\\(z\\\\) in the complex plane. Here, \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) is a real number representing a rotation angle. The evolution of \\\\(z\\\\) over time \\\\(t\\\\) for dynamics given by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant, is considered.\n\nCan we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\(f(z)\\\\), \\\\(g(z)\\\\), or both), based on the knowledge of \\\\(z(T)\\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Given the endpoint \\\\(z(T)\\\\), multiple combinations of initial conditions, \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\), and intervention \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) could lead to the same final position due to the circular nature of the complex plane and the rotational symmetries. Thus, identifying the precise interventions uniquely from \\\\(z(T)\\\\) is not possible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
