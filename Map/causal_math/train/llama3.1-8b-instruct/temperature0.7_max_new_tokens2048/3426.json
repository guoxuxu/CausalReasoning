  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) where x is a fixed complex number, and A is a complex constant. We investigate the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) after applying the integral transformation \\\\( w(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nGiven \\\\( w(t) \\\\), can we conclusively determine the original complex number \\\\( x \\\\) or the value of A, assuming no intervention was applied during the evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integration of a complex exponential function results in an expression where coefficients contain both the effects of A and x. Due to the nature of exponential and integral, extracting A or x uniquely from \\\\( w(t) \\\\) directly without additional information on either the initial phase or other external constraints is generally not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
