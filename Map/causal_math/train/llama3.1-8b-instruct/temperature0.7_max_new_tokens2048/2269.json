  "Problem": "Consider an electrical network consisting of resistors and capacitors governed by the equation \\\\(V(t) = U(C, R, t)\\\\) where V is the voltage, U is a function of capacitor values (C), resistance values (R) and time (t). Let a transformation be defined by \\\\(f(V) = Z^{-1}e^{At}V\\\\), where Z is the impedance matrix and A is a diagonal matrix representing frequency-dependent behavior.\n\nIf transformation \\\\(f(V)\\\\) is applied to the initial voltage \\\\(V_0\\\\) at t = 0 and the system evolves naturally, would the voltage \\\\(V(t)\\\\) at t = T be affected by the transformation compared to direct evolution under original system dynamics?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(f(V)\\\\) alters the initial conditions by the factor \\\\(Z^{-1}e^{At}\\\\) which changes the initial system state and thus impacts how the voltage evolves over time according to the impedance and frequency parameters. Different initial conditions generally lead to different outcomes in such systems.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
