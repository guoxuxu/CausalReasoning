  "Problem": "Consider a controlled heat equation on a metal rod along the x-axis modeled by \\\\(\\\\partial_t u(t, x) = k \\\\partial_{xx} u(t, x) + f(t, x)\\\\), where u represents the temperature at position x and time t, k is the thermal diffusivity constant, and \\\\(f(t, x)\\\\) is a heating function that varies with time and position.\n\nGiven the temperature profile \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) at time T, can we uniquely determine the initial heat source \\\\( f(0, x) \\\\) applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The heat equation's solutions can be significantly impacted by initial temperature distributions that are not solely attributable to \\\\( f(0, x) \\\\). Multiple initial conditions and heat distributions can lead to the same temperature profile at a later time depending on the heat conductivity and boundary conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
