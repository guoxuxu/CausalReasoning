  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real frequency parameter. The effect of a transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = e^{at}z \\\\) is examined, where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), based solely on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The same endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from different sequences or magnitudes of interventions. The exponential properties of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) in \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{bt} \\\\), respectively, influence \\\\( z(T) \\\\) in a way that can yield similar outcomes for various combinations of \\\\( a \\\\), \\\\( b \\\\), and \\\\( t_1 \\\\). Without more specific information about these parameters, the particular interventions cannot be uniquely identified from the endpoint alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
