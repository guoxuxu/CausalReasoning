  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u\\\\), where D is a diffusion coefficient. We study the influence of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), to the initial condition \\\\(u(x,0)\\\\) of the system.\n\nCan we ascertain the specific transformations applied (Fourier transform, Laplace transform, or both) prior to time T by exclusively analyzing the state \\\\(u(x,T)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining which transformations were applied specifically is complicated by the fact that both transforms manipulate the frequency and structure of the initial condition in overlapping ways. The diffusive nature of the PDE further mixes these influences, rendering it practically impossible to disentangle the effects and identify the exact transformations used solely based on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
