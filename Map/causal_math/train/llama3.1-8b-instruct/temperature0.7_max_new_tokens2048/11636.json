  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions where \\\\(z(t) = exp(i \\\\omega t)\\\\) with \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) being a real constant. We are examining how applying the Laplace transform affects the behavior of \\\\(z\\\\) over time and how interventions through different parameters might impact the eventual outcome.\n\nCan we deduce precisely whether \\\\(g(t)\\\\) or any other specific damping was applied to \\\\(z(t)\\\\) only by observing the output at some \\\\(t = T\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific interventions like \\\\(g(t)\\\\) from the endpoint without detailed knowledge of the behavior throughout the interval or without additional system-specific data is non-trivial. Multiple intervention strategies can yield similarly damped outcomes, making it impossible to uniquely identify the modifications based solely on final observations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
