  "Problem": "Consider a function space influenced by the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) and consider the integral transform \\\\( T[f](x) = \\\\int_{a}^{b} K(x, t) f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( K(x, t) \\\\) is the kernel of the transform. The challenge is to assess how transformations and inverses of these operators affect the functions within this space.\n\nSuppose an additional operation \\\\( M \\\\) is applied to the function space after transformation \\\\( T \\\\), which modifies each function. Will the end results be independent of the original operator \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a new operation \\\\( M \\\\) following the transformation by \\\\( T \\\\) will still reflect the original modifications by \\\\( L \\\\). Since these operators can significantly vary how they transform their subject functions, the final outcome will be contingent on both \\\\( L \\\\) and \\\\( M \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
