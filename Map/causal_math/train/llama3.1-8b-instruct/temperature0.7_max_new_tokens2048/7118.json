  "Problem": "Let \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\) represent a transfer function in the Laplace transform domain, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We consider the impact of applying a sinusoidal input \\\\( x(t) = \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) and an impulsive function \\\\( \\delta(t - T) \\\\) as inputs into the system described by H(s).\n\nAfter observing the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at time t = T, can we conclude that only the sinusoidal input \\\\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\\\) was applied without knowing whether there was an impulse at \\\\( t = T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit information about the presence of an impulse input, \\\\( \\delta(t - T) \\\\), it is difficult to differentiate whether the observed effects at time T are due solely to the sinusoidal input or a combined effect of both inputs, given the potential additional contribution from the impulse.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
