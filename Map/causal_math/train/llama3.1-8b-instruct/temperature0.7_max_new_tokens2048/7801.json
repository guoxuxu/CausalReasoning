  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) representing the solution to a system of linear differential equations with a matrix A. An external operator modifies the trajectory through a time-dependent matrix transformation \\\\( g(t) = e^{Bt} \\\\), where B is also a constant matrix.\n\nIs the solution at time T, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), equivalent to \\\\( e^{AT}x \\\\) if initially at time t = 0 we apply \\\\( g(0) \\\\) to \\\\( x \\\\) and then let it evolve under the original system without any further modification?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(0) = I \\\\) (identity since Bt equals 0 at t = 0) does not change \\\\( x \\\\) initially, but since the system evolves according to \\\\( A \\\\) and not \\\\( B \\\\), the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\) treated as a separate entity will influence the trajectory differently than \\\\( A \\\\) over time, making the final state \\\\( e^{AT}x \\\\) altered by the interaction between A and B.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
