  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by the equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We also define a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a complex constant and t represents time.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve according to \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = i\\\\omega z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha \\\\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0 \\\\) initially, but as t increases, the factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) changes the magnitude and possibly the phase of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), resulting in a different trajectory compared to simple evolution by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
