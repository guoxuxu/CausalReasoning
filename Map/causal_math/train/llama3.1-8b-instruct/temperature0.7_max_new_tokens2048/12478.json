  "Problem": "In the context of electrical circuits, consider a linear system represented by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The system is subject to the input \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and produces output \\\\( y(t) \\\\). We explore the effect of a Laplace transform on this system, focusing on the transfer function modification \\\\( H(s) \\\\) changing to \\\\( H(s) + K(s) \\\\), where \\\\( K(s) \\\\) is another transfer function.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an additional input modification \\\\( x'(t) = L\\{x(t)\\} \\\\) using an operator L is applied to the system, will the output \\\\( y''(t) \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) only depend on \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and not on \\\\( K(s) \\\\) or Laplace operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of both the transformation \\\\( K(s) \\\\) and the Laplace operator L modifies the input-output relationship. The output \\\\( y''(t) \\\\) at time T will depend not only on the original transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\) but also critically on \\\\( K(s) \\\\) and the transformative properties of L, which alters the input \\\\( x'(t) \\\\) and hence the system response.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
