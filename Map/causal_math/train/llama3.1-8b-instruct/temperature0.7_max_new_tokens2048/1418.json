  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of an integral transformation on a function's Fourier transform. Suppose we have a function \\\\( g(x) = \\\\sin(x) \\\\) and we apply the transformation \\\\( T(g)(x) = \\\\int_0^x g(t) dt \\\\). Consider the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) as applied on both \\\\( g(x) \\\\) and \\\\( T(g)(x) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform of a transformed function \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(g))(\\\\omega) \\\\), can one unequivocally deduce whether the transformation \\\\( T \\\\) or an equivalent operation was applied to \\\\( g(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "While differences in the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(T(g))(\\\\omega) \\\\) relative to \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) can indicate changes, they do not uniquely confirm that the integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) was applied, as different transformations can lead to similar spectral changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
