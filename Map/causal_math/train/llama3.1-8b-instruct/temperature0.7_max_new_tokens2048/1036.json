  "Problem": "Consider the behavior of a complex scalar function z(t) governed by \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az + B\\\\sin(wt)\\\\), where A and B are complex constants, and w is a real constant. We evaluate the effect of applying a transformation defined by \\\\(h(z) = e^{Ct}z + D\\\\), where C and D are complex constants, at different points in time.\n\nIs it possible to uniquely determine the interventions (whether \\\\(h(z)\\\\), \\\\(j(z)\\\\), or both) applied from the trajectory analysis at point \\\\(z(T)\\\\), if multiple potential intervening transformations might have similar effects?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple combinations of \\\\(C\\\\), \\\\(D\\\\), and \\\\(F\\\\) may result in similar trajectories due to the exponential interaction complexity and overlapping effects, especially influenced by the base behavior defined by A and B. Thus, identifying specific interventions from the endpoint alone may lead to ambiguous, non-unique interpretations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
