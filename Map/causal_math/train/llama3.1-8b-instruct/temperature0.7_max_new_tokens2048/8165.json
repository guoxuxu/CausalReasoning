  "Problem": "Consider the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\) where \\\\(t\\\\) is time, \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\) are constant matrices, and \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state vector of the system. We analyze how the integral transformation \\\\(X(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{B(t-s)}z(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(B\\\\) is another constant matrix, influences the state over time.\n\nIf the integral transformation \\\\(X(t)\\\\) is executed starting from \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 and evolves according to \\\\(z(t)\\\\), will the function \\\\(X(T)\\\\) be the same as having applied \\\\(X(t)\\\\) under the dynamics \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\) for all \\\\(t\\\\) without additional influences?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\(X(t)\\\\) depends not only on \\\\(z(t)\\\\) but also on the interplay between the matrices \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\). Since \\\\(X(t)\\\\) incorporates the entire history of \\\\(z(s)\\\\) up to time \\\\(t\\\\), modified by \\\\(B\\\\), its final value at \\\\(T\\\\) will differ when the system's history is altered by \\\\(B\\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
