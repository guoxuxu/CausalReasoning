  "Problem": "Evaluate the causal impact in a nonlinear system characterized by the function \\\\( z = f(x,y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\\\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are variables. We consider the application of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to variable \\( z \\).\n\nGiven \\( g(z) \\) at a certain value, can we revert back to determine the exact values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) without knowing the transformation \\( g \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( g(z) = e^{z} \\) is not injective over the complex numbers, and multiple pairs of \\( (x, y) \\) might yield the same \\( z \\), thus the same \\( g(z) \\). Additionally, \\( e^{z} \\) exponentially increases with \\( z \\), making it sensitive to slight changes in \\( z \\) and effectively impossible to uniquely reverse engineer \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) without further information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
