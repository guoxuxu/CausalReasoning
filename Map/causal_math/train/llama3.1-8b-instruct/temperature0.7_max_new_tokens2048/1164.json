  "Problem": "Investigate a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\\\omega \\\\tau} x(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a real-valued continuous function of time, and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We seek to determine the implications of introducing a perturbation by the function \\\\( f(x) = x + c\\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the sequence of perturbations applied (nature and order of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x) \\\\)), based solely on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) does not uniquely indicate the specific perturbations used, as various combinations and sequences of operations (perturbing and then restoring, or the reverse) can yield the same result at \\\\( T \\\\). This results in an inability to exactly deduce the history and sequence of perturbations only based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
