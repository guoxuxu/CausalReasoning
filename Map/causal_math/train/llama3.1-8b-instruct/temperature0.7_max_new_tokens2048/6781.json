  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) defined as \\\\( G(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex number. We explore the effect of a linear operator \\\\( L \\\\) on \\\\( g(x) \\\\) before the transformation, where \\\\( Lg(x) = xg(x) \\\\).\n\nIf the operator \\\\( L \\\\) is applied to \\\\( g(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( Lg(x) \\\\) and then \\\\( G(s) \\\\) is computed for \\\\( Lg(x) \\\\), will \\\\( G(s) \\\\) be equal to the original transform \\\\( G(s) \\\\) of \\\\( g(x) \\\\) without applying \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( L \\\\) changes the function to \\\\( xg(x) \\\\), thus altering the integrand in the transform to \\\\( e^{-sx} xg(x) \\\\). This results in the derivative with respect to \\\\( s \\\\) of the original transform, \\\\( -G'(s) \\\\), due to integration by parts, which clearly differs from \\\\( G(s) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
