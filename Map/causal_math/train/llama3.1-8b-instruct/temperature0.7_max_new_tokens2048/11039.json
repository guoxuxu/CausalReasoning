  "Problem": "Consider the response of a complex system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform on the initial condition \\\\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\\\) and then allowing the system to evolve.\n\nIf an intervention is applied where a new function \\\\( \\\\hat{v}(\\\\xi, t_1) = \\\\hat{u}(\\\\xi, t_1) e^{-Ct} \\\\) (where C is a constant) is used at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to modify the state, will the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend only on the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the state of the system at \\\\( t_1 \\\\), affecting the trajectory of the evolution. The final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) will be influenced by both the original differential operator L and the new modification factor introduced by the exponential term \\\\( e^{-Ct} \\\\), indicating dependency on factors beyond just L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
