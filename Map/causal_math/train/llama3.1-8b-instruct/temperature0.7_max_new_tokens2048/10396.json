  "Problem": "Consider a discrete-time system governed by the equation \\\\( x_{n+1} = f(x_n) \\\\\\), where \\\\( f(x) = A x \\\\) with A being a square matrix. We also use a linear operator \\\\( T(x) = B x \\\\), where B is another square matrix, to transform the initial state.\n\nKnowing the end state \\\\( x_N \\\\), can we accurately deduce what interventions (application of \\\\( T(x) \\\\), \\\\( S(x) \\\\), or both) were utilized during the evolution, based solely on the value of \\\\( x_N \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Similar end states \\\\( x_N \\\\) could result from different initial and intermediate transformations due to the properties of matrix multiplication and the potential for B and C to have similar or overlapping effects when combined with A. Without additional information, it is not possible to uniquely identify which transformations were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
