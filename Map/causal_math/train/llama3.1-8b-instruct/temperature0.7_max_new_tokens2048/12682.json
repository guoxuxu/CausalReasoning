  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( g(z) = e^{az} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We examine the effect of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and its implications over the variable \\\\( s \\\\).\n\nIf an operator \\\\( L[f](t) = f'(t) + bf(t) \\\\) (where \\\\( b \\\\) is another complex constant) is applied to \\\\( g(t) \\\\) after the original transformation \\\\( T \\\\), will the new endpoint depend solely on \\\\( s \\\\) and not on \\\\( a \\\\) or \\\\( b \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operator \\\\( L \\\\) changes the nature and the trajectory of the function. \\\\( L[g](t) = a e^{at} + b e^{at} = (a+b) e^{at} \\\\), and then taking \\\\( T[L[g]](s) \\\\) would yield \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\\\), thus showing dependence on both \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), alongside \\\\( s \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
