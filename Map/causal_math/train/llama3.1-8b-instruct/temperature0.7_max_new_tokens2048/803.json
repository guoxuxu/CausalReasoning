  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\\\) that describes heat diffusion in a rod. We investigate the effect of an initial condition transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{w x} \\\\), where w is a constant.\n\nIf a function \\\\( h(u) = u + e^{-wx}y \\\\) is applied halfway through the propagation at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the endpoint \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on the heat diffusion equation and not on \\\\( g(u) \\\\) or \\\\( h(u) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention function \\\\( h(u) \\\\) introduces another specific alteration, making the final state \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) dependent on both the initial transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and the intervention \\\\( h(u) \\\\). These transformations affect the heat equation's natural evolution and thus the resultant temperature profile at time T.",
