  "Problem": "Consider a scenario involving a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined as \\\\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{As}x(s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a time-dependent vector function and A is a constant matrix. The transformation used is \\\\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), with B also being a constant matrix.\n\nIf an intervention using a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) (where C is another constant matrix) is applied at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) be determined solely by the dynamics governed by A?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the intervention \\\\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) introduces another layer of complexity. The outcome \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by the original matrix A, as well as matrices B and C due to the transformations applied, making the final state a product of all these factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
