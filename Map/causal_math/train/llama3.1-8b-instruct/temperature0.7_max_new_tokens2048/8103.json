  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a linear operator. We investigate the effects of applying a Fourier transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\\\), on this system.\n\nIf an intervention occurs at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) by applying a different operator M to the spatial domain, altering \\\\(u(x, t_1)\\\\), will the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) for T > t_1 be independent of the original operator L?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with operator M modifies the state at \\\\(t_1\\\\), but the subsequent evolution is affected by both the properties of L and how these are transformed into the Fourier domain. Hence, \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) depends on both L and M, reflecting the compounded effects of both operators on the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
