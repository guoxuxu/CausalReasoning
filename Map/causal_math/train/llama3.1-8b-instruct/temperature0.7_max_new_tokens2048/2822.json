  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system where the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\) is used. We explore the properties as \\\\( z \\\\) undergoes transformations along the real and imaginary axes respectively in the complex plane, under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = az + bi \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are real numbers.\n\nAfter observing the output of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) at a transformed point \\\\( z' = h(z_0) \\\\), can one deduce the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) unambiguously?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-invertibility and non-linearity in the transformation and exponential function, multiple different complex numbers could yield the same output under \\\\( g(z) \\\\). Without exact information about the transformation parameters \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\), it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from the observed output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
