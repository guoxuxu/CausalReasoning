  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant complex matrix. The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Nt}z \\\\) represents a transformation over time t, where \\\\( N \\\\) is another constant complex matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), only by knowing the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone does not provide enough information to uniquely ascertain the interventions due to potential non-uniqueness in the solutions stemming from the non-commutative properties of matrix exponentials and varying initial conditions and transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
