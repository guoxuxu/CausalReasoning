  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant coefficients. Analyze the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sC} f(s) ds \\\\), where C is a constant coefficient, on this complex function over time t.\n\nBy knowing the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we precisely determine which transformations (whether \\\\( T(f) \\\\), \\\\( S(g) \\\\), or both) were applied during the timeline 0 to T?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the exact transformations used is not feasible solely from the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) because different combinations of transformations and their parameters (C and D) could lead to the same or indistinguishable endpoints. The overlap in possible effects from each transformation masks their individual impacts.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
