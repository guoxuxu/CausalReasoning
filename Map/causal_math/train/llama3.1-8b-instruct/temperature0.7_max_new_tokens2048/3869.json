  "Problem": "Consider a function \\( u(x, t) \\) governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\), where \\( L \\) is a linear differential operator. Analyze the effect of an integral transformation \\( T \\) defined by \\( T[u](x, t) = \\int K(x, y, t) u(y, t) dy \\), where \\( K \\) is a kernel function.\n\nIf \\( T[u](x, 0) \\) is applied to \\( u(x, 0) \\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\) without further intervention, will \\( u(x, T) \\) at t = T be the same as if \\( u(x, 0) \\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\( T \\) modifies the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\), thereby altering the evolution path. The kernel function \\( K \\) can introduce changes to the spatial distribution that affect how \\( u \\) evolves under \\( L \\), leading to a different state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
