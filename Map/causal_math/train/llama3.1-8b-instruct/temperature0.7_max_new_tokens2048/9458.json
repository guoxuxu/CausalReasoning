  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) that satisfies the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\lambda \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) are constants. We explore the effects of the linear operator transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\tau e^{st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over different time spans \\\\( \\\\tau \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the specific function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over the interval \\\\( [0, \\\\tau] \\\\) by knowing the output of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alone, if no further details are given?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) represents an integral transform which aggregates information and is therefore non-invertible without additional constraints or data about \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Multiple different functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) could potentially yield the same result when processed by \\\\( T(z) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
