  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\), where u and v are real-valued functions of time governed by a nonlinear differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = (i\\\\omega + \\\\lambda)z + k|z|^2z \\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega, \\\\lambda\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\) are constants. The scenario explores the consequences of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) on the complex function's behavior over time, with \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) as a complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention with a new function \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) while the system still evolves according to the original differential equation thereafter, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the parameters (\\\\(\\\\omega, \\\\lambda, k\\\\)) of the original equation?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces additional complexities through further scaling and rotation, modifying the continuous evolution under the original parameters. This imposes an additional transformation that interacts with the nonlinearity, making the system's endpoint reliant also on the new parameters introduced by \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
