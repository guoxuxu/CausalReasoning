  "Problem": "In this scenario, we consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). This scenario investigates how the causal relationship between functions and their transforms behaves with or without interventions in the form of function modification.\n\nBased on the information \\\\( G(s) = F(s) + \\\\frac{2}{s} \\\\), can we unequivocally infer that the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) had a constant 2 added to it?",
  "Explanation": "While \\\\( G(s) \\\\) suggests the addition of a constant, without knowing the specifics of \\\\( F(s) \\\\), it's possible that alternative transformations or initial states led to equivalent outcomes in the Laplace domain, especially in complex functions where scaling and shifts may mask true causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
