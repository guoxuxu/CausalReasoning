  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), defined by the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\) where A, B, C, and D are constants. We examine the effects of an integral transform, specifically the Laplace transform, on the solution of the system over time t.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to uniquely identify whether transformations like the Laplace or Fourier transform were applied during the evolution of the system?",
  "Explanation": "The transformations might influence the system in ways that are not directly reversible or distinguishable at the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The combined effects of these transformations, especially if they alter phase and amplitude in complex ways, make it infeasible to uniquely backtrack the specific interventions used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
