  "Problem": "Let's consider a linear system governed by the matrix equation \\\\( dx/dt = Lx \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator. We examine the system's behavior under the Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\) is applied to the function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and then allowed to evolve by \\\\( L \\\\) without any further processing, will the Fourier transform at a later time \\\\( \\Omega \\\\) be the same as if the original function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) had been directly evolved using \\\\( L \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The act of applying the Fourier transform changes the representation of the function from time domain to frequency domain. Since \\\\( L \\\\) directly influences the time domain representation, and operations in the frequency domain can have different implications due to convolution properties and frequency shifts, the outcomes differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
