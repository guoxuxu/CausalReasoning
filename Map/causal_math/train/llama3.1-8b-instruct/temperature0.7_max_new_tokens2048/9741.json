  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + pz + q \\\\), where \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\) are complex numbers. We study the changes in the integral along a path in the complex plane, comparing before and after a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a constant complex number.\n\nIf the path of integration originally from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\) is redefined to start and end at points transformed by \\\\( g(z) \\\\), and \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is integrated along this new path, will the result equal the integral of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) along the original path from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( z_1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + c \\\\) alters the starting and ending points of the integration path. Even though the function itself is the same, changing the path affects the bounds of integration, leading to different values in the complex integration, considering that the integration path determines the contribution of the complex function's values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
