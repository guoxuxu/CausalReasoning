  "Problem": "Assume a system defined by the integral equation \\\\( y = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}x(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) a time-varying vector function. We further explore the effects of applying a Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to analyze this system, shifting a complex variable \\\\( s \\\\) to observe causal relationships.\n\nKnowing just the final form \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the s-domain, can we precisely determine the nature and timing of the intervention with matrix \\\\( M \\\\), assuming \\\\( M \\\\) was used?",
  "Explanation": "Deducing the exact nature and specific application timing of the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) only from the function \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) is challenging due to the potential for similar transformations from various matrices or timings to result in indistinguishably similar s-domain characteristics. Factors such as commutativity, eigenvalues, and singularities related to \\\\( M \\\\) and \\\\( A \\\\) can produce overlapping effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
