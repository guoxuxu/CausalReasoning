  "Problem": "Consider a closed-loop control system where the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is passed through a system characterized by a transfer function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} \\\\), and the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) is regulated to meet certain performance specifications. We investigate the implications of introducing a disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) modeled by \\\\( D(s) = \\\\frac{5}{s+2} \\\\) on the output.\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( u(t) \\\\) is applied and the system evolves according to \\\\( H(s) \\\\), will the disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\) affect the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) even if there is no intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The disturbance \\\\( d(t) \\\\), represented by \\\\( D(s) \\\\), independently adds to the system’s output alongside the input signal through the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). This affects the output regardless of any direct intervention on the input, altering the overall system dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
