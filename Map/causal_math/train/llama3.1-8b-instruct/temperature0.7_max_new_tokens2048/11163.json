  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. To analyze causal inferences, we introduce an integral transform \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Qt}z(t) dt \\\\), where Q is another complex constant.\n\nIf an intervention in the form of a function alteration \\\\( h(z) = e^{Rt}z \\\\) (where R is another complex constant) is applied at a certain midpoint \\\\( t_2 \\\\), does the ultimate function form \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) for T > t_2 depend only on P?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces a new influencing factor. The final form of \\\\( g(z)(T) \\\\) is a product of the cumulative effects of P, Q, and now R, integral and exponential transformations potentially alter the trajectory considerably.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
