  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + L(u) = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We investigate the behavior when a transformation \\\\( T(u) = u e^{ikx} \\\\) is applied, with \\\\( k \\\\) being a constant and \\\\( x \\\\) the spatial variable.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( S(u) = u e^{-ikx} \\\\) (where \\\\( -k \\\\) is a constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( L \\\\) and not on \\\\( k \\\\) or other parameters introduced by \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( S(u) \\\\) introduces another transformation, which might cancel or amplify particular effects introduced by \\\\( T(u) \\\\). The final state \\\\( u(T, x) \\\\) at time T will depend significantly on how these exponential factors interact and potentially modify the impact of \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
