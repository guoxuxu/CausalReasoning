  "Problem": "Consider a wave equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) defined in a one-dimensional space. We examine the effects of a Fourier transform applied to u(x,0) to analyze the wave's behavior.\n\nBased on the observed state of the wave \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at some time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) after the filtering intervention, can we determine exactly whether the intervention took place, only by analyzing the waveform at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The filtering process can create changes in the wave's spectral composition that might mimic or mask the effects of natural evolution under the wave equation. Without explicit knowledge of the intervention (i.e., knowing whether and how \\\\( h(k) \\\\) was applied), precise identification is unclear just from observing \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transform → u(x,0); u(x,0) → u(x,T); Fourier transform → u(x,T); t1 → T; t1 → Fourier transform; u(x,T) → whether intervention took place"
