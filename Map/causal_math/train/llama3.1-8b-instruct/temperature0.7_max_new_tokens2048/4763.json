  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model involving the heat equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant, and we apply a Fourier transform to the spatial variable \\\\(x\\\\) to convert it to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}_t = -k\\\\omega^2\\\\hat{u}\\\\). We are interested in analyzing how transformations in the frequency domain using a function \\\\( f(\\\\hat{u}) = e^{-a\\\\omega^2 t}\\\\hat{u} \\\\) affect the system's behavior over time \\\\(t\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( g(\\\\hat{u}) = e^{-b\\\\omega^2 t}\\\\hat{u} \\\\) (where \\\\(b\\\\) is another constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 be influenced by both \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\), and not just by \\\\(k\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( g(\\\\hat{u}) \\\\) introduces a second modulating factor, affecting the rate of decay differently depending on the frequency component \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\). This means the final state \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(T) \\\\) will be determined by the interaction of both diffusion and the transformations represented by \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\), fundamentally altering the system's outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
