  "Problem": "Consider a function defined as \\\\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyse how this function transforms under the operation of a complex integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](s) = \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} e^{-isx} f(x) dx \\\\).\n\nIf an additional function \\\\( w(x) = e^{-2ix} \\\\) is multiplied to \\\\( z(x) \\\\) at some point before applying \\\\( T \\\\), will the resultant transform \\\\( T[wz](s) \\\\) still produce a Dirac delta function at \\\\( s = 1 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( w(x) \\\\) changes the function to \\\\( wz(x) = e^{-ix} \\\\), whose Fourier transform or resultant under \\\\( T \\\\) will yield a Dirac delta function centered at \\\\( s = -1 \\\\) rather than \\\\( s = 1 \\\\). The new function \\\\( wz(x) \\\\) shifts the frequency component, thereby altering the resultant transformed function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
