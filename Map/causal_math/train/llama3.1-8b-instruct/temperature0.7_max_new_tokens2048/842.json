  "Problem": "Consider a continuous time system where the output \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is defined by the equation \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} K(s)y(s) ds \\\\), with \\\\( K(s) \\\\) and \\\\( y(s) \\\\) representing kernel and input functions, respectively. We investigate the effect of an input transformation \\\\( y'(s) = y(s) + h(s) \\\\), where \\\\( h(s) \\\\) is another function, on the output over time.\n\nCan we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( y(s) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( y'(s) = y(s) + h(s) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation was applied, we cannot distinguish between effects caused by \\\\( y(s) \\\\) alone or the combined effect of \\\\( y(s) + h(s) \\\\). This uncertainty arises because both input scenarios could potentially yield the same output depending on the functions involved.",
