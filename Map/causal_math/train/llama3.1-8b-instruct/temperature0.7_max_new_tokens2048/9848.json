  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} \\\\) applied to a variable \\\\( z \\\\) in the complex plane. The impact of this transformation is studied over the path of the unit circle in the complex plane, described by \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( t \\in [0, 2\\\\pi] \\\\).\n\nGiven the ending point on the path at \\\\( t = 2\\\\pi \\\\), and knowing that an intervention was applied, can we reliably determine which transformations (\\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) were used?",
  "Explanation": "Given the symmetrical nature of the unit circle and the type of transformations, multiple combination scenarios (applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) can lead to the same endpoint on the circle. The transformations' effects are not distinct enough to uniquely backtrack the applied sequence from the final point alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
