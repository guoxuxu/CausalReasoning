  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the system's behavior under the influence of the transformation \\\\( f(x) = S^{-1}e^{Mt}Sx \\\\), where M is another constant matrix and S is a matrix that diagonalizes D, i.e., \\\\( SDS^{-1} = \\\\Lambda \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\Lambda \\\\) being a diagonal matrix.\n\nIf we apply \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) at time t = 0 and let the system evolve according to \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\) without any additional changes, will the vector \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at time T be the same as when the system evolves from \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without applying \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) at t = 0 modifies the initial condition and thus changes the trajectory. The presence of the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{Mt} \\\\) along with the similarity transformation by S means the evolution from the modified initial condition diverges from that of the unmodified \\\\( x_0 \\\\), resulting in a different state at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
