  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time, evolved under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Pz \\\\) with \\\\( P \\\\) being a constant matrix. We also incorporate the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Qt}z \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is another constant matrix, to observe changes over time t.\n\nCan the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 be exactly deduced after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), it is impossible to determine whether the observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at T was directly evolved from \\\\( z_0 \\\\) or transformed by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\). The initial condition's modification by \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) may be non-reversible, especially if Q does not commute with P, thus leaving ambiguity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
