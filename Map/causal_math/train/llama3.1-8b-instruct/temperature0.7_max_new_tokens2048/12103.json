  "Problem": "Investigate a complex dynamical system where the output \\( z(t) \\) is influenced by the input \\( x(t) \\) according to a Laplace transform relationship \\( Z(s) = X(s)/s \\). Here, \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Z(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( z(t) \\) respectively, with \\( s \\) being a complex variable.\n\nGiven an observation \\( z(T) \\) at time T, can it be determined if an intervention occurred or the nature of the intervention based solely on \\( z(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the properties of Laplace transforms and the possible overlapping effects of varied input modifications, identifying specific interventions or determining their exact nature from \\( z(T) \\) only is not feasible without additional contextual information about the changes to \\( x(t) \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x(t) → Z(s); Z(s) → z(t); z(T) → intervention nature; z(T) → intervention occurrence"
