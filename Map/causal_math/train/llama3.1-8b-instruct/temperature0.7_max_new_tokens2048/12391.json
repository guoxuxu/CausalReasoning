  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of a Laplace transform which converts this time function into the complex frequency domain.\n\nGiven observing the output of the Laplace transform after an unknown intervention was made during its initial transformation, can one deduce the exact nature of this intervention (say multiplication by \\\\( e^{-kt} \\\\)) solely based on the modified \\\\( Z(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The altered \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) resulting from the intervention could have been caused by any number of modifications which alter the decay or frequency characteristics, making it impossible to uniquely determine which specific intervention was applied without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "time t → function z(t); t → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → Z(s); \n intervention (multiplication by e^(-kt)) → modified z(t); modified z(t) → modified Laplace transform; \n modified Laplace transform → Z(s); time t → imaginary unit i; imaginary unit i → function z(t); \n function z(t) → e^it; e^it → Laplace transform; Laplace transform → Z(s)"
