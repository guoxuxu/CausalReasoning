  "Problem": "Examine the relationship between two complex functions \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) and \\\\( w(t) = \\log(z(t)) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( \\log \\\\) denotes the complex logarithm. Consider the effects of the linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = az + b \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( b \\\\) are complex constants.\n\nCan the precise sequence or type of interventions (i.e., \\\\( T \\\\) or \\\\( S \\\\) or both) be deduced directly by observing the endpoint \\\\( w(T) \\\\), given multiple possible transformations?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( w(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of transformations applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Since both \\\\( T \\\\) and \\\\( S \\\\) could induce changes that yield the same final state in \\\\( w(T) \\\\), particularly due to the complexity and overlap of potential paths in complex function dynamics, it is impossible to conclusively determine the interventions used solely based on the endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
