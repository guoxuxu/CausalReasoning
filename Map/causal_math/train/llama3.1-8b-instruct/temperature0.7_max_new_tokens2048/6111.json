  "Problem": "Examine a continuous mathematical model using a Fourier transform, where a function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) representing a signal is transformed into a frequency domain represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\). The causal properties of the system are influenced when a filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) = e^{-a\\\\omega^2} \\\\), with a real constant \\\\( a \\\\), is applied, where \\\\( a \\\\) affects the attenuation of the signal's components depending on their frequency.\n\nIf another transformation \\\\( G(\\\\omega) = e^{b\\\\omega^2} \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is a constant, is applied as an intervention halfway through the observation period, will the final state of the signal in the time domain be solely dependent on the initial filter \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent application of \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\) introduces additional modifications to the frequency components, which are compounded with those made by \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\). The final signal form in the time domain depends on both filters, \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) and \\\\( G(\\\\omega) \\\\), their specific interaction, and how they modify the spectral properties of the signal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
