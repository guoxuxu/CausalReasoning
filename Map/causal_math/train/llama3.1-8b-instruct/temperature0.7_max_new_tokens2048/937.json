  "Problem": "Consider a system of ordinary differential equations given by \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt} z(t) = M z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. Let's analyze the behavior under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = D e^{-Mt} z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix.\n\nIf \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied to a vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at \\\\( t=0 \\\\), followed by its evolution according to the differential equation without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at \\\\( T > 0 \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) evolved directly under the equation without the transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) initially modifies the state \\\\( z(0) \\\\) to \\\\( Dz_0 \\\\), affecting the trajectory. The solution to the ODE starting from this new initial condition \\\\( Dz_0 \\\\) evolves differently compared to starting from \\\\( z_0 \\\\), due to the action of \\\\( D \\\\) and its interaction with \\\\( M \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
