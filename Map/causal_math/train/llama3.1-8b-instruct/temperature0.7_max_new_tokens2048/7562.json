  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where x and y are the real and imaginary parts of z respectively, governed by the equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. The function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is a constant matrix, is used for transformation of z over time t.\n\nCan we reconstruct the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing its state at \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The effects of the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) on the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) cannot be definitively traced back without specific knowledge about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), especially given the complex interactions and the potential non-commutativity of the matrices involved.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
