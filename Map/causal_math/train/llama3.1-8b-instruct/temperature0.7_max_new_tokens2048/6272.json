  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency, and let's analyze its behavior under the integral transformation \\\\( I[z](t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\omega s}z(s)ds \\\\).\n\nIf we observe a non-zero output from the integral transformation at time \\\\( t \\\\), can we precisely determine what phase shift or other transformations were applied during the process?",
  "Explanation": "While a non-zero result indicates that some transformation like a phase shift might have been applied, the exact nature and parameters of such transformation (like the value of \\\\( \\phi \\\\)) cannot be uniquely determined based solely on a non-zero result due to potential multi-phase or compound interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
