  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model where the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves in time under the influence of a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) defined as \\\\( Lz = \\\\frac{dz}{dt} + az \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We scrutinize the effects of applying the transformation \\\\( T(z) = e^{bt}z \\\\), where \\\\( b \\\\) is another complex constant, and observe the causal relationships and system dynamics.\n\nGiven the final observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to unambiguously determine the interventions applied (whether \\\\( T(z) \\\\), \\\\( U(z) \\\\), or both) solely based on \\\\( z(T) \\\\) value?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can result from various combinations of transformations and their timings, owing to the complex exponential nature of the transformations. Without additional information about the specific transformation constants \\\\( b \\\\) and \\\\( c \\\\), or their application timings, the precise interventions cannot be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
