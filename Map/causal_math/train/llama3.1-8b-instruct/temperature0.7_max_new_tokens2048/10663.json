  "Problem": "Assume the behavior of a complex system can be modeled by the equation \\\\(z(t) = Ce^{At}z_0\\\\), where \\\\(z_0\\\\) is the initial state in complex space, and A and C are constant complex matrices. Manipulations on the system are achieved by applying the transformation \\\\(h(z) = Dze^{Bt}\\\\), where D and B are also constant complex matrices.\n\nIf an intervention via a new transformation \\\\(k(z) = Fze^{Et}\\\\) (where E and F are constant matrices) is applied at some t = t1, will the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\) at T > t1 depend only on A and not on B, D, E, or F?",
  "Explanation": "The new intervention further modifies the state, making the eventual outcome dependent on the interplay of all matrices involved (A, B, C, D, E, F). These matrix transformations will collectively influence the system's evolution through their respective effects.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
