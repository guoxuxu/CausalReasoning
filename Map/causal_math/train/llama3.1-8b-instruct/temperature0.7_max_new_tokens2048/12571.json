  "Problem": "Imagine a system of differential equations given by \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt} z(t) = Kz(t)\\\\), where K is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the effects of an integral transform defined by \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Mt}z(t) dt \\\\), where M is another constant matrix.\n\nBased on the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we accurately determine the transformations used (like \\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( q(z) \\\\) or both) throughout the system's evolution, solely by analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying which transformations were applied during the system’s evolution by only evaluating \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is not feasible due to the overlapping effects of matrix exponentials and the integrating operation. Different combinations of transformations could lead to the same final state due to the non-distinct and potentially similar evolving paths they engender.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
