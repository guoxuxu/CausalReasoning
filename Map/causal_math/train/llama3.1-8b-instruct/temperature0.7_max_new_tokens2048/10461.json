  "Problem": "Let's consider a complex function scenario where the function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) evolves over time, under the influence of a transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where A is a complex constant and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve naturally without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was allowed to evolve naturally to T without transformation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) initially changes the trajectory of the complex function due to the exponential multiplier \\\\( e^{At} \\\\), which scales and rotates \\\\( z_0 \\\\) in the complex plane. Thus, the final point \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is different due to the initial transformation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
