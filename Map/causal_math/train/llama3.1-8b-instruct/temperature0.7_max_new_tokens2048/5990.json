  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) described by a pair of coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), where A and B are constants. Explore the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( T[z(t)] = \\\\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\\\) on this system over time t.\n\nCan we conclusively determine the original function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) having evolved under \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\) and the given differential equations, without explicit knowledge about the application of \\\\( T[z(t)] \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the integral transformation introduces a memory of all past states weighted by an exponential decay, which obscures the original state. Not knowing whether the transformation was applied means we cannot uniquely determine \\\\( z_0 \\\\) from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) since the transformation could have significantly altered the evolution path.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
