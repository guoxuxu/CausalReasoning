  "Problem": "Consider a system where the surface area of a sphere changes over time according to the radius which grows linearly with time according to the equation \\\\( r(t) = kt \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. The rate of change of the surface area, \\\\( S \\\\), with time can be derived using the formula \\\\( S = 4\\\\pi r^2 \\\\). We examine how transformations defined by the function \\\\( f(r) = \\\\alpha r(t) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a scaling constant, influence the rate of change of the sphere's surface area over time.\n\nGiven the surface area \\\\( S(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the original radius \\\\( r_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(r) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The observed surface area \\\\( S(T) \\\\) provides insufficient information to determine whether scaling was applied at the initial stage or not, as multiple combinations of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( r_0 \\\\) could yield the same final surface area due to the quadratic dependency on radius.",
