  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At} x_0 \\\\), where A is a matrix with complex eigenvalues. This function represents the solution to a system of linear differential equations. We explore the effect using a Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t); s) \\\\) as an analytic continuation in the complex plane.\n\nIf the Laplace transform, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), is applied to the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) without further influence, will the solution in the s-domain, \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), exactly represent the original dynamical behavior of the system for all s?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is a bijective linear transform in the context of linear differential equations with constant coefficients, here ensured by the matrix A. It correctly transforms the time-domain behavior of the system into the s-domain, preserving the entire dynamics of the system including initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
