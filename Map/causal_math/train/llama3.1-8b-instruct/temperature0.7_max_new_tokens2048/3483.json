  "Problem": "Consider the integral transform defined by \\\\( F(x) = \\\\int_0^x e^{t^2} dt \\\\). We study the implications of modifying this integral using a linear transformation of the variable x given by the function \\\\( g(x) = ax + b \\\\), where a and b are constants.\n\nIf at some x = t, an intervention modifies x to \\\\( h(x) = cx + d \\\\) (c and d are constants), then will \\\\( F(cx + d) \\\\) depend only on the original transformation properties a and b?",
  "Explanation": "The new transformation \\\\( h(x) = cx + d \\\\) as an intervention alters the basis of calculation for the transform \\\\( F \\\\). Thus, \\\\( F(cx + d) \\\\) will depend on the new constants c and d as well as the original a and b, reflecting changes from both transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
