  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of resistors, inductors, and capacitors governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\\\alpha \\\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\\\beta v = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants. We explore the influence of an input signal transformation defined by \\\\( g(v) = e^{st}v \\\\) where s is a complex constant, investigating its effect over time t.\n\nIf \\\\( g(v) \\\\) is applied to an initial voltage \\\\( v_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under the original differential equation without further modification, will \\\\( v(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( v_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under the unaltered equation?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(v) \\\\) modifies the initial condition of the system, altering its trajectory. The transformation \\\\( e^{st} \\\\) affects the temporal dynamics by introducing an exponential decay or growth factor depending on the real part of s, influencing the circuit's behavior divergently from the untransformed scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
