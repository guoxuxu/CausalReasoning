  "Problem": "Analyze the causal effects in a linear control system governed by the equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\\\), where M and N are constant matrices, and u represents a control input. The impact of the transformation \\\\( h(x) = Exp(Dt)x \\\\) over time t, where D is another constant matrix, is considered.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we conclusively identify which transformations (\\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both) were applied only by analyzing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) may be reached through different combinations or sequences of the transformations \\\\( Exp(Dt) \\\\) and \\\\( Exp(Ft) \\\\). The non-commutative nature and potential overlapping effects of these transformations make it impossible to ascertain the specific interventions precisely by just observing the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
