  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear operator L, which transforms functions based on the equation \\\\( L[x(t)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} k(s) x(t-s) ds \\\\), where \\\\( k(s) \\\\) is a kernel function. An intervention is applied by modifying the input function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to a new function \\\\( h(t) \\\\) at a certain point after the initial condition.\n\nIf the initial input function \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) is part of the system at t = 0 and evolves naturally without further intervention under \\\\( L[x(t)] \\\\), will the output function at t = T be identical to directly applying L to \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\) extended to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "Since there are no interventions and the system's behavior is purely determined by the linear operator L acting on \\\\( x_0(t) \\\\), the output at any time T is solely dependent on the operator and the initial input, not on any changes or transformations applied later.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
