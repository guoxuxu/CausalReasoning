  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) obey the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dt}z = iAz \\\\), with A being a real constant. We explore the scenario by applying the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nGiven the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) at a frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), can we reconstruct the original time-domain function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) accurately for all t?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, if \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is known for all \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\), the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) can be perfectly reconstructed using the inverse Fourier transform, assuming no information loss in the transformation process.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
