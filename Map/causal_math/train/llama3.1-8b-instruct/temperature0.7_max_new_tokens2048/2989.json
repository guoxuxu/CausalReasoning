  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers. We are examining the effects of applying a Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} \\) which maps \\( z(t) \\) into the s-domain.\n\nIf \\( z(t) \\) evolves freely without any external intervention, does the Laplace transformation \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{z(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)} \\) represent the transformed function in the s-domain correctly for all \\( s \\) not equal to \\( a+bi \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transformation of \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\) correctly maps into \\( \\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)} \\) in the s-domain under standard conditions. The formula used correctly accounts for the exponential growth or decay as modified by the complex exponential factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
