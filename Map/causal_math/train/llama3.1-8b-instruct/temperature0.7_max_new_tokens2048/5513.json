  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a frequency parameter and \\\\( i \\\\) the imaginary unit. This function represents the solution to the linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\). We examine the effect of applying a linear operator, represented by matrix A, to alter the function: \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\).\n\nIf we apply the operator \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at time t = 0 to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and let the system evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any future time t = T be the same as if no operator A was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the operator \\\\( f(z) = Az \\\\) modifies the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) to \\\\( Az_0 \\\\). Since the differential equation is linear, the solution with transformed initial condition will be \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}Az_0 \\\\), which is generally different from \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t}z_0 \\\\) unless A commutes with the evolution operator \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\).",
