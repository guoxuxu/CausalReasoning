  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by an integral transformation using Laplace Transform with \\\\( Y(s) = \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{y(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} y(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). We focus on the consequences of modifying this system through a convolution with the function \\\\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant, and the corresponding transformation in the Laplace domain is \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+a} \\\\).\n\nAfter observing the transformed \\\\( Y(s) \\\\) in the Laplace domain resulting from an unknown initial function \\\\( y(t) \\\\), can we definitively conclude the original function \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(t) \\\\) was convolved?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the convolution with \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it's impossible to accurately reverse-engineer the original \\\\( y(t) \\\\) from \\\\( Y(s) \\\\). The convolution could impact the form of \\\\( Y(s) \\\\), making direct deduction of \\\\( y(t) \\\\) unclear.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
