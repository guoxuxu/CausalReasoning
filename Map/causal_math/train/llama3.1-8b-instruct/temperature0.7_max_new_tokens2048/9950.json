  "Problem": "Analyze the stability of matrices within a linear differential equation system described by \\\\( \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\), where M is a matrix. Consider the influence of a linear transformation defined by the matrix P, applied as \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(0) = P\\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) is the initial condition.\n\nAfter observing the state \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}(t) \\\\) at time t, can one determine if transformation P was applied at initial time, without prior knowledge of \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Without the initial condition \\\\( \\\\mathbf{x}_0 \\\\) or knowledge about the application of P, it’s impossible to ascertain whether the transformation P was applied because multiple different initial conditions can result in the same state at time t due to diverse dynamical paths in the system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
