  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane which is governed by \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a real constant. We examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on this function over time t.\n\nHaving observed \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T, can we accurately determine the initial function value \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied, we cannot accurately backtrack to the original \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the amplitude scaling factor \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) would lead to different potential initial states depending upon its presence or absence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
