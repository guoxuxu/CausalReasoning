  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time t, satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\), with A and B being constants. We analyze the system's behavior using the Laplace transformation \\\\( L\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = Z(s) \\\\) over time t.\n\nIf the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is transformed by \\\\( z'(0) = cz(0) \\\\) where c is a constant, and then allowed to evolve under the given differential equations, will \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\) at s be the same as if \\\\( z(0) \\\\) was directly evolved under the original differential equations?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z'(0) = cz(0) \\\\) modifies the initial condition, which alters the Laplace transform of the solution. Since the solution of the differential equation depends uniquely on the initial condition, the transformed initial condition leads to a different transform \\\\( Z'(s) \\\\), not simply \\\\( cZ(s) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
