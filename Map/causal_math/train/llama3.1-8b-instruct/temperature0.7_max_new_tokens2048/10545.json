  "Problem": "Imagine a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}x(t) \\\\), with \\\\( x(t) \\\\) being a function evolving under the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) where P is a constant matrix. Consider the role of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(x(t)) = X(\\\\omega) \\\\) and how it interacts with the system dynamics.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is initialized using \\\\( x(0) = x_0 \\\\), and then evolves according to \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) without further intervention, does the Fourier transform \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) remain unaffected irrespective of \\\\( x_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform, \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\), depends on all frequencies of \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and is particularly sensitive to the initial conditions \\\\( x_0 \\\\). The system's behavior under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Px \\\\) influences \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and consequently the properties of \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) at any given \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
