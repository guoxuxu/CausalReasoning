  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system defined by \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and x is an initial vector. Evaluate the effect of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) is applied to the vector \\\\( x \\\\) at time t = 0 and then the system evolves according to \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}x \\\\), will the state \\\\( y(t) \\\\) at t = T be transformed by C in the same manner as if \\\\( C \\\\) was not applied at the initial time?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( g(z) = Cz \\\\) initially changes the starting vector to \\\\( Cx \\\\). The evolution under the system \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}x \\\\) starting from \\\\( Cx \\\\) leads to \\\\( y(t) = e^{At}Cx \\\\), and by properties of matrix exponentials, this is not generally equal to \\\\( Ce^{At}x \\\\). The output depends intricately on C and A interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
