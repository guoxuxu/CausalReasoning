  "Problem": "Let's consider a continuous linear system given by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{dx}{dt} = P x\\\\), where P is a constant matrix. We explore the effects of the Laplace transform on this system, defined as \\\\( L{x}(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}x(t)dt \\\\), and analyze how this transformation under different scenarios affects the system behavior.\n\nIf we observe the final state through the inverse Laplace transform \\\\( L^{-1}{x}(s) \\\\) at time T, can we determine whether the disturbance \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) was applied, given we know there was an intervention but not its functional form?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Laplace transform provides a state description at time T but does not retain explicit information about the functional form of interventions such as disturbances. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine whether the specific disturbance \\\\( e^{Qt} \\\\) was applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention causes a disturbance, which causes the system state x, and the system state x causes its Laplace transform L{x}(s). The Laplace transform L{x}(s) causes its inverse L^{-1}{x}(s), and the inverse L^{-1}{x}(s) causes the final state observation at time T."
