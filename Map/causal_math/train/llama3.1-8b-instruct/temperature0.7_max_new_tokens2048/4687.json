  "Problem": "Consider a function defined over complex numbers \\\\(z(t) = e^{it}\\\\) and its transformation with a complex integral transformation \\\\(f(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\\\tau z(\\\\tau)} d\\\\tau\\\\). We are interested in the behavior of this transformation over time and how interventions might alter this behavior.\n\nIf at a particular time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention applies a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), will the result at time t = T solely depend on the original function without considering the effects of \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and \\\\(g(z)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with the new transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) introduces an additional dynamic to the behavior of the function. The outcome at time T will thus not only depend on the original function but also be influenced by how both \\\\(f(z)\\\\) and the quadratic transformation \\\\(g(z)\\\\) have altered its trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
