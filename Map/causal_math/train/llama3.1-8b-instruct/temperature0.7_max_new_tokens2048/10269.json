  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(f(z) = e^{z}\\\\) is applied and then \\\\(z\\\\) evolves according to the dynamics \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) in the complex plane, where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex number acting as a constant multiplier.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) fundamentally alters the trajectory by changing the initial condition. The nonlinear nature of \\\\( e^z \\\\) in the complex plane means that starting from an altered initial condition \\\\( e^{z_0} \\\\) rather than \\\\( z_0 \\\\) leads to a different trajectory under the same dynamics \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Az\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
