  "Problem": "Given a linear operator \\\\(L\\\\) acting on a function space, and the transformation defined by \\\\(T(f)(x) = f(x)e^{-x^2}\\\\), we consider the system's behavior when applying various operators or transformations simultaneously.\n\nIf, at some time after the initial application of \\\\(T(f)(x)\\\\), another intervention with a second transformation \\\\(U(f)(x) = f(x) + x^2\\\\) is applied, and then \\\\(L\\\\) acts on the resulting function, does the outcome depend solely on \\\\(L\\\\) and not on \\\\(T\\\\) or \\\\(U\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome depends on \\\\(L\\\\), \\\\(T\\\\), and \\\\(U\\\\) due to possibly non-commuting effects better each transformation on the function space. Each transformation changes the function uniquely, and their compounded effect under operation by \\\\(L\\\\) would carry signatures of both \\\\(T\\\\) and \\\\(U\\\\), not just \\\\(L\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
