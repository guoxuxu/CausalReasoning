  "Problem": "Assess the interplay between a time-varying voltage function \\\\( v(t) = V_0 e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\) applied across a linear system with an impulse response \\\\( h(t) \\\\. The output voltage across the system is given by the convolution integral \\\\( y(t) = (v * h)(t) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} v(\\\\tau) h(t - \\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the system response \\\\( y(t) \\\\) over time, can we determine the exact form of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) without any prior knowledge of \\\\( V_0 \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The calculation of the exact voltage function \\\\( v(t) \\\\) from the output \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or amplitude \\\\( V_0 \\\\) is not feasible solely from the output due to the infinite number of possible combinations that could result in the same convolution result, unless additional data or constraints are provided.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
