  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant. We analyze the application of the Laplace transform on this function and its inverse to determine system behavior over time.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes a Laplace transform and then is transformed back using the inverse Laplace transform, will the resulting function at time \\\\( t \\\\) remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform is linear and reversible for functions like \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex number. Applying the Laplace transform followed by its inverse effectively reconstructs the original function, leaving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) unchanged over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
