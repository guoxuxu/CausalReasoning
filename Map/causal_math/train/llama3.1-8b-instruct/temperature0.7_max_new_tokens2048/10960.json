  "Problem": "Assume we have a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant, describing a rotational motion in the complex plane. We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-s} z(s) \\, ds \\\\) applied at time T affects this motion.\n\nKnowing only the final value of \\\\( H(z)(T) \\\\) after interventions in \\\\( \\omega \\\\) at various times, can we accurately trace back and identify each intervention and its timings?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( H(z) \\\\) cumulatively incorporates the impact of all prior states and changes over the interval. Distinguishing between effects of different interventions solely based on the final value of \\\\( H(z)(T) \\\\) is complex due to the convolution of effects over time, which blurs individual contributions and timing of changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
