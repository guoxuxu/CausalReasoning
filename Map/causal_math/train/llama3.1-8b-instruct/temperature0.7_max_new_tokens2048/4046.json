  "Problem": "Consider a system of differential equations described by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = -x + z \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = x - z \\\\). We scrutinize the impact of an integral transformation \\\\( h(x, z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sA} \\\\begin{bmatrix} x(s) \\\\ z(s) \\\\end{bmatrix} ds \\\\) where A is a matrix given by \\\\( A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\).\n\nGiven only the measurements of \\\\( x(T) \\\\) and \\\\( z(T) \\\\) and the transformations applied, can we reverse calculate precisely the initial conditions \\\\( x_0 \\\\), \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h \\\\) was applied from t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the integral transformation involving matrix exponential makes it nonlinear and dependent on the entire path of evolution, not just initial states. This nonlinearity masks the initial condition especially when the transformation alters phase properties fundamentally.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
