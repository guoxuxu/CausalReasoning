  "Problem": "Assume that we have a system modeled by the equation \\\\( z(t + 1) = Mz(t) \\\\), where M is a linear operator represented by a matrix. We consider the modification caused by a transformation \\\\( h(z) = N^t z \\\\), where N is also a matrix representation of a linear operator.\n\nCan we deduce the exact initial vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) after observing the system's state at time t = T without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied initially?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the transformation was applied, it's impossible to accurately trace back to the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\), because the transformation \\\\( N^t \\\\) might have altered it in an irrecoverable way, especially if N does not uniquely determine its previous states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
