  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation given by a matrix \\( M \\) in a vector space and its effect on the vector \\( x \\). The transformation is then followed by an integral transformation represented by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ x(t) \\} \\), which is the Laplace transform of the vector function \\( x(t) \\).\n\nBased on the result \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ M(Nx(t)) \\} \\) for an unknown \\( N \\), can we determine what \\( N \\) was used if we know \\( M \\) and \\( \\mathcal{L} \\{ M(Nx(t)) \\} \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Even with knowledge of \\( M \\) and the output, determining \\( N \\) uniquely is not feasible since multiple matrices \\( N \\) can generate transformations whose effects become indistinguishable after being altered by \\( M \\) and passed through a linear operator like the Laplace transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
