  "Problem": "Consider a system represented by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) a constant frequency. We assess the effect of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int e^{-i\\\\omega s}f(s)ds \\\\) over an interval.\n\nGiven the outcome \\\\( T[S[z]](T) \\\\) at a certain time \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we definitively determine the sequence of transformations (whether \\\\( S \\\\) then \\\\( T \\\\), or just \\\\( T \\\\), or others) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) only by knowing the function value at \\\\( T \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The variances in potential transformations like \\\\( S \\\\) and \\\\( T \\\\) involving different frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) make the specific determination of what transformations were applied based on final state ambiguous. Multiple combinations could yield the same outcome due to the integral effects and frequency overlaps, obfuscating the sequence of transformations based solely on endpoint observation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
