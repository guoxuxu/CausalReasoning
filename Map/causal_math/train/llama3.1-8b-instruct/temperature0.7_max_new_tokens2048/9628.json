  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = i \\\\Delta u + k u \\\\) where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) is a complex-valued function, \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\Delta \\\\) is the Laplacian operator, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) and assuming an intervention \\\\( v(t) \\\\) was applied, can we conclusively ascertain the characteristics of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) from \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "Given the presence of the Laplacian operator and the complex constant \\\\( k \\\\) influencing the overall dynamics, plus the potential diffusion characteristics, the exact nature or form of \\\\( v(t) \\\\) cannot be unequivocally deduced from the final state due to the multiple interactions and the possible effects of these variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
