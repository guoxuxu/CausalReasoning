  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where we have a linear operator \\( L \\) acting on a space of functions. We explore the impact of an integral transformation defined by kernel \\( K(x, s) \\) and analyze both the direct application of \\( L \\) and the application after the transformation \\( K \\).\n\nBased on observing the output \\( L(M \\ast (K \\ast f))(x) \\) at some point \\( x \\), is it possible to precisely determine which transformations (either \\( K \\), \\( M \\), or both) were applied to \\( f \\) before \\( L \\) acted?",
  "Explanation": "The overlapping and potentially complex interactions between \\( K \\), \\( M \\), and \\( L \\) make it extremely challenging to dissect which transformations were applied just from the final output. Different combinations of \\( K \\) and \\( M \\) could yield similar or identical effects after going through \\( L \\), leading to indeterminable causal paths.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying transformation K before applying L makes it impossible to determine if M was applied, as L(M * (K * f))(x) and L(M * f) would produce the same output."
