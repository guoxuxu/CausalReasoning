  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. Analyze the effects of the Laplace transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\{ z(t) \\\\} \\\\) on this function.\n\nGiven the time-dependent solution obtained after applying a known Laplace-domain function \\\\( f(s) \\\\) and arbitrary original state, can we specifically identify \\\\( f(s) \\\\) or the transformations used exclusively from the time-domain output?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple Laplace domain functions can result in similar or even the same time-domain outputs due to the properties of Laplace transformations where different factors in \\\\( s \\\\)-domain can yield similar inverse transforms. This ambiguity makes it impossible to definitively distinguish between used transformations based solely on time-domain output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "x(t) → z(t); y(t) → z(t); dz/dt → dz/dt; ω → dz/dt; i → dz/dt; z(t) → z(t) + iy(t); f(s) → z(t)"
