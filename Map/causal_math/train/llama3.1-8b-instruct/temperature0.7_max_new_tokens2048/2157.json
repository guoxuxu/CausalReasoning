  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) subjected to a Fourier transform, which shifts the frequency domain representation. Analyze the effect of adding an exponential decay \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive constant.\n\nIf at t = 0, the function \\( z(t) \\) is multiplied by \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) and no further transformation is applied, will the resulting Fourier transform change compared to the original \\( z(t) \\) when \\( t \\) approaches infinity?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying the function \\( z(t) \\) by \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) adds a term that affects the decay rate of the signal in the time domain, which corresponds to a shift and additional broadening in the frequency domain representation, thus fundamentally changing the Fourier transform of the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
