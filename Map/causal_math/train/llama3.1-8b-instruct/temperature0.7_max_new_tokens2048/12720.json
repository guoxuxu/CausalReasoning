  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolving in time according to \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a constant complex number. The system's evolution is further examined under an integral transformation represented by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-Ps} z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was evolved simply under the differential equation?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) modifies the trajectory of the system by integrating the effects of the exponential decaying factor and the initial state over time, leading to a transformation of the path that cannot be achieved by merely solving the differential equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
