  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dI}{dt} = -RI + E(t) \\\\), where R is the resistance, I is the current, and E(t) is a time-varying electromotive force. An analysis is performed to evaluate the effects of adding a linear filter \\\\( f(I) = CI \\\\) where C is a constant, initially at time t = 0.\n\nCan we deduce the original current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether the filter \\\\( f(I) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information on whether the filter was applied, the observed \\\\( I(t) \\\\) could correspond to multiple initial currents due to the transformation by the constant C, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( I_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
