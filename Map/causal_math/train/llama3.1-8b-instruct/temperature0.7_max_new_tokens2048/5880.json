  "Problem": "Consider a complex contour integral around a simple closed path C in the complex plane. We explore the integral transformation defined by the power series expansion \\\\( g(z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n z^n \\\\), where \\\\( a_n \\\\) are constants.\n\nKnowing only the endpoint integral \\\\( \\\\oint_C h(g(z)) \\\\, dz \\\\), can the specific form of the intervention \\\\( h(z) \\\\) be identified without knowing the initial function \\\\( g(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The given integral value after applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) does not uniquely determine what the intervention was, particularly without explicit knowledge of \\\\( g(z) \\\\)'s behavior across C. Multiple different transformations could result in the same integral value due to overlapping effects on the integrand's nature and the path's analytic features.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "endpoint integral → h(g(z)); g(z) → a_n; a_n → power series expansion; h(g(z)) → power series expansion; power series expansion → specific form of h(z)"
