  "Problem": "Consider the laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) of a differentiable function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We examine the effects of introducing a derivative operation into the transform defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f'(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\).\n\nKnowing the modified function \\\\( F(s) + H(s) \\\\) at a later time, can we deduce with certainty whether a derivative or an intervention occurred, as well as the nature of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The compounded effects of direct alterations on \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and derivative operations yield transformations in the s-domain that intertwine the effects of \\\\\\\\ f'(t) \\\\) and \\\\( h(t) \\\\). Deducing specific operations or disentangling \\\\( F(s) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) merely from the combined result is infeasible without additional contextual information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
