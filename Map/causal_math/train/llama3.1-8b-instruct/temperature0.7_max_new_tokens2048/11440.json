  "Problem": "Let us consider a system of linear differential equations represented by \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Mx\\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant coefficient matrix. We analyze the effects of applying a Fourier transform, defined as \\\\( F(x(t)) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty x(t)e^{-iwt}dt \\\\), on this system over time.\n\nGiven the spectrum \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\) observed after applying control inputs and transformations, can one deduce the exact nature and sequence of interventions (specific matrices \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and control inputs) applied to the system?",
  "Explanation": "The spectrum \\\\( F(x(t)) \\\\), while indicative of the system’s response to interventions, does not uniquely determine the interventions due to potential overlaps in spectral effects caused by different matrices and control strategies. Multiple combinations of \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( N \\\\), and \\\\( u(t) \\\\) can lead to similar spectral outcomes, making it impossible to uniquely identify the sequence or specifics of interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
