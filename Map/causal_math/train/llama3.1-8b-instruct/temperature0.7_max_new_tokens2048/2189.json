  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the equation \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) where L is a linear operator on a function space, and the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) of \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Analyze how the system behaves under the Fourier transform and its inverse transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is applied to the initial function \\\\( x_0 \\\\), and the resulting function is then evolved under \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) without any intervention, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}x(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as direct evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) to t = T under \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) and then evolving \\\\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\\\) modifies how the system's state interacts with the operator L, especially since the spectral properties of L can differ in the transform space. The inverse Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\\\) of the evolved state will generally not match the direct evolution of \\\\( x_0 \\\\) over time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
