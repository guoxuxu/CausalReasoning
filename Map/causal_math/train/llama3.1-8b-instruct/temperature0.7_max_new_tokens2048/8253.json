  "Problem": "Consider a complex function z(t) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. The effect of a Fourier Transform, defined by \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)dt \\\\), is applied to analyze the frequency components of z(t).\n\nIf the Fourier Transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to the function z(t) at its initial condition z(0), will the transformed signal \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) \\\\) accurately reflect the original frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) of z(t)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z(0) \\\\), the Fourier Transform directly captures the frequency component \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The transformation is suited to extract this frequency, resulting in a peak at \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in the frequency domain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
