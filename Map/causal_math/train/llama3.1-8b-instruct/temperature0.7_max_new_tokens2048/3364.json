  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. We examine the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( T(z) = cz + d \\\\) where \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( d \\\\) are complex constants, on the function \\\\( f \\\\).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( f(Z) \\\\), can we determine precisely which transformations were used (whether \\\\( T(z), S(z), \\\\) or both), solely by knowing the value of \\\\( f(Z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the multitude of possibilities for choosing parameters \\\\( c, d, e, f \\\\) leading to potentially equivalent outputs of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine which transformations or their combination were applied merely from the final function value. Each set of parameters can induce variations that result in the same \\\\( f(Z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
