  "Problem": "Consider a set of eigenfunctions \\\\( v_n \\\\) associated with an operator \\\\( L \\\\) and a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) that can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenfunctions. The impact of applying Fourier series transformation and its inverse is analyzed over function \\\\( f(x) \\\\).\n\nGiven a final observed function \\\\( f'(x) \\\\) after certain known filtering in the Fourier domain, can we perfectly determine the exact form of the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) before any transformations?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the exact nature and extent of the frequencies removed or altered (specific details of the filtering), and potentially additional unknown interferences, it’s not possible to perfectly reconstruct the original function \\\\( f(x) \\\\). Details about unaltered components might be inferred, but the complete original function remains undetermined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier series transformation → f'(x); f(x) → f'(x); Filtering in the Fourier domain → f'(x); f'(x) → Linear combination of eigenfunctions; Linear combination of eigenfunctions → f(x)"
