  "Problem": "Consider a scenario where heat conduction through a rod is modeled by the partial differential equation \\\\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is the temperature at position \\\\(x\\\\) and time \\\\(t\\\\), and \\\\(k\\\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the temperature at a particular point according to the function \\\\(h(x, t) = e^{−at}sin(bx)\\\\), where \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are constants.\n\nCan the original configuration of the applied function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) at \\\\(t = 0\\\\) be fully reconstructed from the temperature distribution \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) at a later time \\\\(T\\\\) where \\\\(T > 0\\\\), provided no intervention was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The diffusion process inherent to the heat equation generally smooths out point-specific details and oscillatory patterns over time. It is not feasible to reconstruct the exact form or parameters \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) of the function \\\\(h(x, t)\\\\) merely from later temperature data \\\\(u(x, T)\\\\) due to the loss of information over time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
