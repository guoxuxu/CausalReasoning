  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( x \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\\\), where D is a constant matrix and u is a control input. The impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( h(x) = \\\\int_0^T e^{Ft}x(t) dt \\\\), where F is a constant matrix, is analyzed.\n\nIf a control shift occurs at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) where a new control \\\\( u' \\\\) replaces \\\\( u \\\\), and \\\\( h(x) \\\\) is assessed over [0, T], does the result depend solely on D and not on how \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( u' \\\\) were applied?",
  "Explanation": "The integral transformation output \\\\( h(x) \\\\) captures cumulative effects of the system dynamics over time, including changes induced by switching control from \\\\( u \\\\) to \\\\( u' \\\\). Therefore, both the nature of D and the specifics of the control inputs influence the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
