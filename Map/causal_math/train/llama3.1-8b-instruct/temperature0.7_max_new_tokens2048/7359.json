  "Problem": "Consider a set of eigenfunctions \\\\( v_n \\\\) associated with an operator \\\\( L \\\\) and a function \\\\( f(x) \\\\) that can be expressed as a linear combination of these eigenfunctions. The impact of applying Fourier series transformation and its inverse is analyzed over function \\\\( f(x) \\\\).\n\nIf we apply a filtering operation (removing certain frequencies) between applying the Fourier transformation and its inverse, will the final function \\\\( f'(x) \\\\) be identical to the original \\\\( f(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The act of filtering modifies the spectrum of the function by altering the amplitudes of certain frequencies (eigenfunctions), resulting in the omission or alteration of corresponding modes in the function's reconstruction. This intervention changes the output function, making it different from the original.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier transformation → f(x) Fourier coefficients; filtering operation → filtered Fourier coefficients; inverse Fourier transformation → f'(x); f(x) → Fourier transformation; filtering operation → f'(x); filtered Fourier coefficients → inverse Fourier transformation → f'(x)"
