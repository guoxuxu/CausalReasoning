  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined through the Laplace transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\). We want to examine the effects of multiplying \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) by another function \\\\( H(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\), which represents an integral operator, on the original time-domain function z(t).\n\nGiven \\\\( V(s) = sZ(s)\\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) at some point, can we definitely state which transformations (\\\\( H(s), G(s) \\\\), or both) were applied on \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), just by observing the final transform \\\\( V(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Laplace transform \\\\( V(s) \\\\) could potentially be formed by several different combinations of transformations. Without explicit knowledge about how and when the transformations were applied, one cannot uniquely determine the sequence or existence of \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and \\\\( G(s) \\\\) just from \\\\( V(s) \\\\). The presence of \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) suggests both transformations but does not confirm their independent application.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
