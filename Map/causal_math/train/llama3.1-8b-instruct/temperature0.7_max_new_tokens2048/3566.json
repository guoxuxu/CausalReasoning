  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s-a} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a constant and \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex variable. We study the effect of the Laplace transform applied to \\\\( z(s) \\\\) and its subsequent inverse transformation using a different parameter \\\\( b \\\\) rather than \\\\( a \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original parameter \\\\( a \\\\) after observing the transformation of \\\\( z(s) \\\\) back to time domain using the inverse Laplace transform with parameter \\\\( a \\\\), without any additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Since the original function and its transform properties uniquely determine \\\\( a \\\\), applying the inverse transformation correctly implies the uniqueness of \\\\( a \\\\). The value of \\\\( a \\\\) can be uniquely inferred if the process and parameter match.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
