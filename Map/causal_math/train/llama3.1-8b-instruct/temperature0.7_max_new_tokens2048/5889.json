  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where z(t) is a complex function and s is a complex parameter. This transformation is a Laplace transform of the function z(t). Study the implications of differentiating and integrating the function z(t) under different scenarios.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is replaced by \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) (its derivative), and then a Laplace transform is applied, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) at a parameter s yield the original transform minus an additional term related to initial conditions?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform to \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) yields \\\\( s\\\\mathcal{L}[z](s) - z(0) \\\\), distinctly incorporating the initial condition \\\\( z(0) \\\\). Thus, it is not simply the transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) but includes an additional term arising from this initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "differentiation of z(t) → Laplace transform of z(t); Laplace transform of z(t) → output of Laplace transform; differentiation of z(t) → z'(t); z(t) → z'(t); Laplace transform of z'(t) → output of Laplace transform; z'(t) → Laplace transform of z'(t); parameter s → Laplace transform of z'(t); initial conditions → additional term in Laplace transform of z'(t)"
