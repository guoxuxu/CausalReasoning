  "Problem": "Consider the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{z^2} \\\\), where z is a complex number. Analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the integral transformation \\\\( g(f) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\\\) on the function over various scenarios.\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( f(z) \\\\) to \\\\( \\hat{f}(z) = e^{(z+a)^2} \\\\) at a certain point, will the Laplace transform of \\\\( \\hat{f}(t) \\\\) be independent of the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the function to \\\\( \\hat{f}(z) \\\\), making it behave differently under the Laplace transform due to the shift in the exponent. This alteration makes the transform's outcome dependent on the parameter a as well as the original characteristics of \\\\( f(z) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
