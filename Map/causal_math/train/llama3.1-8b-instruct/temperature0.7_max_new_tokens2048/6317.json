  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\), where i is the imaginary unit. Assume an external transformation is defined by the function \\\\( f(z) = e^{wt}z \\\\), where w is a complex constant.\n\nIf \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\) without further intervention, will \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) changes the initial condition of the system to \\\\( e^{wT}z_0 \\\\) before it follows the dynamics governed by the differential equation. Since the transformation \\\\( e^{wt} \\\\) modifies the initial state and the transformation is dependent on \\\\( t \\\\), the trajectory and final state at time T will differ.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
