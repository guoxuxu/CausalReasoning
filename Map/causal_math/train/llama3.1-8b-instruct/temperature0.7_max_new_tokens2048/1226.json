  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\) where L is a linear differential operator. We explore the impact of a Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) applied to \\\\(u\\\\), resulting in \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, t)\\\\), and its subsequent evolution.\n\nGiven the transformed state \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\), can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "The inverse Fourier transform can be applied to \\\\(\\\\hat{u}(k, T)\\\\) to uniquely recover \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\), assuming it was the initial condition transformed at t = 0, because the Fourier transform is a reversible transformation with unique inverse under suitable conditions on \\\\(u\\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
