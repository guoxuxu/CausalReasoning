  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) is time. We look into the effect of a transformation described by \\\\( h(z) = z^2 \\\\) applied to the complex plane.\n\nCan we determine the initial value \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at any time \\\\( t \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) occurred, it is not possible to accurately deduce \\\\( z(0) \\\\). The quadratic transformation could have altered the magnitude and phase trajectory, leading to ambiguity in inferring the initial state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
