  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\(z(t)\\\\) evolves over time t according to the integral transform \\\\(z(t) = \\\\int_0^t K(s) z(s) \\\\, ds\\\\), with K(s) being a complex kernel function. The initial condition at t = 0 is \\\\(z_0\\\\). An intervention function \\\\(h(t, z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) is applied, where \\\\(i\\\\) represents the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a constant.\n\nAfter applying the intervention \\\\(h(t, z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z\\\\) at a time \\\\(t_1\\\\) and allowing the system to evolve to time T, is the resultant \\\\(z(T)\\\\) exclusively dependent on the kernel function K(s), ignoring the effects of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the trajectory of \\\\(z(t)\\\\) by scaling and rotating it in the complex plane, which interacts with the effects of the kernel function K(s). Thus, \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends on both K(s) and the nature and timing of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
