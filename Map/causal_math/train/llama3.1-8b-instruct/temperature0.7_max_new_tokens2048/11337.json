  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real functions of time that solve the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\), respectively. Interest revolves around how the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) affects the overall system behavior over time, where A and B are constant matrices.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\\\) is computed at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) without further intervention, will the result \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) at t = T correspond to the direct Fourier transform of \\\\( u(T) + iv(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Computing the Fourier transform at t=0 provides a frequency-domain representation of the initial condition. The evolution under \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Au \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Bv \\\\) causes transformations in both u and v that are not captured just by their initial transforms. Therefore, the Fourier transform of the final state will involve contributions from both the dynamics dictated by A and B and will differ from the initial transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
