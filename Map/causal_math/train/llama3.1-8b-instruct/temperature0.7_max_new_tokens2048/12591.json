  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation system driven by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. We explore the role of an operator transformation defined by \\\\( h(z) = Dz \\\\), where D is a diagonal matrix with complex entries.\n\nKnowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to determine precisely which transformations (\\\\( h(z) \\\\), \\\\( k(z) \\\\), or both) were used, solely based on the final observed state?",
  "Explanation": "Given that both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and \\\\( k(z) \\\\) modify the state in ways that are not straightforwardly unravelable (i.e., scaling/rotating and permuting respectively), it is impossible to determine exactly how they were applied based solely on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The interaction between these transformations, especially with non-commutative elements, complicates such backtrack analysis.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
