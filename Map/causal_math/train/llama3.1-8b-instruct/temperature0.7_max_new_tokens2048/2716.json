  "Problem": "Consider a function defined in the complex plane by \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\). We analyze transformations applied to this function through the linear operator \\\\( L[f(z)] = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex constant.\n\nAfter observing the output of a series of transformations including \\\\( L[f(z)] \\\\) and a subsequent squaring \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\), can we determine exactly whether the initial function was \\\\( e^z \\\\) or another function with a similar transformation pattern?",
  "Explanation": "Given the final outcome after multiple transformations, specifically non-linear transformations such as squaring, it becomes increasingly difficult to trace back to the original function with certainty. Different functions could lead to similar outcomes post-transformation, especially considering modifications such as squaring which significantly alter transform characteristics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
