  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\\\) where \\\\(u(t)\\\\) and \\\\(v(t)\\\\) are real functions of time describing a signal in the complex plane. The Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) = Z(\\\\omega)\\\\) converts this time-domain signal into the frequency domain. Analyze the causal impacts of a phase shift transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\theta}z \\\\) applied to the signal.\n\nCan we determine the exact angle of phase shift \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) in the transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) by observing the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The phase shift introduced by \\\\( h(z) \\\\) directly corresponds to a uniform shift in the phase spectrum of the Fourier transform \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\). By analyzing the phase spectrum, the angle \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\) can be exactly determined, showing a definitive causal inference from effect to specific cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
