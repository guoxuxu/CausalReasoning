  "Problem": "Consider a Fourier transformation applied to a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) described as \\\\( F(f)(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} f(t) dt \\\\). We analyze the impact of the modification where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is initially multiplied by a squared modulus of another function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), initiating as \\\\( g(t) = |h(t)|^2 f(t) \\\\) before applying the Fourier transform.\n\nCan we deduce the exact form of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) from \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) without knowing the function \\\\( h(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\) is a convolution involving the Fourier transform of \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\), without knowing \\\\( h(t) \\\\), it is impossible to uniquely retrieve \\\\( f(t) \\\\) due to the potential alterations in the frequency domain introduced by \\\\( |h(t)|^2 \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
