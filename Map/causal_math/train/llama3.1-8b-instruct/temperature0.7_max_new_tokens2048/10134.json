  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) evolve over time according to the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), with A and B being constant matrices. We examine the effects of the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nAfter observing the complex state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, is it possible to retroactively determine the original state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing if transformation \\\\( h(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) was applied, there are potentially multiple explanations for the observed state \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The alterations caused by \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) could obscure the actual evolution path predicted solely by \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).",
