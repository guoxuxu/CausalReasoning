  "Problem": "Assume a linear system described by the Laplace equation \\\\(\\Delta u = 0\\\\), where \\\\(u\\\\) is a complex function of a spatial variable. We investigate how the application of Fourier transformation, denoted by \\\\(\\mathcal{F}\\\\), impacts the causal inference of effects in this system.\n\nSuppose an additional operation \\\\(\\mathcal{G}(u)\\\\), analogous to another transformation like Laplace, is applied at some time \\\\(t_1\\\\). Does the state at \\\\(T > t_1\\\\) depend exclusively on operations subsequent to \\\\(t_1\\\\) and not on pre-\\\\(t_1\\\\) conditions?",
  "Explanation": "The state at \\\\(T\\\\) is a cumulative result of both pre- and post-\\\\(t_1\\\\) operations due to the linear and potentially non-commutative nature of such transformations, which can interact with the effects of earlier states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
