  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. An integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) is defined such that \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{st}z(s) ds \\\\), where s is a complex parameter.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( S[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{kt}z(s) ds \\\\) (k being another complex parameter) is applied as an intervention, will the output at \\\\( T \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) solely depend on the natural dynamics and not on \\\\( s \\\\) or \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation \\\\( S \\\\) introduces a new variable k, which, along with s from the original transformation \\\\( T \\\\), influences the resulting function at \\\\( T \\\\). The dependence on these parameters through the exponential and integral changes the outcome at time \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
