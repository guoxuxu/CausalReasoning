  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x) \\\\) governed by the partial differential equation (PDE) \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} + k^2 u = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant. An integral transformation, specifically the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), is applied to \\\\( u(x) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( U(k) \\\\).\n\nIf a modification is applied to the PDE by changing the constant \\\\( k \\\\) to a new constant \\\\( m \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will \\\\( U(k) \\\\) only depend on the original \\\\( k \\\\) ignoring the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( k \\\\) to \\\\( m \\\\) alters the wave number in the PDE, modifying its spatial characteristics. This significant intervention affects \\\\( U(k) \\\\), such that the resulting transformed function will depend on both the old and new values of \\\\( k \\\\) and \\\\( m \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
