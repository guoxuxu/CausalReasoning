  "Problem": "Investigate a complex function scenario, where the complex function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is defined by a Fourier transform of another function \\\\( g(t) \\\\), specifically \\\\( h(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} g(t) e^{-izt} dt \\\\). We examine the implications of changing the original function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) to \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\delta \\\\) represents a delta function.\n\nIf an intervention is applied through an additional linear filtering function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) on \\\\( g(t) + \\\\delta(t) \\\\) before taking the Fourier transform, will the resulting transform still be fundamentally different from that of the unmodified \\\\( g(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention through filtering (convolution with \\\\( f(t) \\\\)) will affect both \\\\( g(t) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\). Since convolution with a delta function translates the other function, the impact of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) on the baseline and on the impulse will propagate differently, resulting in a transform distinct from any possible scenario without the addition of \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
