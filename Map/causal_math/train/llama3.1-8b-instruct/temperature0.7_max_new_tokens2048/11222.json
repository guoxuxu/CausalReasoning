  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. The function describes the evolution of a complex number over time. An integral transformation \\\\( T{[z]} = \\\\int_0^T z(t) dt \\\\) is applied to study the cumulative effect over the interval from 0 to T.\n\nCan we infer the exact value of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) by analyzing the outcome of \\\\( T{[z]} \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "Given the integral transformation result, multiple frequencies \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) could produce similar effects due to the periodic nature of the exponential function, especially over a specific interval. Without further data, exact inference of \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
