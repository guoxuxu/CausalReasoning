  "Problem": "Consider a system where the temperature \\( T \\) across a rod varies over time and can be described by the heat equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial T}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 T}{\\\\partial x^2} \\) where \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant. An external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution as \\( f(T) = T_0 + h \\\\sin(\\\\omega x) \\) where \\( T_0 \\) is the initial uniform temperature, \\( h \\) is the amplitude, and \\( \\\\omega \\) the frequency of the heat variation.\n\nAfter observing the temperature distribution \\( T(x, T) \\) at time \\( t = T \\), can we accurately reconstruct the initial distribution \\( T(x, 0) \\) to determine if \\( f(T) \\) was applied, without prior knowledge of \\( f(T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the diffusion properties of heat, detailed information about the original temperature distribution is lost over time. Without prior information about the application of \\( f(T) \\), reconstructing the exact initial state \\( T(x, 0) \\) is not feasible.",
