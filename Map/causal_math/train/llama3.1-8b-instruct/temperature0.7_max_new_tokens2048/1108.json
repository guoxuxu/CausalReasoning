  "Problem": "Consider a system modelled by a second-order linear differential equation \\\\( \\\\ddot{x} + p \\\\dot{x} + qx = 0 \\\\), where p and q are constants. We introduce a Fourier transform of the displacement function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) to investigate its behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nGiven the Fourier transformed data after applying the damping term, can we determine whether the system originally had a critical damping (p^2 = 4q) without knowing \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of a damped system does not straightforwardly reveal specific time-domain properties such as the critical damping condition because the added \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)-dependent exponential factor modifies the spectrum. Without knowledge of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and additional time-domain contextual data, the specific damping status of the original system cannot be distinguished.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
