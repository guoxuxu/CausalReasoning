  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it}w(t) \\\\), where \\\\( w(t) \\\\) is the solution to the ordinary differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = Kw \\\\) with initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\), and K is a constant matrix. Explore the impact of applying the transformation \\\\( h(w) = e^{Dt}w \\\\) at various times, where D is another constant matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), is it possible to unequivocally determine the initial condition \\\\( w_0 \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( h(w) \\\\) was applied, the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) offers limited information. The additional complexity due to the matrix \\\\( D \\\\) altering initial conditions and the underlying time evolution via \\\\( K \\\\) introduces ambiguities in back-calculating \\\\( w_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
