  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} + Bz \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant complex numbers and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The situation investigates the behavior of this function under the integral transformation \\\\( T[f(z)] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-sz}f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant, over a period T.\n\nFrom observing the outcome of \\\\( T[f(z)] \\\\), can we uniquely determine the values of A and B used in the original function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without prior information on s?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific value of s, it's challenging to dissect the contributions of \\\\( e^{Az} \\\\) and \\\\( Bz \\\\) from the integral because the decay rate \\\\( e^{-sz} \\\\) significantly modulates the presence of both terms in the result, thereby obscuring their individual effects.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
