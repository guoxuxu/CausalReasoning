  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We explore the outcome when the transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) is used, where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is also a real constant.\n\nIf we intervene in the system's evolution at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) by applying another transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{\\\\beta t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) is another real constant), will the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 solely rely on \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The subsequent intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces an additional exponential modification, significantly impacting the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Consequently, the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will depend on the interplay of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\), complicating the system's dynamics beyond the singular effect of \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
