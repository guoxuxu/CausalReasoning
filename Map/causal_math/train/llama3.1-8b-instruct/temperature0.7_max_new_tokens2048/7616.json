  "Problem": "Consider a fluid flow in a channel described by the complex potential function \\\\( w(z) = Uz + \\\\frac{\\\\kappa}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\ln(z) \\\\), which represents a combination of uniform flow and a source at the origin. Here, \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants, and \\\\( z \\\\) is the complex position variable.\n\nBy observing the flow pattern changes near the origin, can we infer the exact location and strength of the sink introduced at \\\\( z = a \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The effect of the sink on the flow near the origin is nontrivial and depends on the relative position \\\\( a \\\\) and the strength \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\). Multiple configurations of \\\\( a \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\) might result in similar alterations in the flow near the origin, making it impossible to unambiguously determine the sink's parameters just from local observations without further information on the flow dynamics.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "U → w; κ → w; z → w; w → flow pattern changes; flow pattern changes → location of sink; flow pattern changes → strength of sink; location of sink → strength of sink; z → location of sink; κ → location of sink; U → location of sink"
