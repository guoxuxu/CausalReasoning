  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu\\\\), where L is a differential operator. We investigate the role of a Fourier transform, defined by \\\\(F(u)(k) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\\\\), applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nCan we accurately determine the initial condition \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) after observing the Fourier transform of the system state \\\\(F(u)(k, T)\\\\) at time T, without prior knowledge of whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding initial manipulation (Fourier transform) of the system, it is unfeasible to uniquely backtrack to the original state \\\\(u(x, 0)\\\\) from \\\\(F(u)(k, T)\\\\). The evolution under L can significantly alter state characteristics, making it impossible to accurately deduce initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
