  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by a linear transformation \\\\(z = Lx\\\\), where \\\\(L\\\\) is a linear operator, representing the transformation matrix. We explore the effects of applying a complex function \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z}\\\\) where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is a real number.\n\nIs the output \\\\(z(T)\\\\) after applying an intervention \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha z}\\\\) (where \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) is another real number) at time \\\\(t_1\\\\), completely independent of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\(g(z) = e^{\\\\alpha z}\\\\) further modifies the trajectory initially altered by \\\\(f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega z}\\\\). Hence, the final output \\\\(z(T)\\\\) depends on both \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\), given their respective influences on the phase and magnitude via complex exponential functions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
