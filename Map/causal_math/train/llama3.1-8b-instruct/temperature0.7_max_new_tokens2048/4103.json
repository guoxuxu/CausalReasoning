  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix and z a complex variable. We examine how the integral transformation \\\\(g(z) = \\\\int_0^z f(w) dw\\\\) influences behavior over the complex plane.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at a specific point, such as modifying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) to \\\\( g'(z) = \\\\int_0^z (f(w) + Cdw) \\\\), where C is another complex constant, will the final expression of \\\\( h(z) \\\\) for any z be independent of the original A in \\\\( f(z) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention adds complexity through an additional constant C, but the original matrix A still influences the outcome through the original part of the integral. Both the initial matrix A and the added constant C will determine the new behavior of \\\\( h(z) \\\\), making the outcome dependent on both parameters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
