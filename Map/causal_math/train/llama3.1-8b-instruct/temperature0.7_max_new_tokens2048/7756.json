  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz \\\\), where M is a constant matrix. Suppose an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{Nt'} z(t') dt' \\\\) is applied, where N is another constant matrix.\n\nKnowing the state at \\\\( t = T \\\\), can we uniquely identify whether transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) or \\\\( U(z) \\\\) or both were used based solely on the output state?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple intervention scenarios can lead to similar or indistinguishable end states due to overlapping effects and non-unique solutions generated by the matrix exponentials. Deciphering exact interventions strictly from end states is typically unfeasible without additional system history.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "M → z; z → T(z); N → T(z); t → T(z); T(z) → output state; output state → identification of T(z) or U(z)"
