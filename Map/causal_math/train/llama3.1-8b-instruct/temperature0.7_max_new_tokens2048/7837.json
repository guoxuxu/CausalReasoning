  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant, and an integral transformation \\( T[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt \\). We study how the transformation influences the properties of function \\( f \\) over complex domain.\n\nIf the function \\( f(z) \\) is transformed by \\( T \\) and no further actions are applied, will \\( T[f](s) \\) at any \\( s \\) not relate to the original \\( f(z) \\) for all \\( z \\) in the complex plane?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T[f](s) \\) simplifies to evaluating \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{at} \\, dt \\), which is analytically tractable and does not completely disconnect from \\( f(z) \\). It essentially extracts characteristics of \\( f \\) related to its decay or growth, moderated by the real part of \\( a - s \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
