  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where D is a diffusion constant. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{-k^2 t} \\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform, on the temporal evolution of \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nGiven the final observed state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\), \\\\( S(u) \\\\), or both), based solely on the value of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The ultimate form of \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) can result from various possible combinations and timings of applications of \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( S(u) \\\\). The loss of information through diffusion and the integral transformations' effects complicates backtracking to the specific interventions or their sequence.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
