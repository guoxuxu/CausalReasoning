  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), defined as \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\). This transformation is used in analyzing a system's behavior, where s is a complex variable. The function \\\\( f(t) = t^2 \\\\) is subjected to a transformation where it is multiplied by \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) before taking the Laplace transform, resulting in a new function \\\\( g(t) = e^{at}t^2 \\\\).\n\nKnowing only the Laplace transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\), can we correctly identify the original function \\\\( f(t) \\\\) as \\\\( t^2 \\\\) without knowing the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific knowledge that \\\\( e^{at} \\\\) was applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\), it is indistinguishable whether the original function was \\\\( t^2 \\\\) or some other function modified to result in the observed transform, due to different possible values of a affecting the s-domain shift.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
