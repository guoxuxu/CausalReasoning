  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where k is the thermal diffusivity constant. The function is initially transformed by \\\\( f(u) = e^{\\\\lambda t} u \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a constant.\n\nGiven the thermal distribution \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\) at time T, can we accurately determine the specific interventions (whether \\\\( f(u) \\\\), \\\\( g(u) \\\\), or both) applied during the evolution, solely based on the value of \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the non-distinctive interaction of the exponential transformations \\\\( e^{\\\\lambda t} u \\\\) and \\\\( e^{\\\\mu t} u \\\\) with the progressive heat diffusion described by the heat equation, multiple combinations of interventions (or lack thereof) may lead to comparable or identical thermal states at T. This ambiguity makes it impossible to uniquely deduce the exact set of interventions solely from the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
