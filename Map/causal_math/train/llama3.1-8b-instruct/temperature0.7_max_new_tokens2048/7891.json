  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the system's response under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), applied over a time interval from 0 to T.\n\nSuppose an intervention modifies \\\\( k \\\\) to \\\\( k' = k + \\\\Delta k \\\\) at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) during the interval [0, T]. Will the outcome of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) solely depend on the original dynamics described by \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) without being affected by \\\\( \\\\Delta k \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changing \\\\( k \\\\) to \\\\( k' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) alters the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from that point onwards, affecting the accumulated effect within the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\). Therefore, the outcome of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) will reflect both the original dynamic under \\\\( i\\\\omega \\\\) and the adjustment from \\\\( \\\\Delta k \\\\), indicating dependency on both factors.",
