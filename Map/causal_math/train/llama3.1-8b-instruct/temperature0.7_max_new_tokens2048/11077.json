  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation of a function \\\\( h(x) \\\\) defined by \\\\( H(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-sx} h(x) dx \\\\), known as the Laplace transform. We analyze the behavior of the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{rx} \\\\) under this transformation, where r is a constant, and how modifications to the function and parameters affect inferences regarding cause and effect.\n\nIf \\\\( h(x) \\\\) as defined above undergoes a Laplace transform to become \\\\( H(s) \\\\), and is further transformed by scaling s by a factor of \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) without other intervention, will \\\\( H(\\\\alpha s) \\\\) at transformation \\\\( s = s_0 \\\\) be identical to the directly calculated \\\\( H(\\\\alpha s_0) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The property of the Laplace transform with the function \\\\( h(x) = e^{rx} \\\\) ensures linearity, and scaling the transform variable s by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) corresponds directly with this scaling being reflected in the transformed function. Therefore, \\\\( H(\\\\alpha s) \\\\) computed at \\\\( s = s_0 \\\\) is directly equivalent to computing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) at \\\\( s = \\\\alpha s_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
