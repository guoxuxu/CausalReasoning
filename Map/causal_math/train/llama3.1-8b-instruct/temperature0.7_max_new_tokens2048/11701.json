  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\), where \\\\( u(t) \\\\) and \\\\( v(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of \\\\( t \\\\), and \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit. We analyze the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) \\\\) on the function, shaping how it evolves over time.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) undergoes the Laplace transformation followed by its inversion without any modification, will the resulting function still be \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for all t?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform and its inverse form a pair, implying that applying both operations sequentially, without any modification, will recover the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) exactly as it began for all t.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
