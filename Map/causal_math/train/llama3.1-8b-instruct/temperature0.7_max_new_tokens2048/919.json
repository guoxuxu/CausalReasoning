  "Problem": "Consider an integral transformation defined by the kernel \\\\( K(x, s) = e^{-x^2s} \\\\) applied to the function \\\\( f(s) = s^2 \\\\). We study the transformed function defined as \\\\( g(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty K(x, s) f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf another kernel transformation \\\\( L(x, s) = e^{-sx} \\\\) is applied as an intervention at some point during the transformation process, will the resultant function \\\\( g(x) \\\\) at any x only depend on the initial kernel \\\\( K(x, s) \\\\), without being influenced by \\\\( L(x, s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of an additional kernel transformation \\\\( L(x, s) \\\\) as an intervention modifies the pathways through which the function is transformed, contributing new elements to the resulting function. Therefore, \\\\( g(x) \\\\) becomes a function dependent on both kernels, not just the original.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The integral transformation g(x) depends only on the initial kernel K(x, s) and not on L(x, s) because L(x, s) only affects K(x, s) and g(x) is defined as the integral of the product of K(x, s) and f(s), making it independent of L(x, s)"
