  "Problem": "Consider a complex function system described by the transformation \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( w \\\\) is a real constant denoting angular frequency. We explore the impact of an integral transform \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{iws}z(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf the transform \\\\( T[z] \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T still be described solely by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T[z] \\\\) modifies the integral of the trajectory, not the state \\\\( z(t) \\\\) itself. Therefore, \\\\( z(t) = e^{iwt}z_0 \\\\) remains applicable for calculating the future state due to its intrinsic evolution, but \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will not incorporate any effects from \\\\( T[z] \\\\) spontaneously since \\\\( T[z] \\\\) impacts accumulated value rather than instantaneous state evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
