  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Schrödinger equation with a potential function \\( V(x, t) \\), such that \\( i\\\\hbar\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\psi}{\\\\partial x^2} + V(x,t)\\\\psi \\). We explore how applying a Fourier transform \\( \\\\mathcal{F}(\\\\psi(x, t)) \\\\) affects the wave function over time.\n\nCan we deduce the original wave function \\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\) at t = 0 after observing \\( \\\\psi(x, T) \\) at t = T without knowing whether the Fourier transform was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of Fourier transform application, the transformation may have altered the wave function in momentum space, obscuring its original form in position space. This makes it challenging to precisely retrieve \\( \\\\psi(x, 0) \\) without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
