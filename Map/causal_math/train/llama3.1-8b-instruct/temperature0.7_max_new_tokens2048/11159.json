  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and an integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-st} z(s) \\, ds \\) where \\( s \\) is a complex parameter.\n\nIf at a certain time \\( t_1 \\), a function \\( R(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{kt} z(s) \\, ds \\) (where \\( k \\) is a different complex parameter) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\( T(z(T)) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depend only on the initial Cauchy-Riemann dynamics and not on \\( s \\) or \\( k \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention \\( R(z) \\) introduces another integrating effect, making the final state \\( T(z(T)) \\) dependent not only on the Cauchy-Riemann dynamics but also significantly on the parameters \\( s \\) and \\( k \\). This additional transformation affects how the function evolves, changing the resultant transformation at \\( t = T \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
