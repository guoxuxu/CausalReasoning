  "Problem": "Consider a complex function scenario where \\\\( z(t) \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We consider the impact of the linear transformation defined by \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant matrix.\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without information regarding the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's impossible to correctly backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) because the initial transformation by \\\\( C \\\\) could have changed the magnitude and phase in ways that are not discernible merely from observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\), especially without knowing C.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
