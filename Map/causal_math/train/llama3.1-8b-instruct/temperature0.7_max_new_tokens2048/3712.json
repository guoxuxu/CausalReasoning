  "Problem": "Consider a harmonic oscillator described by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\ddot{x} + \\\\omega^2 x = 0\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) is the angular frequency. For analysis, we apply a Fourier transform to change the domain from time to frequency. Consider the transformation \\\\( F_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t} x(t) dt \\\\), which converts the time-domain function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) into its frequency-domain counterpart.\n\nCan we precisely determine both the original function \\\\(x(t)\\\\) and the external force \\\\(g(t)\\\\), given only the transformed function \\\\( F_x(\\\\omega) \\\\) in the frequency domain after the application of external force?",
  "Explanation": "While the inverse Fourier transform can retrieve a version of \\\\(x(t)\\\\) that includes effects of the external force, without additional data or constraints specifically about \\\\(g(t)\\\\), it is impossible to uniquely decompose and attribute parts of the observed \\\\( F_x(\\\\omega) \\\\) fully and correctly to either \\\\(x(t)\\\\) or \\\\(g(t)\\\\). The loss of causal information in the transformation complicates backward reconstruction of both functions distinctly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
