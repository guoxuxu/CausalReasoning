  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is a constant vector in complex space. This function is used to transform an initial vector in a complex vector space. We investigate the influence of applying an additional transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\) at a time t, where \\\\( D \\\\) is also a constant matrix.\n\nBased solely on the observation of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time T, can we infer the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) without knowing the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without the specific details of the matrix \\\\( A \\\\), it’s impossible to accurately deduce the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) because the transformation induced by \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\) depends critically on \\\\( A \\\\). Different matrices \\\\( A \\\\) could lead to vastly different trajectories and thus different outcomes for the same initial vector.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
