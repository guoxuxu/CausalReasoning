  "Problem": "Consider a function in the complex plane given by \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\), and its effect on the real part of complex numbers. We consider the transformation given by the operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by the integral transformation \\\\( T(f)(s) = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}f(t) \\\\, dt \\\\).\n\nGiven the output of the transformation \\\\( T(f)(s) \\\\), can we uniquely determine the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without additional information on the transformation applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T \\\\) and the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) can result in many potential inputs leading to the same output due to the nature of integral transformations and exponential functions in the complex plane, hindering the unique determination of \\\\( z_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
