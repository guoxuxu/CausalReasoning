  "Problem": "Analyze the effect of a transformation via a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\theta}w \\\\) on a complex plane where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) is a constant. Consider the system's change over time if it is described by the flow \\\\( \\\\dot{w} = kw \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we uniquely ascertain what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(w) \\\\), \\\\( h(w) \\\\), or both) based solely on the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining specific transformations from the final state \\\\( w(T) \\\\) is ambiguous due to the potential for different combinations of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\phi \\\\) to yield the same result, especially given the nature of complex exponentials and their effects on the phase and magnitude of \\\\( w \\\\). This overlap in effects means that multiple operational sequences can lead to the same endpoint.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
