  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), governed by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\) where A is a complex constant. We then apply a transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\), where B is another complex constant, to the function at time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to a complex function \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\) without further intervention, will the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was simply evolved to t = T under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\\\) modifies the initial conditions of the function, which then evolves differently under \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = Az \\\\). The presence of the exponential factor associated with B adds complexity and distinct characteristics to the evolution, resulting in a different outcome at time T.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
