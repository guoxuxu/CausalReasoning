  "Problem": "Consider a linear time-dependent system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + A\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} = 0\\\\), where A is a constant coefficient. An integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int e^{ikx} u(x, t) \\\\, dx \\\\) is applied to the function u(x, t).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(u) \\\\) is applied initially to the function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) and the resulting function is then evolved according to the given partial differential equation without further transformations, will the transformed function at time T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) was transformed at t = T directly?",
  "Explanation": "The linear PDE with constant coefficients is compatible under integral transforms with time and space variables separated. Therefore, transforming initially or after evolving the function will yield the same result due to the time-invariance of the system and the properties of the Fourier transform.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
