  "Problem": "Analyze an electrical circuit in which the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) over time t is driven by a complex function of voltage \\\\( V(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is the radian frequency. We explore how applying a Laplace transform to the voltage affects the current's behavior and the system's response.\n\nIf the Laplace transform of \\\\( V(t) \\\\) is applied to derive the system's transfer function without further alteration, does the transformed current \\\\( \\hat{I}(s) \\\\) at a complex frequency \\\\( s \\\\) signify a change in the total power delivered to the load?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform of the voltage function does not change the total power but rather provides a tool for analyzing the system’s behavior in the s-domain. The transformed current is a representation for analytical purposes and does not alter physical quantities like power.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
