  "Problem": "Consider a continuous complex function \\\\( f(z) \\\\) governed by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\\\). We analyze the transformation of this function using a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( F(f)(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(z) e^{-isz} dz \\\\).\n\nBased on the observed Fourier transform at time \\\\( t \\\\), is it possible to determine what interventions (such as multiplication by \\\\( z^2 \\\\)) were applied to the initial function?",
  "Explanation": "Various interventions could result in similar frequency transformations due to the exponential nature of the differential equation and polynomial modifications. Without additional constraints or knowledge about the exact form of the interventions, specific actions cannot be uniquely determined.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
