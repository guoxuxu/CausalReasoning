  "Problem": "Consider a complex function mapping operation where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves over time under the transformation \\\\( h(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t} z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a constant real number and \\\\( i \\\\) representing the imaginary unit.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another transformation \\\\( k(z) = e^{\\\\alpha t}z \\\\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real number) is applied as an intervention, does the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) only depend on \\\\( c \\\\) and not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) or \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiple transformations (both \\\\( h(z) \\\\) and subsequently \\\\( k(z) \\\\)) applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) modify the evolution path and final state at different rates and directions in the complex plane, making \\\\( z(T) \\\\) reliant on all parameters (\\\\( c, \\\\omega, \\\\alpha \\\\)), not just \\\\( c \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
