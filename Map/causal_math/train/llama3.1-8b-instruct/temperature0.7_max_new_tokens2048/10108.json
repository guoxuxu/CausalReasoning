  "Problem": "Analyze the complex valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, in the context of the integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\\\) with complex variable s.\n\nGiven the final transformation result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), can we conclusively determine whether the frequency was changed during the transformation process and what were the exact values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega' \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "No, the result \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) does not provide enough information to uniquely backtrack whether a change in frequency occurred, nor to distinguish precisely between potential values of \\\\( \\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\omega' \\\\), particularly without exact time of change and duration of each frequency segment.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
