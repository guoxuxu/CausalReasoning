  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z + \\\\kappa \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) are constants. We consider the impact of the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) on this system.\n\nIf an intervention is made by changing the value of \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) to a new constant \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the final Laplace transform of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) without showing effects of the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The change in \\\\( \\\\kappa \\\\) to \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) serves as an intervention altering the system's frequency and system response characteristics. The final Laplace transform reflects this change, indicating not just the effect of original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) but also the intervened value \\\\( \\\\kappa' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
