  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit containing an RLC (Resistor, Inductor, Capacitor) series circuit driven by a sinusoidal voltage source V(t) = V0 * sin(ωt). The relationship between the input voltage and current is governed by the differential equation L*d^2I/dt^2 + R*dI/dt + (1/C)*I = dV/dt, where I is the current, L is the inductance, R is the resistance, and C is the capacitance.\n\nIf the endpoint current measurement I(T) is obtained after an unknown intervention, can we establish whether the intervention involved changes to resistance, frequency, or both?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in circuit behavior like amplitude and phase shift provide clues about alterations to resistance or frequency, pinpointing the exact nature of modifications (whether in resistance, inductance, capacitance, frequency, or combinations thereof) without additional context or comparison to baseline measurements remains speculative. The overlapping influences of these variables create ambiguity in causal inference from outcome alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The intervention's effect on current I(T) can be related to changes in resistance R or frequency, but not inductance L or capacitance C, as these are not directly connected to the endpoint current measurement I(T)."
