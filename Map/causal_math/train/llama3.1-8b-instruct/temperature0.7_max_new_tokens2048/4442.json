  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\(z(t) = x(t) + i y(t)\\\\) defined on the complex plane, where \\\\(i\\\\) is the imaginary unit. The function is subjected to the transformation \\\\(f(z) = e^{At}z\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is a complex constant. The system's behavior is examined under this transformation over time \\\\(t\\\\).\n\nCan we infer the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) might have altered the trajectory from its natural course, making it impossible to accurately backtrack to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation had been applied, especially since the function can include exponential growth or decay along with rotation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
