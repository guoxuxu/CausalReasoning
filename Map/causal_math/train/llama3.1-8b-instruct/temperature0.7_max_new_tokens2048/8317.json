  "Problem": "Consider the Laplace transform of a function, \\\\( F(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{f(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\), where \\\\( f(t) = t^ne^{at} \\\\) with constants \\\\( n \\\\) and \\\\( a \\\\). Analysis investigates how operations on \\\\( F(s) \\\\) can deduce properties or behaviors of functions over time and under transformations.\n\nIf \\\\( F(s) \\\\) is analyzed to understand the impact of changing \\\\( a \\\\) to a new value \\\\( a' \\\\) without intervention, will the Laplace transform directly reflect these changes?",
  "Explanation": "Changing \\\\( a \\\\) to \\\\( a' \\\\) directly affects the function \\\\( f(t) = t^ne^{a't} \\\\), thus the Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{t^ne^{a't}\\\\}(s) \\\\) will reflect the parameter change, showing a shift in the convergence and poles of the transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
