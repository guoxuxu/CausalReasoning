  "Problem": "Consider an electric circuit governed by the differential equation \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\), where L is inductance, R is resistance and E(t) represents a time-dependent electromotive force. Further, suppose that an operator \\\\( T \\\\) defined by multiplying the current amplitude by a scalar \\\\( k \\\\) is applied, and we explore how this affects the response of the system over time t.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( T(I) = kI \\\\) is applied to the initial current \\\\( I_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and the system is then allowed to evolve under \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\) without further intervention, will the current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at t = T be equivalent to starting with \\\\( I_0 \\\\) and evolving directly to t = T under \\\\( L \\\\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = E(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(I) = kI \\\\) changes the initial condition of the system. The solution to the differential equation depends on the initial current, so an initial multiplication by \\\\( k \\\\) scales all subsequent currents by the same factor, affecting the overall system response compared with direct evolution from \\\\( I_0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
