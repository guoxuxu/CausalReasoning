  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where both \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax + By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy \\\\), where A, B, C, and D are constants. We analyze the impact of the transformation defined by the function \\\\( g(z) = e^{Jt}z \\\\) over time t, where J is a complex constant.\n\nIf at a specific time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another function \\\\( h(z) = e^{Kt}z \\\\) (where K is a complex constant) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A, B, C, D and not on J or K?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( h(z) \\\\) introduces an additional complex factor, making the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) dependent on J, K as well as the constants A, B, C, and D. The interaction of these transformations adds layers of complexity to how the system reaches its endpoint at \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
