  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a vector space involving a matrix \\\\( P \\\\) representing a projection operator onto a subspace. Let us explore the changes in vectors under the operations defined by another matrix \\\\( Q \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is an orthogonal matrix representing a rotation.\n\nIf a vector \\\\( v \\\\) is first projected by \\\\( P \\\\), and then unexpectedly intervened by an operation \\\\( R \\\\), another rotation matrix, before finally being rotated by \\\\( Q \\\\), will the final vector still be dependent on \\\\( P \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial projection reduces the vector's dimensionality, whereby certain dimensions are diminished or lost, which affects how subsequent transformations, including the unexpected rotation, influence the final state. Thus, \\\\( P \\\\) plays a critical role in determining the properties of the final vector.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
