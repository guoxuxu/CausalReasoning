  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the system of differential equations \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Az + B \\\\), where A and B are complex constants. We explore the role of the Laplace transform \\\\( L(z)(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(s) \\\\) which transforms this function into the s-domain, affecting the evolution of z.\n\nIf an intervention is applied at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) through a modification of the function, like a Fourier transform \\\\( F(z)(\\\\omega) = \\\\mathcal{F}\\\\{z(t)\\\\}(\\\\omega) \\\\), will the final behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = T \\\\) (T > t_1) still align only based on parameters A and B without influence from the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a Fourier transform as an intervention modifies how we interact with or potentially alter the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) post-intervention could be dependent on the nature and handling of the Fourier transform, impacting the resultant time-domain behavior at \\\\( t = T \\\\), depending on if or how the transformation is reversed or utilized.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
