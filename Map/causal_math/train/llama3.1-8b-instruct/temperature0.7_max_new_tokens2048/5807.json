  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{sx} f(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), where \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is a continuous function on the interval [0, T], and s is a complex scalar. We are interested to determine how transformations to \\\\( f(x) \\\\) like \\\\( f(x) = f(x) + g(x) \\\\), where \\\\( g(x) \\\\) is another continuous function, impacts the resulting function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), an intervention modifies \\\\( f(x) \\\\) to include an additional term \\\\( h(x) \\\\) forming \\\\( f''(x) = f(x) + h(x) \\\\) for the remainder of the interval, will the final value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depend on this additional function?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention that introduces \\\\( h(x) \\\\) from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T changes the function being integrated, directly impacting the computed value of the integral from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. Hence, the final value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will indeed include the effects of the addition of \\\\( h(x) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
