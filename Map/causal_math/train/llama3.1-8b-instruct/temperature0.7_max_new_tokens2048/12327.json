  "Problem": "Consider a linear system governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Dx\\\\), where D is a diagonalizable matrix. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( h(x) = U^{-1}x \\\\), where U is a matrix that diagonalizes D (i.e., \\\\( UDU^{-1} = D' \\\\) is a diagonal matrix).\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what transformations were applied (whether \\\\( h(x) \\\\), \\\\( k(x) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing \\\\( x(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple sequences or types of transformations can lead to equivalent states at \\\\( x(T) \\\\). Due to compositional ambiguities and the potential overlap in their effects, it is challenging to uniquely identify the specific transformations applied from the final state alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
