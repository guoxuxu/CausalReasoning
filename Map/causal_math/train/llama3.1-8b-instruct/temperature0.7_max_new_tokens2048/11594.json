  "Problem": "Analyze the interaction between a linear transformation \\\\( T(v) = Mv \\\\) and a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(v) \\\\) applied to vector \\\\( v \\\\) in Euclidean space. Matrix \\\\( M \\\\) is constant, and the Fourier transform operates on function space representations of \\\\( v \\\\).\n\nCan we infer the original vector \\\\( v \\\\) from the output of the sequence of Fourier transform then linear transformation without knowing whether the original operation was linear transformation followed by Fourier transform?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformed output after a Fourier transform and a subsequent linear transformation, pinpointing whether the initial operation was a linear or Fourier transformation first would be highly challenging. The transformations encapsulate complex changes which are not easily reversible, especially without explicit information about the order and the specific transformations applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
