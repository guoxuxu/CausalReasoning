  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) are vectors, and \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\) are constant matrices. This setup is used to analyze the interaction between the two exponential terms over time.\n\nIf an intervention applying a transformation \\\\( g(u) = e^{Ct}u \\\\) (where U encompasses both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix) is introduced at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the system’s state at a later time \\\\( T \\\\) still clearly reflect separate transformations governed by matrices \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with transformation \\\\( g(u) \\\\) modifies both \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( y \\\\) elements simultaneously, which means the new state of the system encapsulates mixed exponential influences of both \\\\( A \\\\), \\\\( B \\\\), and \\\\( C \\\\). This results in an integrated and more complex dynamics than separate tensor exponential impacts.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
