  "Problem": "Imagine analyzing the influence on a solution space by the operator \\\\( T: V \\\\rightarrow V \\\\) in the context of linear algebra, where T is defined as \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) for a matrix A and S is a linear subspace of V which is invariant under T. Consider the subsequent application of a transformation \\\\( f(x) = Bx \\\\), where B is another matrix, to an initial vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in S.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is applied to vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) in S, then allowing it to evolve under T without further intervention, will the outcome at time t = T (considering the repeated action of T here as iterative applications) stay within the subspace S?",
  "Explanation": "The application of \\\\( f(x) = Bx \\\\) potentially moves the vector \\\\( x_0 \\\\) out of the invariant subspace S unless B specifically maps S onto itself or into another subspace that is also invariant under T. Thus without these specific conditions, the iterative application of T on \\\\( Bx_0 \\\\) will not necessarily keep the vector within S.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
