  "Problem": "Consider a mathematical model that describes the diffusion of a pollutant in a river, represented by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial c}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 c}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\) where c is the concentration of the pollutant and D is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nIf the diffusion coefficient D is increased at time t = 0, will the spread of the pollutant at a downstream location at time T be greater, compared to the scenario where D remains constant?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the diffusion coefficient D enhances the rate at which the pollutant spreads out. Thus, at any fixed downstream location, the concentration of the pollutant will reach earlier and potentially in higher amounts at time T when compared to a constant diffusion scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
