  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = {\\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{sA} x(s) ds} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix, and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) is a function defined by some physical or chemical process. We assess the effect of the linear operator \\\\( L(z) = Bz \\\\), with B being another constant matrix, on the system.\n\nIf at a time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), another operator \\\\( M(z) = Cz \\\\) (where \\\\( C \\\\) is another constant matrix) is applied as an intervention, does the final state of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for t > t_1 only depend on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( B \\\\) or \\\\( C \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention with \\\\( M(z) \\\\) introduces additional modifications, making the state at any time t > t_1 dependent on matrices \\\\( B \\\\) and \\\\( C \\\\), as well as on \\\\( A \\\\). Due to cumulative effects of matrix operations, the end state is affected by both initial and intervening transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
