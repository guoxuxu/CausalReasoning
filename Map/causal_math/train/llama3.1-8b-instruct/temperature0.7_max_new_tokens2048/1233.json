  "Problem": "Consider the effect of the complex function \\\\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\\\) on the complex plane, where \\\\( c \\\\) is a fixed complex constant. This function is related to iterative mappings used in fractal generation like the Mandelbrot set. We investigate how initial values and transformations influence the resulting behavior after multiple iterations.\n\nIf an initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is iteratively mapped using \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without any other transformation, will the sequence necessarily remain bounded for all \\\\( c \\\\) within the Mandelbrot set?",
  "Explanation": "For values of \\\\( c \\\\) within the Mandelbrot set, the sequence generated by iterating \\\\( z_{n+1} = f(z_n) = z_n^2 + c \\\\) is known to remain bounded. This property defines points within the Mandelbrot set itself, based on how the sequence behaves under iteration starting from \\\\( z_0 = 0 \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "c → z_0; z_0 → z; z → z^2; z^2 → boundedness; c ∈ Mandelbrot set → z_0 → z^2 → boundedness"
