  "Problem": "Suppose we have a complex function \\\\( z = g(w) = e^{i\\\\omega t}w \\\\), where \\\\( w \\\\) is a complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant. This function is used to modify the initial conditions of a particle's state in a quantum system described by \\\\( \\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi_0 \\\\), where \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is a unitary time evolution operator.\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(w) \\\\) is initially applied to the state \\\\( \\psi_0 \\\\) and the system evolves according to \\\\( \\psi(t) = U(t)\\psi_0 \\\\) after this application, will the final state \\\\( \\psi(T) \\\\) at time T be the same as if \\\\( \\psi_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to T under \\\\( U(t) \\\\) without applying \\\\( g(w) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The initial application of \\\\( g(w) = e^{i\\\\omega t}w \\\\) modifies the initial state by adding a phase factor. Even though \\\\( U(t) \\\\) is unitary and preserves the norm, the additional phase factor introduced by \\\\( g(w) \\\\) results in a different quantum state at time T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
