  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions representing position in 2D space over time t. Transformations are applied via \\\\( g(z) = e^{At}z \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce which interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both) by solely analyzing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) given \\\\( z_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Identifying specific interventions just by observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is complex due to the non-linearity and superposition of transformations \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{Bt} \\\\). Multiple distinct sets of interventions could lead to the same final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) because of the properties of exponential functions in complex space, making it impossible to uniquely determine the transformations used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
