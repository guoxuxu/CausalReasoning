  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(x) = e^{Ax} \\\\) where A is a constant complex matrix. We investigate the relationship between applying the Laplace transform on \\\\( z(x) \\\\) and its inverse, and how transformations like matrix exponentiation affect this process.\n\nCan we determine the matrix A by observing the output of the inverse Laplace transform of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(x)) \\\\) without prior knowledge of the transformations applied?",
  "Explanation": "Given the inverse Laplace transform returns us to our original function \\\\( e^{Ax} \\\\), and knowing the functional form of the output allows us to determine the matrix A, as it is directly linked to the structure of the exponentiated matrix in the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Laplace transform of z(x) → z(s); z(s) → inverse Laplace transform of z(s); z(x) → matrix exponentiation of A; matrix exponentiation of A → z(x); inverse Laplace transform of z(s) → matrix A"
