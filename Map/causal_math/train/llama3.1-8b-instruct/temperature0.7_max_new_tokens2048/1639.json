  "Problem": "Consider a system where the rate of heat transfer \\\\( Q(t) \\\\) in a rod is governed by the heat equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = k \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2} \\\\), where \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) represents the temperature distribution along the rod. A transformation \\\\( f(u) = u + h \\\\), where h is a constant heating term, is applied to the rod's temperature distribution.\n\nIf a cooling term \\\\( g(u) = u - c \\\\), where c is a constant, is applied as an intervention partway through the time evolution, will the final temperature distribution depend only on the initial heating term h?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of a cooling term \\\\( g(u) = u - c \\\\) alters the state yet again, making the final temperature distribution dependent not just on the initial application of h, but also on the subsequent cooling by c. The system's trajectory is fundamentally influenced by both interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
