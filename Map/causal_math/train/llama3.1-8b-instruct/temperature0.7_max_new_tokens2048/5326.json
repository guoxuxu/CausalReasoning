  "Problem": "Consider a system of complex functions \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions satisfying the differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant real matrices. An integral transformation is applied, defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{t} e^{Ct'} z(t') dt' \\\\), where C is a constant matrix.\n\nCan we reconstruct the original function \\\\( z_0(t) \\\\) at t = 0 after analyzing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing if \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), it's challenging to deduce the exact original function as the integral transformation with matrix C may have significantly altered initial states and trajectories that cannot be simply inverted without further information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
