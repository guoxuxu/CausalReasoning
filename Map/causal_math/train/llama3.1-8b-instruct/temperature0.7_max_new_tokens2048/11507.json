  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output is described as \\\\( z = Hx \\\\), where \\\\( x \\\\) is a vector of input variables, and \\\\( H \\\\) is a transformation matrix. The evolution of \\\\( x \\\\) is governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Mx \\\\), where \\\\( M \\\\) is a constant matrix. We analyze how the impulse response defined by the function \\\\( g(x) = e^{Dt}x \\\\) (where \\\\( D \\\\) is another constant matrix) affects the system over time.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention via a new function \\\\( h(x) = e^{Kt}x \\\\) (\\\\( K \\\\) being another constant matrix) is applied, will the final output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at time \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) depend solely on \\\\( M \\\\) and not on \\\\( D \\\\) or \\\\( K \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The added intervention with \\\\( h(x) \\\\) introduces yet another dynamic layer altering \\\\( x \\\\), which consequently influences \\\\( z(T) \\\\). The overall impact on the final value of \\\\( z \\\\) at time \\\\( T \\\\) results from the compounded effects of \\\\( M \\\\), \\\\( D \\\\), and \\\\( K \\\\). Each matrix could potentially modify the input trajectory significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
