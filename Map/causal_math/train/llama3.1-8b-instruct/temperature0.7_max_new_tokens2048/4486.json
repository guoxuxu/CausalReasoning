  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}x \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\( x \\\\) is the initial vector in \\\\( \\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\). The function examines evolution under a rotational transformation in the complex plane over time \\\\( t \\\\).\n\nIf only \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is observed, can we determine the original vector \\\\( x \\\\) at \\\\( t=0 \\\\), solely based on \\\\( z(T) = e^{iAT}x \\\\), without any additional information on the matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Without exact knowledge of \\\\( A \\\\), specifically its conformation and eigenvalues, the initial vector \\\\( x \\\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\\\( z(T) \\\\). Multiple matrices \\\\( A \\\\) could yield the same \\\\( z(T) \\\\) from different initial vectors, given the periodic nature of complex exponentials and potential degeneracies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
