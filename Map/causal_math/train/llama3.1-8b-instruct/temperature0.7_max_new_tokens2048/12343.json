  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant. Let's examine the system's behavior under the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) and perform perturbations using multiplication by another function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a positive real constant.\n\nGiven the altered frequency spectrum after applying \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) and \\( h(t) \\), can we determine precisely whether \\( h(t) \\) was applied based solely on the new spectrum?",
  "Explanation": "The convolution of the Fourier transforms of \\( z(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) results in a spectrum that could potentially match the effects of different exponential decay factors \\( \\alpha \\) or be mimicked by other transformations. Hence, we cannot uniquely identify the specific intervention of \\( h(t) \\) from the altered spectrum alone.",
