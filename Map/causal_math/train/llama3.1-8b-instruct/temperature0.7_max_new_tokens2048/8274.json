  "Problem": "Consider a system where the behavior of a function \\\\(z(t)\\\\) over time is determined by its Laplace Transform \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} \\\\. Suppose we apply the inverse Laplace transform after manipulating the function in the s-domain by multiplying with a transfer function \\\\(H(s)\\\\).\n\nConsidering the observation of \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) after applying \\\\( H(s) \\\\) and the inverse Laplace Transform, can we infer the exact form of the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( H(s) \\\\) could fundamentally alter the behavior of \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), reconstructing the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z'(t) \\\\) without knowing \\\\( H(s) \\\\) is not feasible because multiple different functions \\\\( z(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(s) \\\\) could result in the same modified function \\\\( z'(t) \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
