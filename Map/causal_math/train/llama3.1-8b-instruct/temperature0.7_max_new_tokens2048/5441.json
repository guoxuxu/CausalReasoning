  "Problem": "Consider a system characterized by a complex function \\\\( z(t) =  x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions describing a signal's components in time. A Fourier transform \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is applied to transform \\\\( z(t) \\\\) into the frequency domain.\n\nIf \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is transformed into the frequency domain using a Fourier transform, and then \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) is left unmodified, can we expect the inverse Fourier transform to reproduce the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) accurately?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is linear and invertible under suitable conditions (like integrability and smoothness of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)). Assuming no modifications in the frequency domain, the inverse transform of \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) should yield the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
