  "Problem": "In this system, we consider the equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d}{dt}z(t) = Dz(t)\\\\), where \\\\(D\\\\) is a diagonalizable matrix. We will explore the consequences of applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = Ke^{Mt}z\\\\) where \\\\(K\\\\) is a constant matrix and \\\\(M\\\\) is another diagonalizable matrix.\n\nGiven the state \\\\(z(T)\\\\), can we infer the original vector \\\\(z_0\\\\) at t = 0 without confirmation that \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of \\\\(K\\\\) and exponentials could modify the state in ways dependent on their alignment or misalignment with \\\\(D\\\\). Without knowing if \\\\(g(z)\\\\) was executed, it's infeasible to reconstruct \\\\(z_0\\\\) uniquely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
