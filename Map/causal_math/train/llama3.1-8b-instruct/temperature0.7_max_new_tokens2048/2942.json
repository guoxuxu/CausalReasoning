  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations given by \\\\(Ax = b\\\\), where A is a matrix and b is a vector. We investigate the influence of a transformation \\\\(f(x) = Mx + c\\\\), where M is another matrix and c is a constant vector, on the solution x.\n\nCan we recover the original vector \\\\(x_0\\\\) exactly after observing \\\\(x(T)\\\\) at time T, assuming we do not know whether the transformation \\\\(f(x)\\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing whether and how the transformation \\\\(f(x) = Mx + c\\\\) was applied, it is impossible to uniquely determine the original vector \\\\(x_0\\\\). Multiple different \\\\(x_0\\\\) could lead to the same \\\\(x(T)\\\\) due to the introduction of M and c.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
