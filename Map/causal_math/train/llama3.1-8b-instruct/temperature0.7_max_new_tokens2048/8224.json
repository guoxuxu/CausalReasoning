  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation defined by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) where \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is the Laplace Transform. Let \\( f(t) \\) be a function such that \\( f(t) = t^2 \\). We intervene by adding a constant \\( k \\) to \\( f(t) \\), modifying it to \\( f_k(t) = t^2 + k \\) before applying \\( \\mathcal{L} \\).\n\nGiven the output of \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{ f_k(t) \\} \\), is it possible to determine exactly what value \\( k \\) was used, assuming \\( f(t) = t^2 \\)?",
  "Explanation": "If the resultant transform is known, one can subtract \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} \\) from the output to find \\( \\frac{k}{s} \\). Solving for \\( k \\) in this expression will give us the exact value of the intervention \\( k \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
