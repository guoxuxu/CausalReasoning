  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t. This function is subjected to an integral transformation \\\\( Z(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nIf the function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) is modified at t = 0 by a function \\\\( h(t) = e^{At}z(t) \\\\), where A is a real number, and then transformed by \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), will the resulting transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) be the same as if \\\\( z(t) \\\\) underwent the transformation without modification?",
  "Explanation": "The modification of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) by \\\\( h(t) \\\\) introduces a factor of \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) which alters the time dependency of z. This exponential factor changes the rate of decay or growth in the integrand, affecting the values of the integral transform \\\\( Z(s) \\\\). Thus, the output will be inherently different.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
