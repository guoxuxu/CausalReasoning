  "Problem": "Assess the role of the Laplace transform in a system governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D \\\\nabla^2 u \\), where D is a diffusion constant. Analyze the outcomes when the function \\( h(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s + \\\\alpha} \\) (where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a positive constant) is applied as a Laplace transform modifier at initial and various times.\n\nCan the original spatial distribution \\( u(x,0) \\\\) be accurately inferred from observing \\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T if it is unknown whether \\( h(s) \\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without definitive knowledge of the Laplace transform's modification by \\( h(s) \\), distinguishing whether the exponential decay term \\( e^{-\\\\alpha t} \\) influenced the evolution is not feasible. This ambiguity prevents accurate back-calculation of the initial condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
