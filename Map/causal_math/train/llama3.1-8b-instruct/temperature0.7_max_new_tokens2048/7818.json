  "Problem": "Consider a physical system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = D\\\\nabla^2 u \\\\), where D is a diffusion constant. We analyze the influence of a transformation defined by the integral operator \\\\( T(u) = \\\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(e^{-k^2 t} \\\\mathcal{F}(u)) \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) is the Fourier transform, on the temporal evolution of \\\\( u \\\\).\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without clear knowledge of whether the transform \\\\( T(u) \\\\) was applied, and given the irreversible nature of certain integral transformations (loss of specific frequency information), reconstructing the exact original state \\\\( u(x,0) \\\\) is generally infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
