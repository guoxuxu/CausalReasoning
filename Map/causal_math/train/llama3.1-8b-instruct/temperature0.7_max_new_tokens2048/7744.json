  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) defined in the complex plane, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = pz + q \\\\), where p and q are complex constants. We analyze the impact of the transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^k \\\\) (where k is a positive integer) and its influence on the behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) over time.\n\nGiven the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine accurately what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), merely by knowing the resultant value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) can potentially be achieved through various combinations of applications of \\\\( g(z) \\\\) and \\\\( h(z) \\\\). The complex exponential growth and polynomial transformation effects overlap in a way that they might yield the same endpoint from different initial states and transformations—thus making it impossible to uniquely pinpoint which interventions were applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
