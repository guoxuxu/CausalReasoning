  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency. This function represents an oscillatory behavior in the complex plane. We explore the effect of a transformation \\\\( T(z) = z^n \\\\), where \\\\( n \\\\) is a positive integer, on the function's behavior.\n\nIf \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0, and then allowed to evolve under its natural oscillatory behavior without further intervention, will the transformed function \\\\( T(z(t)) \\\\) at a later time t = T exhibit the same frequency of oscillation as the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation changes the fundamental frequency of the oscillation. Specifically, \\\\( T(z(t)) = T(e^{i\\omega t}) = (e^{i\\omega t})^n = e^{i n \\omega t} \\\\), so the frequency is multiplied by \\\\( n \\\\). Therefore, the frequency of oscillation in \\\\( T(z(t)) \\\\) is different from the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\).",
