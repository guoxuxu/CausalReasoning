  "Problem": "Consider a linear operator \\( T \\) represented by a constant matrix applied to vector space \\( V \\). This operator is part of the integral transformation \\( y(x) = \\int_{a}^{b} T f(\\xi) K(x,\\xi) \\, d\\xi \\), where \\( K(x,\\xi) \\) is the kernel function for the transformation.\n\nCan the original kernel function \\( K(x, \\xi) \\) be determined uniquely by analyzing \\( y(x) \\) after transformation, without prior knowledge of \\( K \\)?",
  "Explanation": "Determining \\( K(x, \\xi) \\) from \\( y(x) \\) alone is problematic due to the potential for multiple kernel functions to result in the same output under different conditions or configurations of \\( f \\) and \\( T \\). Additional information about \\( f \\) and \\( T \\) is required for unique identification of \\( K \\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The original kernel function K(x, ξ) cannot be determined uniquely by analyzing y(x) after transformation, without prior knowledge of K, because T and K are interchangeable in the transformation, and y only depends on the product of T and K."
