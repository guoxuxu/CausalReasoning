  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iAz \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant. We look into how the function \\\\( h(z) = e^{iBt}z \\\\), with \\\\( B \\\\) also a real constant, affects \\\\( z(t) \\\\).\n\nIf a new function \\\\( k(z) = e^{iCt}z \\\\) (with C being another real constant) is applied at a specific time t1 as an intervention, will the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t1 only depend on the initial condition and A, not B or C?",
  "Explanation": "With the interventions using \\\\( k(z) \\\\), the final state at T is influenced by the sequence of phase shifts due to B initially and C at t1. Both constants alter the trajectory of the original system defined by A, hence the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) depends on A, B, and C.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
