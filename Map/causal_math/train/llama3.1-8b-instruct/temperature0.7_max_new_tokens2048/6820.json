  "Problem": "Consider a system described by a partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u) \\\\), where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. The impact of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\), which converts the function \\\\( u(x,t) \\\\) into its frequency components \\\\( \\\\hat{u}(k,t) \\\\), is analyzed over time.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\), can we precisely identify the specific filtering operations used (if any), solely by examining \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting state \\\\( u(x,T) \\\\) does not uniquely determine the type of interventions (such as specific filters) applied during the evolution. Multiple different filters could potentially lead to similar or identical outcomes at \\\\( T \\\\), especially without additional information or constraints about the changes to frequency components.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
