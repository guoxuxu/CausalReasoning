  "Problem": "Analyze a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions of time governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. The effect of a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct} z \\\\) over time t, with C being a constant matrix, is considered.\n\nCan we infer the original complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 after observing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = T without knowing whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowledge of the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), and because the transformations \\\\( e^{Ct} \\\\) might significantly alter the trajectory and phase due to complex exponential factors, deducing \\\\( z_0 \\\\) uniquely from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
