  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant. We look at how the Laplace transform affects this function over the variable t, focusing on the transformation \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s - i\\\\omega} \\\\), where s is a complex variable.\n\nIf the Laplace transform is applied to the complex function at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\), then allowing \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to evolve naturally with time under its original definition without further transformation, will the original function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) be preserved?",
  "Explanation": "The Laplace transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) doesn't affect the time domain behavior of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). The effect of \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) is merely representational, translating the function into the s-domain without altering the original time function's evolution determined by \\\\( e^{i\\\\omega t} \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
