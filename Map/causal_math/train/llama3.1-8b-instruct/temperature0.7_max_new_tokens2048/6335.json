  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) subject to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. The role of the Laplace transformation defined by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\) on this system is analyzed.\n\nIf an additional term \\\\( h(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a real constant, is introduced into the system at time \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) and the system is then observed over time, will \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\\\) for s in the complex plane remain the same as without the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of \\\\( h(t) \\\\) modifies the original system by changing the form of the differential equation, effectively altering the solution z(t). This change will be reflected in the Laplace transform, resulting in a different expression than if \\\\( h(t) \\\\) had not been introduced. \\\\( h(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) transforms into \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{s-\\\\alpha} \\\\) in the s-domain, altering the resulting system equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
