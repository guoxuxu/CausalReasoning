  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the equation \\\\(z = x^T C x + bx\\\\), where x is a vector, C is a symmetric matrix, and b is another vector. We are examining the effect of the transformation \\\\(h(x) = Dx\\\\), where D is a regular matrix, on the output z.\n\nConsidering the final value of z, can we determine what transformations were applied to x (whether \\\\(h(x)\\\\), \\\\(j(x)\\\\), or otherwise), solely based on the observation of z?",
  "Explanation": "Determining the specific transformations applied to x solely from the endpoint z is impractical due to the mathematical complications introduced by the quadratic and linear forms in the system equation, alongside potential overlaps in effects from different transformations D and E.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
