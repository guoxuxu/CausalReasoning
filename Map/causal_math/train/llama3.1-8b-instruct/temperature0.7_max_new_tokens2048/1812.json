  "Problem": "Consider the integration transformation of a complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^{az} \\\\) defined on a contour in the complex plane. The contour integral \\\\( \\\\int_C f(z) \\\\, dz \\\\) is analyzed over a closed path C. Let \\\\( a \\\\) be a complex constant.\n\nKnowing the transformed integral value \\\\( \\\\int_C e^{az} \\\\, dz \\\\), can we precisely deduce the transformation matrix \\\\( B \\\\) given the endpoint and knowing that an intervention occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Manifestations of the transformed integral can result from multiple configurations of the matrix \\\\( B \\\\). Due to the potential complexity and multiplicity in defining transformations in complex analysis, accurately identifying \\\\( B \\\\) from the integral result alone is generally not feasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
