  "Problem": "Consider a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real constant frequency. We investigate the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t) dt \\\\) on this function.\n\nIf an intervention is applied by changing the frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) to a different value \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), will the subsequent Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) for \\\\( t > t_1 \\\\) reflect only the new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) ignoring the original \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) post intervention will contain components of both the original frequency \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) and the new frequency \\\\( \\\\omega' \\\\) due to the presence of both frequencies at different times in the signal. Thus, it reflects a combination rather than just the new frequency.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
