  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) driven by a pair of differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), with A and B being constant scalars. We explore the effects of applying a transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\), where C is another constant scalar.\n\nGiven the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at some time T, is it possible to infer the exact initial conditions \\\\( x_0, y_0 \\\\) without knowing whether the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without certainty about the application of \\\\( f(z) \\\\), the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be the result of differing initial conditions modified by \\\\( e^{CT} \\\\). Since the differential equations govern the system independently per component, identifying the exact initial conditions from the effect alone isn't feasible without additional data on whether and how the transformation influenced the evolution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
