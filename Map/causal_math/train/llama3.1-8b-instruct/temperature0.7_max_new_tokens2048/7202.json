  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real constant representing angular frequency. We will explore how the transformation defined by \\\\( g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{sA}z(s) \\, ds \\\\), with A being a real constant, influences the behavior of the function over time t.\n\nGiven the transformed function at time T, can we determine the exact original complex function \\\\( z_0 = z(0) \\\\) if we do not know whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation by \\\\( g(z) \\\\) introduces complexities such as integration and exponential impacts that can significantly alter the state of \\\\( z(0) \\\\). Without knowing the presence of \\\\( g(z) \\\\), it is impossible to reverse-engineer accurately to find \\\\( z_0 \\\\) since the original state could lead to multiple possible outcomes after transformation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
