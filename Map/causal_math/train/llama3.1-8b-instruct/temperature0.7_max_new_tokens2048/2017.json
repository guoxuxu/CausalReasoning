  "Problem": "Consider a control system where the state vector \\\\( z \\\\) evolves according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Mz + Nu \\\\), with M and N being constant matrices and \\\\( u \\\\) representing a control function. An integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{At}z(t) dt \\\\) is applied, where A is also a constant matrix.\n\nIf the control function \\\\( u \\\\) is set to a constant vector \\\\( u_0 \\\\) from time t = 0 to T, and no further changes are made, will the transformed state \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T be influenced solely by the initial condition \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and \\\\( u_0 \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformed state \\\\( T(z) \\\\) depends not only on the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) and the control \\\\( u_0 \\\\) but also on how the dynamics \\\\( Mz + Nu \\\\) integrate over time, affected by the matrix exponential \\\\( e^{At} \\\\). The particular interaction between M, N, and A fundamentally alters the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
