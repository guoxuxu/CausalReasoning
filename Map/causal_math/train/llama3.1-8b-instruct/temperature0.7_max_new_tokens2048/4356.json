  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real-valued functions governed by the linear differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively. A transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\\\) is applied, where \\\\( C \\\\) is a constant matrix.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we conclusively determine what interventions were applied (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both) by only using the information of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The variety of outcomes possible through different combinations and sequences of applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) and \\\\( g(z) \\\\), compounded by the non-commutative nature of matrix exponentials, render decoding the specific interventions from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) ambiguous and non-unique.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
