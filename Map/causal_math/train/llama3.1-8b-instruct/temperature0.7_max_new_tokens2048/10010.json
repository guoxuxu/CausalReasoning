  "Problem": "Analyze a complex dynamical system represented by a differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant matrix and z is a complex function. The evolution is studied under the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{Dt}z \\\\), where D is another constant matrix.\n\nBy knowing the state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at T, can we conclusively determine the initial state \\\\( z_0 \\\\) prior to applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\), without additional data on whether the transformation was used?",
  "Explanation": "Without explicit knowledge of the application of the transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\), ambiguity remains about the initial conditions due to the potential modification induced by \\\\( e^{Dt} \\\\). The presence of D, especially if it does not commute with C, may render \\\\( z_0 \\\\) indiscernible from \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
