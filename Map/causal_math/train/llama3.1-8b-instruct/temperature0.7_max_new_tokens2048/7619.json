  "Problem": "Consider a linear control system governed by the equation \\\\( dx/dt = Ax + Bu \\\\), where A is a matrix defining system dynamics, B is a matrix defining input effects, x is the state vector, and u is the control input. We examine the system under the influence of a control transformation defined by \\\\( u(t) = Kx(t) \\\\), where K is a constant matrix.\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\) a revised control strategy \\\\( u(t) = Cx(t) \\\\) (where C is a different constant matrix) is applied, does the endpoint state vector \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend solely on the initial dynamics matrix A?",
  "Explanation": "Implementing a different control strategy \\\\( u(t) = Cx(t) \\\\) modifies the system dynamics once again to \\\\( dx/dt = (A+BC)x \\\\). Therefore, the final state \\\\( x(T) \\\\) depends on matrices A, B, K, and C, reflecting changes due to both initial and modified control influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
