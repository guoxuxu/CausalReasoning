  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the linear partial differential equation \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) where \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear differential operator. We review the effect of the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) = \\\\hat{u} \\\\), and how it translates to solve the equation in the transformed domain.\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F}(u) \\\\) is applied to a function \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system evolves under \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\) without further intervention, will the result \\\\( u(x, t) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( u(x, 0) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( u_t = Lu \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier transform is a reversible, linear operation that changes the basis from the time to the frequency domain. Solving the equation in the frequency domain and translating it back gives the same result as solving it directly in the time domain, since the operations are equivalent under the linear operator \\\\( L \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
