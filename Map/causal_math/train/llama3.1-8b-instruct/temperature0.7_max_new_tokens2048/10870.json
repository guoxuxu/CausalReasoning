  "Problem": "Consider a vibrating mechanical system that can be mathematically modeled as a differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\\\\zeta\\\\omega\\\\frac{dx}{dt} + \\\\omega^2x = 0\\\\) where \\\\(\\\\zeta\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) are damping ratio and natural frequency respectively. Suppose an external impulse given by the function \\\\(f(t) = \\\\delta(t - t_0)\\\\) (Dirac delta function) applies at time \\\\(t_0\\\\).\n\nBy observing the frequency of oscillations of the mechanical system, can we uniquely determine if the external impulse was applied at \\\\(t_0\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The frequency \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) remains unchanged irrespective of whether the impulse was applied or not. The impulse affects the amplitude and phase but not the natural frequency of the oscillating system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "natural frequency → damping ratio; damping ratio → damped frequency; damped frequency → amplitude of oscillations; amplitude of oscillations → frequency of oscillations; external impulse → displacement of the system; displacement of the system → velocity of the system; velocity of the system → acceleration of the system; acceleration of the system → damped frequency; damped frequency → frequency of oscillations"
