  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) where \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number and \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a real frequency. Assess the influence of an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i \\omega \\tau} z(\\tau) d\\tau \\\\).\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is applied to the system at t = 0 and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\) without further intervention, does \\\\( T(z(t)) \\\\) at t = T influence the trajectory directly described by \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) integrates the system's behavior over time but does not directly alter the system's trajectory governed by \\\\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}z_0 \\\\), which evolves independently of the integration process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
