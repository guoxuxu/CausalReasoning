  "Problem": "Analyze the behavior of a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a matrix and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) the initial complex vector in a system. An integral transformation \\\\( T[z] = \\\\int e^{-At}z(t) dt \\\\) impacts this setup over a period \\\\( [0, T] \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifying \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\) at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( t_1 < T \\\\), is introduced, will the output of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) depend only on the new matrix \\\\( A' \\\\) and not on the original matrix \\\\( A \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The change in the system's matrix from \\\\( A \\\\) to \\\\( A' \\\\) during the evolution affects both the before and after states of \\\\( t_1 \\\\). The output of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) reflects the composite effect of both matrices on the integral's evaluation period, not just \\\\( A' \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
