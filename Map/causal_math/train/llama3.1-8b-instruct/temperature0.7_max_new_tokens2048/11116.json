  "Problem": "Let's examine a thermal system where temperature \\( T \\) at any point \\( x \\) and time \\( t \\) is governed by the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\), with \\( k \\) as the thermal diffusivity constant. We study the impact of a sudden temperature change applied using a function \\( f(T) = T + h \\), where \\( h \\) is a constant heat increment.\n\nBased on the end state \\( T(x,T) \\), can it be determined exactly which interventions were applied (whether \\( f(T) \\), \\( g(T) \\), or both), knowing only the value of \\( T(x,T) \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final temperature distribution \\( T(x,T) \\) could result from varying combinations of initial and intermediate interventions. Due to the linear nature of the heat equation, different sequences of applying \\( h \\) and \\( c \\) can result in the same temperature profile at \\( t = T \\), thus making it impossible to pinpoint the interventions precisely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
