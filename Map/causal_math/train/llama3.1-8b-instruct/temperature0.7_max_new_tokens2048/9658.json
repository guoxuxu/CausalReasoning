  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\), where \\\\( p(t) \\\\) is a complex function. We investigate the effects of an integral transformation \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^t e^{\\lambda s}z(s)ds \\\\) applied at time t, where \\\\( \\\\lambda \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nCan we deduce the precise original function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) after observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\) under \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = p(t)z \\\\) without knowing whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\) was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing if the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) occurred, determining \\\\( z(0) \\\\) is complicated as the transformation could alter the path of evolution, rendering it infeasible to reverse-engineer the original state or trajectory uniquely, especially considering the dependence on the complex exponential.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
