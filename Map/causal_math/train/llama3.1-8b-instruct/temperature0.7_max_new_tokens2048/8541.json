  "Problem": "Consider a system defined by the Laplace transform \\\\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\), where \\\\( t \\\\) represents time and \\\\( s \\\\) the complex frequency domain. We focus on the causal effect of inversion by considering the inverse Laplace transform to recover \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and examining the impact of additional transformation \\\\( g(t) = t^2 \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\) applied to \\\\( f(t) \\\\)\n\nIf the function \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is applied initially to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) and then \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is transformed to \\\\( F(s) \\\\), does the sequence affect the final form of \\\\( F(s) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(t) \\\\) modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) to \\\\( t^2 \\\\cdot f(t) \\\\), which when transformed via the Laplace transform changes the frequency domain representation due to the polynomial multiplication in time domain altering the s-domain characteristics. This leads to a different transform result compared to directly transforming \\\\( f(t) \\\\) without the application of \\\\( g(t) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
