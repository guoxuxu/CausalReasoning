  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a complex matrix, and \\\\( z \\\\) is a complex variable. The function evaluates the transformation of complex functions in the complex plane and further examines how transformations such as Fourier Transform affects the signal.\n\nIf the Fourier Transform is applied to \\\\( f(z) \\\\) resulting in \\\\( F(w) \\\\), does the transformed function \\\\( F(w) \\\\) retain all the properties of \\\\( f(z) \\\\) without any distortion?",
  "Explanation": "The Fourier Transform maps the function from the time to the frequency domain. The process can distort certain properties (e.g., time-localization of information in \\\\( f(z) \\\\)) unless attributes such as absolute integrability are met by \\\\( f(z) \\\\). Some properties might be preserved like energy or bandwidth under specific conditions but not universally.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Matrix A → Complex Variable z; Complex Variable z → Function f(z); Function f(z) → Fourier Transform → F(w); Fourier Transform → Properties of F(w); Properties of F(w) → Distortion; Properties of f(z) → Distortion"
