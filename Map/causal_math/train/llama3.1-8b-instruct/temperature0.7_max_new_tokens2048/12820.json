  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, governed by \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We evaluate the effects of a Fourier transform defined by \\\\( f(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i \\omega t} z(t) dt \\\\) on z(t).\n\nIf the Fourier transform \\\\( f(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) starting from t = 0 and evolves naturally under \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = By \\\\) without any external intervention, will the Fourier transform of z(t) at t = T differ from that of the initial conditions directly evolved to t = T?",
  "Explanation": "The application of the Fourier transform does not alter the physical evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\), it only provides a transformation into the frequency domain. The dynamics governed by A and B remain unaffected by the Fourier transform itself, hence the spectrum at t = T should depend only on these dynamics and initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
