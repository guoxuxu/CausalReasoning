  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{(iA + B)t} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) represents the imaginary unit, and A and B are real constants. This function is used to transform the initial complex number \\\\( z_0 \\\\). We investigate how an integral transformation \\\\( I(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} e^{-(iA + B)t} z(t) dt \\\\) affects the output over a period T.\n\nCan the original parameters A and B be precisely concluded from the output of \\\\( I(z) \\\\) after applying \\\\( f(t, z) \\\\), based only on the integral outcome at T?",
  "Explanation": "The compound effect of the transformations involving A, B, C, and D makes it intrinsically difficult to disentangle and pinpoint the original parameters A and B. The overlapping effects and the integral's nature covering the entire interval mask specific contributions, preventing accurate back-calculation of A and B solely from the final output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
