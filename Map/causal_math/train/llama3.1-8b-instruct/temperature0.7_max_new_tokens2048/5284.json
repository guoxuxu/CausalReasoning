  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions of time t, and i is the imaginary unit. We explore the effects of applying a Laplace Transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\) to this function, defined as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\{z(t)\\\\} = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number.\n\nGiven the Laplace Transform of a function post-intervention (derivative operation), can we establish whether only the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\), only the derivative, or both were used to obtain this transformed result?",
  "Explanation": "The resulting Laplace Transform after applying a derivative can produce similar transformations to different combinations of original functions and operations applied to them. Without explicit knowledge of the intervention or initial conditions, one cannot distinguish between these possibilities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
