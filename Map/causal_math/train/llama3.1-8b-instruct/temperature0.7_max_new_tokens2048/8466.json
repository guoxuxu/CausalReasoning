  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolving under a system driven by differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{u} = Mu \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{v} = Nv \\\\), where M and N are constant matrices. An integral transform \\\\( T[w] = \\\\int_0^T e^{-At} w(t) dt \\\\) with a constant matrix A is applied to study the dynamics.\n\nGiven the result of \\\\( T[z] \\\\) at T, can we infer the specific initial conditions \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "The outcome of the integral transform \\\\( T[z] \\\\) involves integration over both u and v functions, which evolve based on their distinct dynamics governed by M and N. Without knowing the specific behavior of the differential equations or additional conditions, it's impossible to uniquely determine \\\\( z(0) \\\\) from \\\\( T[z] \\\\) at T alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
