  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), evolving over time t according to the differential equation \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = iz \\\\). We investigate whether the application of a Fourier transform affects the interpretation or evolution of the function.\n\nGiven the Fourier-transformed output at time T, can we accurately infer the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) without knowing whether the Fourier transform was initially applied?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing how the data has been transformed (whether the Fourier transformation was applied), we cannot accurately backtrack to identify the original function reliably. The transformation from time domain to frequency domain is not inherently reversible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
