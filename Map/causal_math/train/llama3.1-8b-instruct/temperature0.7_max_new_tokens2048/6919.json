  "Problem": "Consider a function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) defined in the complex plane, which represents a rotation as a function of time. Analyze how the Laplace Transform (denoted as \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}\\\\)) of this function, given by \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}(z(t))(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st}e^{it} \\\\, dt \\), affects the original function's behavior under various conditions.\n\nIf at a specific instant the function is modified by an additional rotational operation \\\\( f(t) = e^{kt} \\\\) where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant, and then a Laplace Transform is applied, will the resulting function depend solely on the original transformation?",
  "Explanation": "The additional application of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) before applying the Laplace Transform adjusts the function’s behavior by adding another frequency component. This results in compounded effects in the Laplace domain, making the outcome dependent on both the original function and the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
