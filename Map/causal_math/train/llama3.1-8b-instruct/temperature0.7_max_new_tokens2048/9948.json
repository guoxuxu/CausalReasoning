  "Problem": "Consider a continuous-time system described by a complex valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\), where \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) evolves according to the linear partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial t} = i\\\\omega z \\\\), with \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) being a real constant. Examine the impact of an integral transformation given by \\\\( g(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-st}z(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is a complex constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine exactly which transformations were applied (whether \\\\( g(z) \\\\), \\\\( h(z) \\\\), or both), solely based on the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The potential for different sequences and types of transformations (integral and differential), along with their inherent dependencies on complex constants \\\\( s \\\\) and \\\\( k \\\\), leads to multiple possible trajectories that could result in the same endpoint. This non-unique relationship prevents the precise determination of the applied transformations based only on the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
