  "Problem": "Analyze the relationship between the input and output of an integral transform with kernel function \\\\( K(t,s) = e^{A(t-s)} \\\\), where A is a square matrix. The input function is \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and the output function is defined by \\\\( y(t) = \\\\int_0^T K(t,s)x(s) ds \\\\). Here T is a constant and the transformation is observed up to time T.\n\nIs it possible to reconstruct function \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) without knowing the matrix A used in the kernel function?",
  "Explanation": "Reconstructing \\\\( x(t) \\\\) from \\\\( y(t) \\\\) with no knowledge of A is not feasible because the kernel function \\\\( K(t,s) = e^{A(t-s)} \\\\) contains critical information that defines how input is transformed into output. Without A, the transformation relationship is undefined, making backward calculation to find \\\\( x(t) \\\\) infeasible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
