  "Problem": "Consider the integral transformation \\\\( F(s) = \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\\\) where \\\\( f(t) \\\\) is a function of time. We examine the effect of multiplying \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) is a constant, on the Laplace transform.\n\nIf the multiplication of \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) is applied, and then the function is transformed with the Laplace Transform, will \\\\( F(s) \\\\) shift to \\\\( F(s - \\\\alpha) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The multiplication by \\\\( e^{\\\\alpha t} \\\\) results in a new function, \\\\( g(t) = e^{\\\\alpha t} f(t) \\\\). The Laplace Transform of \\\\( g(t) \\\\) is \\\\( F(s - \\\\alpha) \\\\), which is a shifted version of \\\\( F(s) \\\\). This shows a direct causal effect of the multiplication on the transform, translating \\\\( s \\\\) by \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
