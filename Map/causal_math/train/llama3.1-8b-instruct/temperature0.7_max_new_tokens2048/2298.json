  "Problem": "Analyze a Fourier Transform scenario where a function \\\\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\\\) is transformed into its Fourier counterpart \\\\( F(\\\\omega) \\\\) and affected by a convolution with a Gaussian kernel \\\\( g(x) = e^{-a x^2} \\\\) where \\\\( a \\\\) is a positive constant.\n\nAfter observing the final state by either method described above, can we accurately determine whether the convolution was performed in the frequency domain or the spatial domain?",
  "Explanation": "Due to the convolution theorem and the reversible properties of the Fourier transform, the end result of the convolution does not retain information about the domain in which the convolution was performed. Both methods are mathematically equivalent and lead to indistinguishable outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Fourier Transform of f(x) → F(ω); Gaussian kernel → Convolution with F(ω); Convolution with F(ω) → Output in Frequency Domain; Convolution with F(ω) → Output in Spatial Domain; Output in Frequency Domain → Observable State; Output in Spatial Domain → Observable State; Observable State → Determination of Domain; Observable State → Determination of Domain → No"
