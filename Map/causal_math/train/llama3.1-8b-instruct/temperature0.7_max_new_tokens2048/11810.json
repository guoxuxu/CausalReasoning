  "Problem": "Consider a complex function defined as \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\) where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( t \\\\) represents time. Analyze the response of the function under an integral transformation \\\\( T \\\\) defined by \\\\( T[f](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{s} f(s) ds \\\\).\n\nIf an intervention modifies \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to \\\\( z(t) = e^{(i+c)t} \\\\) at a time \\\\( t = t_1 \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a real constant, will the outcome \\\\( T[z](T) \\\\) for \\\\( T > t_1 \\\\) reflect the effects of both \\\\( e^{it} \\\\) and the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the behavior of the function from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) onward, affecting its growth rate and oscillatory nature due to the additional real exponential component. This alters the integral outcome from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to \\\\( T \\\\), indicating a causal relationship that includes both the original function and the effect of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
