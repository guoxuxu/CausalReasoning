  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit and \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are functions of time described by the differential equations \\\\(\\\\dot{x} = Ax\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\dot{y} = By\\\\), respectively, with A and B being constant matrices. We analyze the effect of a Laplace Transform applied to this system.\n\nCan we deduce the initial functions \\\\( x(0) \\\\) and \\\\( y(0) \\\\) after observing the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\) at some future time t = T without knowing the initial form of \\\\( z(t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Given the transformed function \\\\( Z(s) \\\\), and knowing the linearity and reversibility of the Laplace Transform, one can calculate \\\\( \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\\\{Z(s)\\\\} \\\\) to find the original time-domain functions \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\), and specifically their initial states at t = 0.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
