  "Problem": "Analyze a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = Lu \\\\) representing heat flow in a medium where L is a differential operator. We look at the effect of applying an integral transform \\\\( T(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-s^2x} u(x,t) dx \\\\) during the evolution.\n\nAssuming an intervention with a different integral transform \\\\( R(u) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{-kx^2} u(x,t) dx \\\\) (where k is a constant) is applied at some time t_1 > 0, does the nature of the state at t = T solely reflect the impact of operator L and not the transforms T or R?",
  "Explanation": "Both transformations \\\\( T(u) \\\\) and \\\\( R(u) \\\\) influence the state's evolution by altering the initial and intermediate spatial distribution of heat. This effect combines with the dynamics imposed by L, affecting the end-state at t = T.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
