  "Problem": "Consider the linear integro-differential equation governing a system: \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x) \\\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty g(x, t) y(t) dt \\\\), where \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) are known functions. We're investigating the effects of applying a Fourier transform \\\\( \\\\mathcal{F} \\\\) on \\\\( y(x) \\\\) and then studying the system's behavior under transformations.\n\nCan we deduce the original function \\\\( y(x) \\\\) from the transformed state \\\\( Y(X) \\\\) after time \\\\( t \\\\) without knowing the form of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) or \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Lacking knowledge of \\\\( p(x) \\\\) and \\\\( g(x, t) \\\\) within an integro-differential setup complicates back-calculating to \\\\( y(x) \\\\). The transformation and the evolution distort the pathway from effect to cause, and without precise knowledge of the operational functions, reconstruction of \\\\( y(x) \\\\) is indeterminate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
