  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation on a function space, described by the integral transform \\\\(T[f](x) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} K(x, s)f(s) ds\\\\), where \\\\(K(x, s)\\\\) is the kernel function. We examine the transformation's behavior when the function \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}\\\\) is introduced, and how adding a multiplication by \\\\(e^{as}\\\\) as an intervention affects transformations.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\(f(s) = e^{-s^2}\\\\) is transformed via \\\\(T\\\\), and then allowed to evolve under its transformation rule without further intervention, will the outcome \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\) be the same as directly calculating \\\\(T[f](x)\\\\) with no initial alterations?",
  "Explanation": "The operation is a direct transformation of \\\\(f\\\\) by \\\\(T\\\\), without any modification to the function or the kernel in the transformation process. Thus, this direct application will yield the expected result as defined by the integral transform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
