  "Problem": "Consider a linear transformation in a vector space involving a matrix \\\\( P \\\\) representing a projection operator onto a subspace. Let us explore the changes in vectors under the operations defined by another matrix \\\\( Q \\\\), where \\\\( Q \\\\) is an orthogonal matrix representing a rotation.\n\nIf a vector \\\\( v \\\\) is first projected by \\\\( P \\\\) and then rotated by \\\\( Q \\\\), will the final vector be the same as rotating the vector first and then projecting it?",
  "Explanation": "Because projection and rotation are generally non-commutative operations, the order in which they are applied affects the resulting vector. Specifically, a projection reduces the vector's dimensionality, potentially changing aspects that are preserved or altered by the subsequent rotation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
