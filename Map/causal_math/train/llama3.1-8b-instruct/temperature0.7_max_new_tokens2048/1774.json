  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) that evolves over time t according to the system \\\\( \\\\dot{z} = Cz \\\\), where C is a constant complex number. We analyze the effect of applying the integral transformation \\\\( H(z) = \\\\int e^{St}z dt \\\\), where S is another constant complex number.\n\nGiven the observed transformed state at t = T, can we uniquely determine the initial function \\\\( z(0) \\\\) if we do not know whether \\\\( H(z) \\\\) was applied at t = 0?",
  "Explanation": "Without knowing the application time of \\\\( H(z) \\\\), the resulting function at t = T after integrating can differ significantly due to varying contributions from S over different durations. This makes it impossible to trace back to \\\\( z(0) \\\\) uniquely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
