  "Problem": "Imagine a system governed by the Laplace Transform, \\\\( L(f)(s) \\\\) of a function \\\\( f(t) \\\\. We apply the Laplace Transform to the exponential growth function \\\\( f(t) = e^{at} \\\\), where \\\\( a \\\\) is a real constant. We then examine how an intervention using the Fourier Transform, \\\\( F(g)(\\\\omega) \\\\), affects the transformed function \\\\( f(t) \\\\).\n\nIf at a specific time, we apply a Fourier Transform to \\\\( f(t) \\\\) as an intervention before applying the Laplace Transform, will the resulting Laplace spectrum be independent of the Fourier Transform parameters?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention using the Fourier Transformer modifies \\\\( f(t) \\\\) by altering its frequency components, resulting in a transformation that is influenced by both the nature of the original function and the parameters of the Fourier Transform. Thus, the resulting Laplace spectrum is dependent on these changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
