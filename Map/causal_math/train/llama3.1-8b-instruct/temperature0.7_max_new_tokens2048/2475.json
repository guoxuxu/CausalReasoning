  "Problem": "Analyze a complex system where the rate of growth of a population \\\\( p \\\\) is governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dp}{dt} = p^2 \\\\), representing unrestricted quadratic growth. We consider alterations to this model through a transformation function \\\\( h(p) = p e^{-kt} \\\\), where \\\\( k \\\\) is a constant decay factor.\n\nIf at some time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), an intervention \\\\( m(p) = p e^{rt} \\\\) (where \\\\( r \\\\) is a new rate constant) is applied, will the population \\\\( p(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on the original quadratic growth without considering the effects of \\\\( k \\\\) or \\\\( r \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the intervention \\\\( m(p) \\\\) with a new growth factor \\\\( r \\\\) adds a new dimension to the population growth dynamics. The population at any time T > t_1 will thus be influenced by the effects of both decay rate \\\\( k \\\\) and the new rate \\\\( r \\\\) due to the compounded effects of these transformations, indicating a dependency on all factors (initial quadratic growth, \\\\( k \\\\), and \\\\( r \\\\)).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
