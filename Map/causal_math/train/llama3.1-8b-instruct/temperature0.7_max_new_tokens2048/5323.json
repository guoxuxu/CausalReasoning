  "Problem": "Consider a system expressed by the linear transformation \\\\( T(x) = Ax \\\\) where \\\\( A \\\\) is a constant matrix. We explore the effect of an additional functional transformation \\\\( g(x) = Ux \\\\), where \\\\( U \\\\) is a unitary matrix, on the eigenvalues of the vector \\\\( x \\\\).\n\nIf at a certain time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new function \\\\( h(x) = Vx \\\\) (where \\\\( V \\\\) is another unitary matrix) is applied as an intervention, will the eigenvalues of the endpoint \\\\( x(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on \\\\( A \\\\) and not on \\\\( U \\\\) or \\\\( V \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Unitary transformations such as \\\\( U \\\\) and \\\\( V \\\\) preserve eigenvalues; therefore, despite the application of these transformations, the eigenvalues of the system at any time depend only on \\\\( A \\\\), which determines how the space is fundamentally mapped by \\\\( T \\\\).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "T → x; U → x; V → x; A → x(T); U → x(T); V → x(T); A → eigenvalues; x(T) → eigenvalues"
