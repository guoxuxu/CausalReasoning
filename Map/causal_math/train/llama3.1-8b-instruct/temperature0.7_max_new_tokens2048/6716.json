  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where \\\\( A \\\\) is a real constant, and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex number. We explore the impact of applying a linear transformation \\\\( f(z) = Cz \\\\), where \\\\( C \\\\) is a complex constant, at different points in time.\n\nGiven the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\), can we determine which transformations were executed (whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both), by solely observing \\\\( z(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\) cannot unequivocally reveal whether \\\\( f(z) \\\\), \\\\( g(z) \\\\), or both were applied, due to potential equivalence in the resultant state from different sequences of transformations. Both \\\\( C \\\\) and \\\\( D \\\\) could yield similar or indistinguishable outcomes when applied at different stages or in different orders.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
