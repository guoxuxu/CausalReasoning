  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output, \\\\( z(t) \\\\), is derived from the input, \\\\( x(t) \\\\), via a complex function and an integral transformation defined by \\\\( z(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}Bx(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau \\\\), where A and B are matrices and \\\\( e^{At} \\\\) denotes the matrix exponential.\n\nCan we establish the precise initial input signal, \\\\( x(0) \\\\), by solely examining the output, \\\\( z(T) \\\\), at some time T without further knowledge about the input's evolution over time?",
  "Explanation": "The output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is a cumulative function of all past values of the input, integrated with a transformation factor \\\\( e^{A(t-\\\\tau)}B \\\\). Without additional temporal details about the input, deducing \\\\( x(0) \\\\) just from \\\\( z(T) \\\\) is underdetermined as multiple input profiles could lead to the same output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
