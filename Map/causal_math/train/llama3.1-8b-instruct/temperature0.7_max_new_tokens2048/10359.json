  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\\\) where \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( y(t) \\\\) are real functions governed by the coupled differential equations \\\\( \\\\dot{x} = Ax - By \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\dot{y} = Bx + Ay \\\\). A transformation is defined by \\\\( f(z) = e^{i \\\\omega t}z \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a constant.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a new transformation \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i \\\\omega t}z \\\\) is applied as an intervention, will the endpoint \\\\( z(T) \\\\) for T > t_1 depend only on A and B but not on \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) = e^{-i \\\\omega t}z \\\\) at \\\\( t_1 \\\\) adds another phase shift, countering or amplifying the effect of the original transformation \\\\( f(z) \\\\). The final state of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will be influenced by \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) in addition to A and B, reflecting the cumulative phase alterations and their interaction with the dynamical system.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
