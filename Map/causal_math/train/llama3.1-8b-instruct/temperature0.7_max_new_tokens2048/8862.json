  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is a constant frequency. We examine the impact of an integral transformation defined by \\\\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(\\tau)d\\tau \\\\).\n\nGiven the transformed function \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\), can we revert to the original function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) at any time t without knowing \\\\( \\omega \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "To invert the transformation \\\\( T(z)(T) \\\\) back to \\\\( z(t) \\\\), knowledge of the parameter \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is essential, since it defines the original function. Without this parameter, the original function cannot be precisely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
