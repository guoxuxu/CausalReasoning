  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z: \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\) governed by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\\\), where A is a real number and \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is the initial complex value. Examine the effect of a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z + e^{iBt} \\\\), where B is another real number, applied at time t.\n\nIf the transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z_0 \\\\) at t = 0 and then allowed to evolve under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z \\\\) without further intervention, will the value of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if \\\\( z_0 \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( g(z) \\\\) alters the initial condition by adding \\\\( e^{iBt} \\\\) at t = 0, which modifies the trajectory from its original path. As a result, \\\\( z(T) \\\\) will reflect this altered initial condition, leading to a different final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
