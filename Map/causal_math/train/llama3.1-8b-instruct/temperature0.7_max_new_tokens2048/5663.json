  "Problem": "We explore the impact of a differential operator \\\\( L \\\\) applied on a function \\\\( g(x) \\\\). Here, \\\\( L \\\\) is a linear operator and we define it as \\\\( L(g(x)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\\\), where s is a complex number. The differential operator serves as an integral transformation of the function, possibly altering its domain and behavior.\n\nIf a function \\\\( g(x) = e^x \\\\) is first transformed by \\\\( L \\\\), and later an intervention modifies \\\\( g(x) \\\\) to \\\\( h(x) = x^2 \\\\) before applying \\\\( L \\\\) again, will the final outcome depend only on the last applied function \\\\( h(x) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final state of the system after multiple transformations and interventions (transforming \\\\( e^x \\\\) followed by transforming \\\\( x^2 \\\\)) depends on both the transformations and the functions involved due to the compounding effect of the two different transformations, thus not solely on the final function applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
