  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( f(z) = e^z \\\\) and its effect on a region in the complex plane under the transformation defined by the integral \\\\( F(z) = \\\\int_{0}^{z} e^t dt \\\\). Analyze the impact of this function over different paths in the complex plane.\n\nCan we deduce whether an intervention changed the path at \\\\\\\\(( z_1 \\\\\\\\)) given the observed value of \\\\\\\\(( F(z) \\\\\\\\)) at \\\\\\\\(( z \\\\\\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "If there is evidence of a non-standard increment due to multiples of \\\\\\\\(( 2\\\\pi i \\\\\\\\)) in the value of \\\\\\\\(( F(z) \\\\\\\\)), it strongly suggests that the path was altered to encircle the origin one or more times. This alteration would be an essential clue indicating an intervention that changed the path significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
