  "Problem": "Examine a system described by the partial differential equation \\\\(\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = L(u)\\\\), where L is a linear differential operator. We investigate how the application of the Laplace transform, denoted as \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\), affects the system's evaluation over time.\n\nIf an intervention by applying another transform, say the Fourier transform \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\), is done at time \\\\(t_1\\\\) to the function \\\\(u(t_1)\\\\) evolved under the original PDE, and then continued to evolve under \\\\(L(u)\\\\), will the final state at time T depend solely on the linear differential operator L and not on the Laplace or Fourier transforms?",
  "Explanation": "Introduction of a Fourier transform as an intervention modifies the state in a new domain, adding complexity to how the subsequent evolution occurs under L. The end state at time T will be influenced by how both \\\\(\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\) alter the dynamics in their respective transform domains, along with the direct influence of L.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
