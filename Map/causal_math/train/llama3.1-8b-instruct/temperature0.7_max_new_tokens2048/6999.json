  "Problem": "Consider a system described by the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{it} \\\\), which traces out a unit circle in the complex plane over time. Analyze the effects of the integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^t z(s) ds \\\\) on this system.\n\nIf at time \\\\( t_1 \\\\), a function modification \\\\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\\\) is applied, and then \\\\( T(z) \\\\) is calculated continuously from 0 to T, does the output at time T depend solely on the initial function (\\\\( e^{it} \\\\))?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the trajectory of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) to a new function, which will affect the integral transformation from \\\\( t_1 \\\\) to T. Thus, the result of \\\\( T(z) \\\\) at time T will be influenced by both the pre-intervention and post-intervention function forms, reflecting the compositional impact on the integrated outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
