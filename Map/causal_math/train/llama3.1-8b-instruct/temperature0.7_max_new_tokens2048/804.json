  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the partial differential equation \\\\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\\\) that describes heat diffusion in a rod. We investigate the effect of an initial condition transformation defined by \\\\( g(u) = u + e^{w x} \\\\), where w is a constant.\n\nGiven the endpoint temperature profile \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\), can we determine precisely what interventions were used (whether \\\\( g(u) \\\\), \\\\( h(u) \\\\), or both), solely by knowing the result at \\\\( u(x, T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "Different combinations of transformations and their parameters (\\\\( w \\\\) in \\\\( g(u) \\\\) and \\\\( w \\\\) in \\\\( h(u) \\\\)) can yield the same final profile under the heat equation due to their overlapping effects and potentially balancing alterations of the temperature profile. Thus, the exact nature of interventions cannot be deduced uniquely from the endpoint profile alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The transformation g(u) directly causes the endpoint temperature profile, as it is the only intervention that directly influences the endpoint temperature profile."
