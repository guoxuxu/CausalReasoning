  "Problem": "Consider a system governed by the complex function \\\\( w(z) = e^{z} \\\\), where z is a complex variable. The analysis focuses on the consequences of integral transformations such as the Laplace transform on the time behavior of this system.\n\nCan we correctly reconstruct the original function \\\\( w(z) \\\\) at any point by solely observing its transformation at time \\\\( t = T \\\\) under the initial conditions without knowing it underwent a Laplace transform?",
  "Explanation": "Information about whether a transformation like the Laplace transform was applied is crucial because the transform could have theoretically altered certain attributes or details about timing or scaling that are not observable just from the end behavior without this context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
