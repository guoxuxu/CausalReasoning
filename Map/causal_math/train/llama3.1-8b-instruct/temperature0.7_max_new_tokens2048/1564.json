  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit consisting of resistors, inductors, and capacitors governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\\\alpha \\\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\\\beta v = 0 \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\) are constants. We explore the influence of an input signal transformation defined by \\\\( g(v) = e^{st}v \\\\) where s is a complex constant, investigating its effect over time t.\n\nGiven the observed voltage \\\\( v(T) \\\\) at the end, can we pinpoint exactly which transformations (whether \\\\( g(v) \\\\), \\\\( h(v) \\\\), or none) were applied during t = 0 to T, using only the outcome \\\\( v(T) \\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The final observed voltage \\\\( v(T) \\\\) may result from different sequences or combinations of interventions due to the complex interplay of the exponential transformations. Variations in s or k, either alone or combined, overlap in potential impacts on the circuit's dynamics, rendering clear identification of the specific interventions applied impractical based solely on the final state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
