  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\\\( \\omega \\) is a constant scalar and \\\\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. We study the effect of the Laplace transform on this function over time interval \\\\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\nIf a derivative operation, as an intervention, is applied after calculating the Laplace transform, and the function is then inverse-transformed back to the time domain, does this process affect the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the resulting function?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a derivative operation in the Laplace domain, represented as multiplication by \\\\( s \\\\), followed by the inverse Laplace transform, will alter the magnitude and possibly the phase of the function, but does not inherently change the frequency \\\\( \\omega \\\\) of the resulting function, which is a defining characteristic of the original time-domain function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
