  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\\\omega z + k \\\\), where \\\\( i \\\\) is the imaginary unit, \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\) is a real number representing angular frequency, and \\\\( k \\\\) is a complex constant. We explore the system's response under an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int_0^T e^{-i\\\\omega t}z(t)\\\\, dt \\\\), applied over a time interval from 0 to T.\n\nGiven the outcome of the transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) over the interval [0, T], can we precisely determine the nature of any interventions (such as changes to \\\\( k \\\\)) applied during this interval?",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( T(z) \\\\) cumulatively integrates the system's response over time, blending influences from any intrinsic dynamical changes and interventions. Since the integral aggregates effects non-uniquely and various combinations of \\\\( \\\\Delta k \\\\) and initial conditions could yield similar results, pinpointing exact interventions from \\\\( T(z) \\\\) alone is not feasible.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
