  "Problem": "Analyze the impact of performing a sequence of linear transformations and then applying a Laplace Transform L on a function g(t), where g(t) = e^(At)x for a constant matrix A and an initial vector x.\n\nIf g(t) is defined as e^(At)x and transformed using L to L{g(t)}, with no other operations applied, will L{g(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * x if no initial operations are performed on x?",
  "Explanation": "When g(t) = e^(At)x, the Laplace Transform of g(t) naturally results in L{g(t)} = (sI - A)^-1 * x due to the definition and properties of the Laplace Transform applied to exponential functions involving matrices, which conforms to the transform of g(t) directly without modifications to x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
