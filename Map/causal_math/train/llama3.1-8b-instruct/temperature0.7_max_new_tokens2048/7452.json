  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit where the output voltage \\\\( V(t) \\\\) across a capacitor depends on the input current \\\\( I(t) \\\\) according to the integral transformation \\\\( V(t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{-(t-s)/RC} I(s) \\\\, ds \\\\), where R and C are constants representing the resistance and capacitance, respectively.\n\nBy knowing the output voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) and the times of intervention, can we accurately deduce the exact changes made to \\\\( I(t) \\\\) at those interventions?",
  "Explanation": "The output voltage \\\\( V(T) \\\\) is a result of a complex integration over the entire history of input currents adjusted by the exponential decay factor, making it difficult to exactly pinpoint the nature and extent of changes made to \\\\( I(t) \\\\) merely based on the final output voltage. There are potentially many different input histories that could result in the same output due to the mathematical properties of integral transformations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
