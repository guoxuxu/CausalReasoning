  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\\\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\\\), where P is a complex constant. Evaluate the effects of applying an integral transformation \\\\( T(z) = \\\\int e^{Qt}z(t) \\\\, dt \\\\) where Q is another complex constant.\n\nGiven the final state \\\\( z(T) \\\\), and knowing that transformations \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and/or \\\\( S(z) \\\\) might have been applied, can we determine exactly what transformations took place based on the knowledge of \\\\( z(T) \\\\) alone?",
  "Explanation": "The final state at \\\\( z(T) \\\\) could be achieved through various combinations or sequences of applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) and \\\\( S(z) \\\\). The inherent complexity in unraveling integrated and derived transformations without additional temporal details prevents unambiguous delineation of the specific transformations applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
