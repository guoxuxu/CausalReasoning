  "Problem": "Consider a continuous function \\\\( z(t) \\\\) governed by the differential equation \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + \\\\sin(t)\\\\), where M is a constant matrix. An integral transformation defined by the operator \\\\( T[z](t) = \\\\int_0^t e^{M(t-s)}z(s)ds \\\\) is used to investigate causal relationships.\n\nIf the operator \\\\( T \\\\) is applied to \\\\( z(t) \\\\) at t = 0 and allowed to evolve under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + \\\\sin(t)\\\\) without further intervention, will the output \\\\( z(T) \\\\) at t = T be the same as if the original \\\\( z(t) \\\\) was directly evolved to t = T under \\\\(\\\\dot{z} = Mz + \\\\sin(t)\\\\)?",
  "Explanation": "The operator \\\\( T \\\\) modifies the initial condition through an integral transformation, impacting the evolution path of \\\\( z(t) \\\\). Depending on the interaction between \\\\( M \\\\) and the integrated effect, the resultant state at time T can diverge from the original trajectory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
