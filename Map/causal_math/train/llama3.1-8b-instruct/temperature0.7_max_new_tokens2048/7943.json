  "Problem": "Consider a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions of time, evolving according to the linear differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\), respectively. A Laplace transform is applied to both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), creating a transformed function \\( Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s) \\).\n\nIf at a time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention alters \\( x(t) \\) to \\( x'(t) = Dx(t) \\) where D is a constant, will \\( Z(s) \\) depend solely on \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), irrespective of \\( D \\)?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies \\( x(t) \\) to \\( x'(t) \\), changing its subsequent trajectory and thus affecting the Laplace transform \\( X(s) \\). This change in \\( X(s) \\) in turn alters \\( Z(s) \\). Therefore, \\( Z(s) \\) will depend not only on \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) but also significantly on \\( D \\).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
