  "Explanation": "A reduction in total_salary could be due to either a decrease in base_salary or the removal of a bonus, or even a reduction in the bonus_rate. Thus, a decreased total_salary cannot conclusively infer the removal of a bonus without knowing more details about the changes in base_salary or bonus_rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
