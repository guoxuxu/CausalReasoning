  "Problem": "def calculate_health_index(age, weight, exercise_freq):\n    if age > 50:\n        health_index = 70\n    else:\n        health_index = 80\n    health_index -= weight//20\n    if exercise_freq > 3:\n        health_index += 10\n    else:\n        health_index -= 5\n    return health_index\",\n\nCould a low health index imply a high age?",
  "Explanation": "The base health index for individuals over 50 is lower at 70 compared to 80 for those under 50. Thus, observing a lower health index could imply a higher age, although factors like weight and exercise frequency can modify the index.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
