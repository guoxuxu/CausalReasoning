  "Problem": "def compute_final_score(base_score, bonus, penalty, high_score_bonus_enabled):\n    if base_score > 90 and high_score_bonus_enabled:\n        bonus += 20\n    final_score = base_score + bonus - penalty\n    if final_score > 100:\n        final_score = 100\n    return final_score\",\n\nIf final_score equals 100, can we conclude that high_score_bonus_enabled was True?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, reaching a final_score of 100 could be due to a combination of a high base_score and bonus, irrespective of the high_score_bonus. The cap at 100 is applied regardless of how it is achieved, and high_score_bonus_enabled being True is one of several paths to reach 100.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the high_score_bonus_enabled condition is met, the base score influences the bonus, which in turn affects the final score, leading to a maximum final score of 100."
