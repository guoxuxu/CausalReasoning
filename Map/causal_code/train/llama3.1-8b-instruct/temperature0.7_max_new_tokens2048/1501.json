  "Problem": "class Employee { constructor(name, isManager) { this.name = name; this.isManager = isManager; this.salary = isManager ? 5000 : 3000; } updateSalary(increment) { if (this.isManager) { this.salary += increment * 1.2; } else { this.salary += increment; } } reportIssue() { if (!this.isManager) { return 'issue reported'; } else { return 'resolve issue directly'; } } }\",\n\nIf an employee receives an increment, will this change the salary differently based on whether they are a manager?",
  "Explanation": "According to the `updateSalary` method, managers and non-managers receive different increment calculations for their salary increases. Managers have their increments multiplied by 1.2, indicating a higher final increment compared to non-managers who receive the increment as is.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
