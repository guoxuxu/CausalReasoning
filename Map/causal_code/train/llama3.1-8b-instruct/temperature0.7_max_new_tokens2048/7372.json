  "Explanation": "Moderate growth results from watering with a half liter as per the given functions, but this is not an exclusive scenario. The setup in the plant_growth function highlights moderate growth specifically tied to 'water with half a liter', but doesn't exclude other unmentioned factors or interventions that could produce similar growth outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
