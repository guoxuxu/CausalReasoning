  "Explanation": "Changes in `average_outcome_A` can indicate changes in `group_A_treatment_effect` because it is one of the major contributing factors of `group_A_outcome`. An observed change in the outcome might suggest a variation in the treatment effect, although other factors like age and random noise could also play a role.",
