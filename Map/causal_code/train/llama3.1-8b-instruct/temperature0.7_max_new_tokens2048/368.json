  "Explanation": "The condition 'Cloudy' is determined by not fitting any other condition: not hot enough for 'Thunderstorm' or 'Sunny', and not wet enough for 'Rainy'. Thus, a change to 'Cloudy' doesn’t guarantee that the temperature is at or below 20; it might also be due to low humidity and a temperature above 20.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
