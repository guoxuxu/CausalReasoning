  "Explanation": "The decrease in sales_adjusted observed after manipulating sales to decrease might solely be due to the reduction in the sales component of the sales_adjusted formula. The original price does not necessarily have to be above 50, as the lowering of sales alone is enough to reduce sales_adjusted.",
