  "Problem": "Above Python Code\",\n\nIf it's observed that carnivore population declines, and we intervene by increasing herbivore population artificially, will the plant growth rate influence the original decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by increasing the herbivore population aims to bolster the carnivore population by providing more food. The original plant growth rate that may have influenced the decrease in carnivores becomes less relevant as herbivore numbers are artificially boosted.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
