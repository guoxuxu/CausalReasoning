  "Problem": "Python code above\",\n\nIf a user's preferred genre matches the movie's genre, will the recommendation likely be positive without any past user ratings?",
  "Explanation": "The code sets a base score of 8 (out of 10) when the user's preferred genre matches the movie's genre. Since a score of 7 or higher is needed for a recommendation, and 8 is already above this threshold, it is likely that the movie will be recommended.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
