  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(prices, is_member, promo_code):\n    discount_rate = 0.05 if is_member else 0.0\n    if promo_code == 'SAVE20':\n        discount_rate += 0.2\n    return [price * (1 - discount_rate) for price in prices]\",\n\nIf promo_code is set to 'SAVE20', will the prices for all items in the list always be reduced by at least 20%?",
  "Explanation": "Setting promo_code to 'SAVE20' adds 0.2 to the discount_rate, but the final discount percentage applied to the prices depends on the initial value of discount_rate. If the customer is not a member ('is_member' is False), the initial rate is 0.0, and hence with 'SAVE20', the total discount rate will be 0.2, which is a 20% discount, not at least 20%.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
