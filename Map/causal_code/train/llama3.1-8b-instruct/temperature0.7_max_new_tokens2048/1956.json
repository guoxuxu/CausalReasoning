  "Explanation": "Increasing `temp_outside` to make it equal or greater than `desired_temp` and then manually turning off the heater aligns with the system logic; if `temp_outside` is at least `desired_temp`, then there is no need for the heater to be on.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
