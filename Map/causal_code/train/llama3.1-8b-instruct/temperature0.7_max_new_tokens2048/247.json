  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, stock, replenish):\n    for item, sold in sales.items():\n        if item in stock:\n            stock[item] -= sold\n            if stock[item] < 5:\n                if item in replenish:\n                    stock[item] += replenish[item]\n    return stock\",\n\nIf we increase the quantity in the replenish dictionary for an item, will it directly influence the final stock of that item?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by increasing the replenishment quantity directly impacts the stock levels of that item in the case that pre-existing stock drops below 5, thereby increasing the final stock level of the item. This aligns with the cause (replenishment increase) to the effect (increased final stock).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
