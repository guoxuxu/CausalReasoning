  "Explanation": "Increasing 'num_logins' manually without altering the 'sum_purchases' leads to a higher denominator in the 'average_purchase' calculation. This means, without an increase in 'sum_purchases', the 'average_purchase' will decrease, assuming the same purchasing behavior.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
