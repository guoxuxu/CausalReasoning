  "Problem": "{\n    \"code\": \"class Initializer { int counter; Initializer() { counter = 0; } void increment() { counter += 1; } boolean isEven() { return counter % 2 == 0; } } Initializer init = new Initializer(); init.increment(); boolean result = init.isEven();\"\n  },\n\nIf `isEven()` returns false, was `increment()` called an odd number of times?",
  "Explanation": "The method `isEven()` returns false only when `counter % 2` is not equal to 0, indicating that `counter` is odd. Since the `counter` starts at 0 (an even number) and `increment()` changes it by 1 each time, an odd number of calls would leave it odd.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
