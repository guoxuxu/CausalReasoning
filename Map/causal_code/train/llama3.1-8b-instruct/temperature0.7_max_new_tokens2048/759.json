  "Explanation": "Although increasing regulation_strictness would improve environment_health, an observed improvement could also merely be due to a reduction in pollution_level. Without knowledge of specific interventions, the cause of the improvement remains uncertain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
