  "Problem": "def update_stock(prices, sales, delivery):\n  stock = { 'apples': 100, 'bananas': 120, 'oranges': 90 }\n  for item in sales:\n    if item in stock:\n      stock[item] -= sales[item]\n  for item in delivery:\n    if item in stock:\n      stock[item] += delivery[item]\n  for item, price in prices.items():\n    if price < 0.5 and stock[item] > 100:\n      sales[item] = stock[item] - 100 \n  return stock\",\n\nCan a high final stock count imply low sales activity without considering delivery and price?",
  "Explanation": "A higher stock count can suggest that there were lower sales, provided deliveries and prices remain unchanged, as sales decrease the stock.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
