  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  min_val = min(data)\n  max_val = max(data)\n  normalized_data = [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in data]\n  return normalized_data\n\ndata_set = [15, 22, 35, 9, 56]\nnormalized_set = process_data(data_set)\",\n\nIf we adjust the process_data function to add a fixed amount to each data item in data_set before normalization, will this change the distribution of values in normalized_set?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a fixed amount to each element in data_set will change both min_val and max_val equally, thus preserving the relative distances and resulting in no change in the distribution of values in normalized_set after normalization.",
