  "Explanation": "Given the 'result' is 'high', 'adjusted' must be greater than 20. Reverse-calculating from 'adjusted' = 'original' * 1.1 + 2 > 20 gives 'original' > 16.36. Thus, 'original' must have been greater than approximately 16.36.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
