  "Problem": "public class WeatherSystem {\n    private WeatherService weatherService;\n    private NotificationService notificationService;\n\n    public WeatherSystem(WeatherService service, NotificationService notifier) {\n        this.weatherService = service;\n        this.notificationService = notifier;\n    }\n\n    public void notifyWeatherConditions() {\n        String weather = weatherService.getWeather();\n        if (weather.equals(\"Stormy\")) {\n            notificationService.sendAlert(\"Warning: Storm approaching!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf we observe that no alerts are being sent, can we conclude the weather is not 'Stormy'?",
  "Explanation": "Under the assumption that the system is functioning correctly and that the intervention (or lack thereof) hasn't disabled the NotificationService, the absence of alerts strongly implies that the weather condition is not 'Stormy'. However, we should be cautious as theoretically, unreported service malfunctions could influence this outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
