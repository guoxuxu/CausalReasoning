  "Explanation": "In the provided code, the only place where the inventory count decreases is within the 'sell_item' method. When it is called with an item and that item's inventory is sufficient, it reduces the inventory of that item. Thus, if the inventory of apples decreases, it suggests the 'sell_item' method was used with 'apple' as the argument.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
