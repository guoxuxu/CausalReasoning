  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    if flag > 0:\n        result = sum(data) + 10\n    else:\n        result = sum(data) - 5\n    return result\n\ndata_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nflag_value = 3\noutput = process_data(data_list, flag_value)\",\n\nDoes changing the value in data_list affect the output?",
  "Explanation": "The function 'process_data' calculates the sum of 'data_list'. Any change in the values within 'data_list' directly changes the sum, and consequently, alters the 'result', which is the output. This is an example of 'from cause to effect without intervention' as we are examining how changes in the input data list affect the output without modifying any other part of the program flow.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
