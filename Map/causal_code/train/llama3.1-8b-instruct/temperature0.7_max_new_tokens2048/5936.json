  "Explanation": "A poor grade ('D') can result from low attendance combined with low study hours, but not low attendance alone. A low attendance student still has opportunity to achieve a higher grade ('B') if study hours are sufficiently high (>5 hours). So, a direct causation of poor grade by low attendance alone isn't accurate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
