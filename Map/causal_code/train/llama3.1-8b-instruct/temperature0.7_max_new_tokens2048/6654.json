  "Explanation": "The method applyExtraDiscount modifies the discountRate property of the class. Since the method calculateDiscountedRevenue relies on both averageSales (from calculateAverageSales method) and discountRate to calculate its result, changing the discountRate will influence the final discounted revenue calculated.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
