  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(temp, pressure, altitude):\n    weather_rating = 'good' if temp > 20 and pressure > 1010 else 'bad'\n    safety_check = 'passed' if altitude < 5000 and weather_rating == 'good' else 'failed'\n    return {\n        'weather_rating': weather_rating,\n        'safety_check': safety_check\n    }\n\nmetrics = compute_metrics(25, 1020, 4500)\",\n\nCan manipulating the altitude help us infer the original temperature?",
  "Explanation": "Manipulating the altitude influences the safety check but does not provide direct information about the temperature. The altitude affects only the safety check condition and has no causal link to the temperature; thus, altering it won't help infer the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
