  "Explanation": "Lowering the start point of 'thresholds' might impact the elements discarded by the filter condition in 'process_data', but it does not necessarily increase the minimum value of 'cleaned_data' used in the calculation of 'average'. 'cleaned_data' will still contain all elements greater than the respective threshold, which could still be lower than before if the new threshold is lesser than the smallest data point in the list.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
