  "Explanation": "The result of the withdraw method (True or False) indicates whether the operation was successful or not but cannot provide the exact amount of the starting balance since multiple initial balances can lead to the same operation result depending on the withdrawal amount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
