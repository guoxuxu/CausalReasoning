  "Explanation": "As per the function, persons older than 50 have a lower base health index of 70, compared to 90 for those 50 or younger. Thus, as age increases beyond 50, the `health_index` decreases due to the reduced base value, assuming other factors (diet_quality and exercise_freq) remain constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
