  "Explanation": "Even with an intervention that stops people from carrying umbrellas, we cannot definitively infer that it's not raining since the decision to carry an umbrella is contingent not just on rain, but also on temperature being less than 20 degrees.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
