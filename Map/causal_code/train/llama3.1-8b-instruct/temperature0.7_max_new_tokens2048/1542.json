  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, coupon_code):\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == 'SAVE20':\n        discount = 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == 'OFF10':\n        discount = 0.1\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nAssuming the presence of a price modifier that increases the price by 30%, could a reduced final price suggest the usage of the 'SAVE20' coupon code?",
  "Explanation": "A reduction in the final price despite the price increase could imply a significant discount such as the 20% from 'SAVE20', especially if the reduction proportion is great enough to offset the increased initial price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
