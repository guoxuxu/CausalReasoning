  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'age' in data: \n        data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n    if 'income' in data and data['is_adult']:\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'high' if data['income'] > 50000 else 'low'\n    return data\",\n\nWould directly setting 'is_adult' to True in the data affect the 'tax_bracket' assignment when 'income' is above 50000?",
  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting 'is_adult' to True, regardless of the 'age' data, the condition checks in the 'tax_bracket' assignment section will now only depend on the 'income'. If 'income' exceeds 50000, 'tax_bracket' will accordingly be set to 'high'. This intervention bypasses the age check and directly influences the outcome based on income.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
