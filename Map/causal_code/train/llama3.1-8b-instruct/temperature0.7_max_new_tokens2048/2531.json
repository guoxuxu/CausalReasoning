  "Explanation": "According to the original code, when a person's age exceeds 50, the healthScore is reduced by 30 points in the updateHealthScore function, which is automatically called in the constructor when an instance is created. Increasing the age from 49 to 51 crosses this threshold, thus triggering the decrease.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
