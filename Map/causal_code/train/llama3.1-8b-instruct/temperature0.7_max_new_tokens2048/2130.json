  "Explanation": "If the intervention causes it to rain, we must have set the temperature below 20 degrees and increased the humidity above 50 as they are necessary preconditions for rain to occur in the system defined by the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
