  "Explanation": "An intervention that changes `yellow_light_duration` to less than 5 directly affects the condition `return self.yellow_light_duration < 5` within the `is_safe_to_cross` method, changing the output from `False` to `True` when the color is yellow.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
