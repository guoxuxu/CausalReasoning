  "Explanation": "Increasing temperature will likely lead to sunnier weather (due to the is_sunny method in the Weather class). As the Mood class checks if the weather is sunny to determine happiness, a sunnier weather results in a happier mood, which in turn leads the Productivity class to conclude a higher likelihood of being productive.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
