  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, customer_type):\n    base_discount = 0.1 if customer_type == 'loyal' else 0\n    seasonal_discount = 0.05 if price > 100 else 0\n    total_discount = base_discount + seasonal_discount\n    discounted_price = price - (price * total_discount)\n    return discounted_price\",\n\nBy observing a lower discounted price, can we conclude the customer is 'loyal'?",
  "Explanation": "A lower discounted price can also result from a higher initial price leading to a seasonal discount, independent of the customer being 'loyal'. Therefore, observing a lower discounted price alone does not conclusively indicate that the customer is 'loyal'.",
