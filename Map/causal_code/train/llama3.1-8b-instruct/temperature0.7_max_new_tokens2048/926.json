  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_value, use_filter=True):\n    if use_filter:\n        filtered_data = [d for d in data if d > filter_value]\n    else:\n        filtered_data = data\n    result = sum(filtered_data) / len(filtered_data)\n    return result\",\n\nIf you set 'filter_value' to a higher value during the function call, will it affect the resulting 'result'?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'filter_value' means only higher data points above the new filter_value are included in 'filtered_data' when 'use_filter' is True. Consequently, the average calculated from potentially fewer and higher-valued data points tends to be higher. Thus, manipulating 'filter_value' will influence the output 'result'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
