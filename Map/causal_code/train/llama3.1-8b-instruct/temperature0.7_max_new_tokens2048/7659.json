  "Explanation": "Directly setting 'multiplied' to exceed 20 creates a scenario where the 'status' becomes 'high' irrespective of the original 'value'. This is an example of an intervention disrupting the normal cause-effect flow inside the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
