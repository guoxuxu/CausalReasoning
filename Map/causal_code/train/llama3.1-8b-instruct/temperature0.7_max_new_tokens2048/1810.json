  "Explanation": "Low productivity can result from either high stress levels or poor air quality, and high stress can result from high temperatures or other undefined variables. Furthermore, poor air quality, which can cause low productivity, is not directly related to temperature but to the air quality index. Therefore, observing low productivity does not necessarily imply that the temperature was high.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
