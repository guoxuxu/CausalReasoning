  "Explanation": "The only scenario where 'final_revenue' is exactly equal to the sum of 'sales_figures' under the defined operations in 'process_sales_data' is when 'total_tax' is 0, which occurs if 'tax_percentage' is zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
