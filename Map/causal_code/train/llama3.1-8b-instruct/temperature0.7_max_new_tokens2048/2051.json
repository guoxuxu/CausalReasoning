  "Explanation": "Resetting steps to 0 during an active state triggers 'adjust_heart_rate'. As steps_count influences the heart rate calculation in 'adjust_heart_rate', resetting steps affects the heart rate which will return to 80 from it's prevailing value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
