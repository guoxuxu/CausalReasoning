  "Explanation": "A 'High' result indicates that 'total_cost' exceeded 1000. While this suggests that the product of 'quantity' and 'adjusted_price' (which includes the 10% increase from 'price') is high, it doesn't necessarily mean both were high individually. A high 'price' with a moderate 'quantity' or vice versa could also result in crossing the 'High' threshold.",
