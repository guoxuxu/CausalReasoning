  "Explanation": "Observing the heater turned off cannot confirm that temperature was manually decreased using decreaseTemperature(). The heater can be off while the temperature remains constant or the temperature could have been altered through other means outside of the current system's method (like environmental changes). Thus, heater status being off alone cannot be used to causally infer a manual decrease in temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
