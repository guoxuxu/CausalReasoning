  "Problem": "class CommercialBuilding { int rent; int bill; bool popular_area; int num_tenant(int guests) { this.rent += 50; if(guests > 100 || popular_area) { bill += guests * 2; return guests; } else { return guests / 2; } } void adjust_rent_and_bill(bool economic_crisis) { if(economic_crisis) { rent -= 100; bill += 50; } else { rent += 100; bill -= 20; } }}\",\n\nIf a decrease in the bill is observed, can we conclude that the area has become less popular?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in the bill could be either due to a reduction as a form of adjustment in non-crisis times (bill reduced by 20) or other factors not defined in the code such as fewer guests, rather than just changes in area popularity. There is no direct causal relationship from bill decrease to area's popularity as described in the original code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
