  "Explanation": "The 'withdraw' method first checks if the amount is greater than the account balance. Since the balance (after previous transactions) is 1300, withdrawing 1200 would leave a balance of 100, hence the 'Insufficient balance' message will not appear.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
