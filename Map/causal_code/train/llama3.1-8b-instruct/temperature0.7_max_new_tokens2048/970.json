  "Explanation": "This seeks to test causal inference from cause to effect with an intervention. Increasing detrimental environmental impacts will reduce health more before any treatment can be applied, thus resulting in lower final health.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
