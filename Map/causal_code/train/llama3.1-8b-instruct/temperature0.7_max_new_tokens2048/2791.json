  "Explanation": "The heaterStatus being 'on' does not provide enough information to deduce the specific change in temperature as the actual control of temperature, either increase or decrease, is done through separately triggered methods (increaseTemperature, decreaseTemperature). The status 'on' indicates that the system is ready to affect temperature but does not inherently specify how much or when the temperature has changed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
