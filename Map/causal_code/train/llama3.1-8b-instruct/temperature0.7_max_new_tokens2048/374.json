  "Explanation": "Based on the predict_precipitation method, the prediction of 'rain' occurs when the temperature is 0 or above and the humidity is above 80. Hence, the observed 'rain' can be linked causally to the temperature being above 0 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
