  "Explanation": "Increasing the budget increases the promotion effectiveness only under certain conditions (e.g., budget and season requirements). While higher promotion effectiveness can lead to higher sales, there are other factors, such as competition, that affect final sales. Hence, increasing the budget does not always increase sales.",
