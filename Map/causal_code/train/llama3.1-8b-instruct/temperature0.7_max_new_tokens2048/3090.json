  "Explanation": "The risk_factor is calculated as `age_squared` times 0.05 plus `smoker` times 2. Since `age_squared` is the square of `age`, increasing age will result in a higher `age_squared`, and consequently, a higher risk factor. This occurs without any other intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
