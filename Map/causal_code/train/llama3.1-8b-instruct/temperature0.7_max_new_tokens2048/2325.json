  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 10 degrees via changeTemperature method will make isRaining true as per the condition in the method, which triggers rain when the temperature falls below or equals 15 degrees.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
