  "Explanation": "With no discount (0%) applied, two special products each priced at $150 total up to $300. This output is exactly $300, not less, before any other potential application of the cumulative discount over $500.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
