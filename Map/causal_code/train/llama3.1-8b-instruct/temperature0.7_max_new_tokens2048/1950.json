  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n\\tfiltered_data = filter(lambda x: x['age'] > 30, data)\n\\tprocessed_data = [d for d in filtered_data if d['income'] > 50000]\n\\tfor item in processed_data:\n\\t\\tif item['education'] == 'College':\n\\t\\t\\titem['status'] = 'Approved'\n\\t\\telse:\n\\t\\t\\titem['status'] = 'Pending Review'\n\\treturn processed_data\",\n\nIf the list `processed_data` changes, does it imply the list `data` has changed?",
  "Explanation": "Changes in `processed_data` might be due to internal processing steps independent of changes in `data` (such as different filtering logic for 'age' or 'income' in the code). Thus, changes in `processed_data` do not necessarily imply changes in the original `data` list.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
