  "Explanation": "The only scenario under the provided code where 'Out of fuel!' is returned is when drive() is called with fuel_level at 0, which can happen after repeated drive() calls depleting the fuel.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
