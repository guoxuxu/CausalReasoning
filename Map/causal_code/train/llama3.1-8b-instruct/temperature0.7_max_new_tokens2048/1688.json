  "Problem": "def compute_sales(discount, quantity, base_price):\n\\tif discount > 0:\n\\t\\tfinal_price = base_price * (1 - discount / 100)\n\\telse:\n\\t\\tfinal_price = base_price\n\\ttotal_sales = final_price * quantity\n\\tsurplus = total_sales * 0.05\n\\treturn total_sales, surplus\n\nsales, extra = compute_sales(10, 50, 20)\",\n\nDoes a reduction in total sales imply that the discount went up?",
  "Explanation": "A reduction in total sales could be due to numerous factors including reduced quantity sold, changes in base price, or other market conditions. Not necessarily only because of an increase in discount. This is a reverse causality question ignoring multi-causal influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
