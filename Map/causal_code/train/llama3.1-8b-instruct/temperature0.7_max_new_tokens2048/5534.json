  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount, holiday):\n    if holiday:\n        discount += 0.1\n    final_price = base_price * (1 - discount)\n    tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate\n    total_cost = final_price + tax_amount\n    return total_cost\",\n\nIf you observe a decrease in 'total_cost', and it's known that there was an intervention altering the 'tax_rate', can this be taken as evidence of an original increase in the 'base_price'?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'total_cost' caused by an intervention in the 'tax_rate' (e.g., a reduction) does not necessarily imply that there was an increase in the 'base_price'. The 'total_cost' is influenced by multiple factors such as 'final_price' (which includes 'base_price' and 'discount') and the 'tax_amount'. Decreased 'total_cost' could result from the decrease in 'tax_rate' or other factors like 'discount', without any change in 'base_price'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
