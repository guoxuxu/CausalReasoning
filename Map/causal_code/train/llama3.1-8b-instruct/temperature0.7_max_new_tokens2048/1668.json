  "Explanation": "Doubling the `data` can shift the result from False to True or keep it unchanged, depending on the original value of `data`. For instance, if initial `data` is 30, multiplying by 2 will result in 60 (and thus `False`), but if the data is already 51, doubling leads to 102, thus the resultant `True`.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
