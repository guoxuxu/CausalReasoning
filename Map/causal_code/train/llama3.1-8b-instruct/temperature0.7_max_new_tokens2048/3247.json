  "Explanation": "Although the air conditioning turns on when the temperature exceeds 25 degrees, but turning on the air conditioning does not necessarily imply the system reached this temperature organically. External interventions could manually activate the air conditioning, or previous conditions might have changed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
