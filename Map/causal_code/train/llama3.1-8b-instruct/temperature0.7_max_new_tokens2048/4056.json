  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'price' in data:\n        data['discount'] = data['price'] * 0.90\n    data['final_amount'] = data['discount'] * 1.15\n    return data\",\n\nIf we were to apply a different discount formula (e.g., 85% instead of 90%), will this always result in a lower final amount compared to using the original discount, assuming the price is identical?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the discount rate from 90% to 85% while keeping the price the same will naturally result in a lower discount amount. Since the final amount is calculated as 1.15 times the discount, reducing the discount will consistently reduce the final amount as calculated by this formula, assuming no other changes in the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
