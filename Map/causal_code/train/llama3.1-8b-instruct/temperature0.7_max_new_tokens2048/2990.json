  "Explanation": "Increasing temperature does not necessarily lead to an increase in forecasted_sales due to the combined impact of both temperature and the corresponding discount_rate on sales. While high temperature tends to increase the base_sales, the discount rate applied does not increase linearly above 80 degrees, affecting the final calculation differently.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
