  "Explanation": "The increase in price could occur due to two reasons: either the demand is greater than 100 and no discount is applied, or it could just be a scenario where no changes were made to the demand (i.e., it might be lesser than or equal to 100 but the base price was high). This question explores the effect-to-cause inference without intervention, which is not definitively implied by the code.",
