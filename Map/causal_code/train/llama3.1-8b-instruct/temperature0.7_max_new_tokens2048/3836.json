  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code=None):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == '10OFF' else 0.05 if coupon_code == '5OFF' else 0\n    discount = total * discount_rate\n    total_after_discount = total - discount\n    return total_after_discount\",\n\nIf a '5OFF' coupon is applied, will the total_after_discount always be less than the total before discount?",
  "Explanation": "The coupon '5OFF' leads to a non-zero discount rate (5%). Applying this coupon code results in a computed non-zero discount amount, which when subtracted from the total, always reduces the total amount payable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
