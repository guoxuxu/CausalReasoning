  "Explanation": "Introducing or reintroducing items to sold_items does not reverse a decrement in the count; it only potentially triggers additional decrements. Since the decrement is not an invertible action by manipulation of the sold_items list post factum, introducing two 'apples' just causes further decrements.",
