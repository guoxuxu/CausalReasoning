  "Explanation": "Given the final total of $415 after subtracting $50 (implying the pre-discount total was at least $500), and utilizing a 20% discount on the special product, achieving such a total would generally require the inclusion of a higher discounted item like 'special product' to reach this pre-discount total quickly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
