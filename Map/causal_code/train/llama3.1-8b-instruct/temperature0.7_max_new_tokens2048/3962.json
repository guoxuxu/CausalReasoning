  "Explanation": "In the `predict_sales` function, sales are calculated as `base_sales + sensitivity / price`. An increase in `price` leads to a decrease in `sensitivity / price` term, directly causing a decrease in `predicted_sales`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
