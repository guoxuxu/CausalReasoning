  "Explanation": "A 'Healthy' status means the health_score is above 50, but this could result from various combinations of diet and exercise. For instance, a person might have an unhealthy diet but compensates with strong adherence to exercise, pushing the health_score above 50. Hence, we cannot conclusively determine the diet based on the health status alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
