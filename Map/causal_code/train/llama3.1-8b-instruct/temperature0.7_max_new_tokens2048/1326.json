  "Explanation": "It isn't feasible to determine the amount deposited based solely on the change in the result of a withdraw method, as multiple deposit amounts can lead from an unsuccessful to a successful withdrawal depending on previous balance and withdrawal request.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
