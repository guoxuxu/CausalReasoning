  "Explanation": "Since tasks can only be added (and thus increase the task count) when the system is ready, a non-zero task count implies that the system must have been initialized (`systemReady` set to true) at some point. The reset system sets `systemReady` to false and task count to zero, so a non-zero task count implies initialization.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
