  "Explanation": "While the purchase method does decrease stock quantity when called, decrease in stock quantity could also result from other actions like spoilage or manual adjustment not shown in the code. Thus, decrease in stock does not definitively indicate that the purchase method was called.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
