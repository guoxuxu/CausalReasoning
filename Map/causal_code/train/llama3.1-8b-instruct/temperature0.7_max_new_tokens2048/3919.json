  "Explanation": "The code sets higher scholarships for younger age groups. If a student has a higher scholarship, it can be inferred that they belong to a younger category, as the cause (age) determines the effect (scholarship) directly through the predefined age brackets.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
