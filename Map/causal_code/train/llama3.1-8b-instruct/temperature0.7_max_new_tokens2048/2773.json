  "Explanation": "While observing a specific decrease in 'total' indicates a discount was applied, it cannot definitively tell which specific code was used between 'SAVE10' or 'SAVE20' without additional information. Both codes decrease the total amount, but the exact discount value can be similar for different quantities of goods purchased, or different original base prices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
