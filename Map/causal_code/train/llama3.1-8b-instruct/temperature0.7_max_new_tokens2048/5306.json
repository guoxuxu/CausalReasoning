  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(prices, status, season):\n    if status == 'VIP':\n        base_discount = 0.2\n    else:\n        base_discount = 0.05\n\n    if season == 'holiday':\n        seasonal_discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        seasonal_discount = 0.03\n\n    total_discount = base_discount + seasonal_discount\n    discounted_prices = [price * (1 - total_discount) for price in prices]\n    return discounted_prices\",\n\nIf an external factor, such as a supplier lowering overall prices, leads to decreased product prices, would it then be correct to assume the status of the customer or the season is impacted?",
  "Explanation": "A supplier's decision to lower prices is independent of a customer's status (e.g., VIP or regular) and the current season (e.g., holiday or not). Therefore, reduced prices due to lower supplier prices should not lead us to infer changes in customer status or seasonal discounts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
