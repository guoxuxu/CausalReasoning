  "Problem": "def process_data(input_list):\n    modified_list = [x * 2 for x in input_list]\n    final_sum = sum(modified_list)\n    if final_sum > 100:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    return result\n\ndata = [10, 20, 30]\noutput = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf the `input_list` is doubled in size, will the `result` potentially change?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the elements in `input_list` causes `modified_list` to increase, which can raise `final_sum` above 100, changing `result` to True if it was previously False, or remain True.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
