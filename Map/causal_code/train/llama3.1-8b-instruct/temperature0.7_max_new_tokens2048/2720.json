  "Explanation": "Although changing the parameters in drink_water affects hydration, it does not interfere with the energetic state. Since is_energetic is set when daily_calories_burned exceeds 500 via the exercise method, adjusting parameters to exercise can still lead to is_energetic being true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
