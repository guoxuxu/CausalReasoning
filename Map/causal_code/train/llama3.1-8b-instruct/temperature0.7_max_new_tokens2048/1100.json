  "Explanation": "The condition for setting 'company_status' to 'Leading' is that 'max_sale' exceeds 100000. Hence, if 'company_status' is 'Leading', it necessarily implies that at least one sale (max_sale) was more than 100000, affecting the total sales significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
