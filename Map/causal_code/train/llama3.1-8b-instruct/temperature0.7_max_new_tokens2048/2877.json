  "Explanation": "Given that 'sales_total' is constant due to external intervention, any change in 'discounted_total' must be due to modifications in 'discount_rate'. This direct deduction from the effect back to a cause with intervention showcases the inverse causal impact under controlled conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
