  "Explanation": "Setting 'final_prices' to zero does not necessarily imply that 'coupon_value' has been changed. This could occur through intervention in the code that directly alters 'final_prices' or changes to the input prices array; thus we cannot deduce changes to 'coupon_value' without further information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
