  "Problem": "class WeatherStation {\n  int temperature; \n  boolean isRaining; \n  int humidityLevel;\n\n  public WeatherStation(int temperature, boolean isRaining, int humidityLevel) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.isRaining = isRaining;\n    this.humidityLevel = humidityLevel;\n  }\n\n  public boolean willRainSoon() {\n    if (this.humidityLevel > 85 && this.temperature < 20) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  public void increaseHumidity(int increment) {\n    this.humidityLevel += increment;\n  }\n\n  public void adjustTemperature(boolean increase) {\n    if (increase) {\n      this.temperature += 5;\n    } else {\n      this.temperature -= 5;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the temperature drops without altering the humidity, can this induce rain according to the code?",
  "Explanation": "According to the `willRainSoon` method, rain is predicted when humidity is above 85 and the temperature is below 20. A drop in temperature below 20 with unchanged humidity above 85 triggers predicted rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
