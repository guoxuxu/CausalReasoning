  "Explanation": "Given that the function 'set_environment' solely bases the environmental condition on the temperature being above or below 20, a 'warm' environment necessarily implies that the temperature was indeed above 20.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
