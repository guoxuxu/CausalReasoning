  "Problem": "class SalesPredictor:\\\n    def __init__(self, historical_sales, economic_index):\\\n        self.historical_sales = historical_sales\\\n        self.economic_index = economic_index\\\n\\\n    def predict_sales(self, marketing_spend):\\\n        base_sales = sum(self.historical_sales) / len(self.historical_sales)\\\n        economic_effect = self.economic_index * 1.5\\\n        marketing_effect = marketing_spend * 0.3\\\n        future_sales = base_sales + economic_effect + marketing_effect\\\n        return future_sales\",\n\nIf an intervention sets marketing_spend to a higher value, will this likely result in an increase in future_sales?",
  "Explanation": "The 'predict_sales' method includes a calculation where 'marketing_spend' directly contributes to 'future_sales' through 'marketing_effect'. Increasing 'marketing_spend' increases the 'marketing_effect' and thus 'future_sales'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
