  "Explanation": "According to the code, the message 'Snowing because it is cold and raining.' is printed when both conditions of raining and the temperature being below 0 degrees Celsius are met. Thus, setting the temperature to -3 during rain enables both conditions, leading to this specific output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
