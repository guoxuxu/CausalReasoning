  "Problem": "def compute_final_price(base_price, tax, discount, apply_discount_first):\n    if apply_discount_first:\n        final_price = (base_price - discount) * (1 + tax)\n    else:\n        final_price = base_price * (1 + tax) - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we intervene by setting `apply_discount_first` to True, will an increase in `tax` still result in a higher `final_price` compared to not intervening?",
  "Explanation": "With intervention, setting `apply_discount_first` to True changes the order of operations such that the discount reduces the taxable amount. Despite this, an increase in `tax` will still increase the `final_price` as the product of a reduced base (after discount) with a higher tax rate still results in an overall increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
