  "Explanation": "Setting the 'total' manually to 500 intervenes and overwrites any effect the 'condition' or the initial values might have had. Any causal link from 'condition' to 'total' is severed by this intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
