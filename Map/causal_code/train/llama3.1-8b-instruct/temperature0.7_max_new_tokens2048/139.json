  "Explanation": "Reducing a patient's weight leads directly to a reduced BMI, given that height remains constant. This drop in BMI could move the patient from a higher to a lower risk category (e.g., from 'High' to 'Moderate' or even to 'Low'), according to the BMI thresholds set in the code under 'health_risk' function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
