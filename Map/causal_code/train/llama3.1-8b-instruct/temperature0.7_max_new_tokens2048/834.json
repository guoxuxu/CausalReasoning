  "Problem": "class Experiment { int temp; double reactionRate; void increaseTemp() { temp += 5; if (temp > 100) reactionRate *= 2; else reactionRate += 10; } void decreaseReaction() { if (reactionRate > 20) { reactionRate -= 5; temp -= 3; } } }\",\n\nIf an external method sets the temperature exactly to 105, will the reaction rate double?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 105 explicitly meets the condition in the 'increaseTemp()' method where the temperature exceeding 100 leads to the reaction rate being doubled. As this is a direct condition in the code, intervening to set the temperature to 105 will result in doubling the reaction rate as per the logic defined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
