  "Explanation": "Even though setting 'user_score' to 70 would result in a 'status' of 'high', achieving a 'high' status does not imply that the 'user_score' was exactly 70 before changing. The original 'user_score' could have been any number that, once 10 is added, results in a score higher than 75.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
