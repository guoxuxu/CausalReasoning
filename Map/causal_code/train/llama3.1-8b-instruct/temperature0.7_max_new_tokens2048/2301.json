  "Explanation": "Setting production hours to zero means no production occurs at all. Therefore, no additional pollution will be generated from production during that time. However, the overall pollution level might still change due to other ongoing environmental factors or decay.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
