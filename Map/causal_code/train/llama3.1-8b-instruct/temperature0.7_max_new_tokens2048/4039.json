  "Problem": "def calculate_profit(revenue, costs, tax_rate): \n    profit_before_tax = revenue - costs \n    tax = profit_before_tax * tax_rate \n    profit_after_tax = profit_before_tax - tax \n    return profit_after_tax\",\n\nIf profit_after_tax decreased, did revenue necessarily decrease?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in profit_after_tax can be caused by either a decrease in revenue, an increase in costs, or both. Additionally, changes in tax_rate could also affect the profit_after_tax. Therefore, it is not certain that a decrease in profit_after_tax is solely caused by a decrease in revenue; other factors might be influencing the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
