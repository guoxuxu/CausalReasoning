  "Explanation": "The current_temp could become high due to high ambient temperature because the current_temp changes based on 10% of the ambient_temp if the heater is off. Thus, a high current_temp does not necessarily indicate that the heater has been on, but could also be due to high ambient temperatures.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
