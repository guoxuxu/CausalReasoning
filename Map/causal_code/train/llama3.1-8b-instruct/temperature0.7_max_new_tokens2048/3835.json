  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code=None):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == '10OFF' else 0.05 if coupon_code == '5OFF' else 0\n    discount = total * discount_rate\n    total_after_discount = total - discount\n    return total_after_discount\",\n\nIf the total cost before discount appears high, can we infer coupon_code was '10OFF'?",
  "Explanation": "A high total cost before discounts simply reflects the sum of products of 'price' and 'quantity' of the items. It does not inherently indicate the usage of any particular coupon code, as the coupon code affects only the discount rate and subsequently the total cost after discount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
