  "Explanation": "A high healthRiskScore can result from either being a smoker or being older, as the risk score is computed by multiplying the age by 1.5 and adding 50 if the person is a smoker. Individuals could have a score over 100 purely based on their age, without being smokers.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
