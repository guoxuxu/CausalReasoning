  "Explanation": "The total price, calculated in the 'getTotalPrice' method, sums up the price of all products in the list. Since each product's price can be directly modified by methods within the class (such as when a discount rate is changed and applied), any such change will directly affect the total price computation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
