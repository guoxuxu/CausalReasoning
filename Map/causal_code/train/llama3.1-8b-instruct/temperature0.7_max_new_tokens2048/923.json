  "Explanation": "No, because 'isHeating' being false can also be a result of 'currentTemperature' being initially set to a value equal or higher than 'setTemperature' prior to the external method call or the method may not have changed the temperature at all (e.g., only checking the temperature). Thus, without additional information regarding what the external method does, we cannot causally infer that it affected the temperature to meet or exceed 'setTemperature'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
