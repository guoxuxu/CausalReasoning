  "Explanation": "Without intervention, observing a traffic speed of 30 km/h implies high traffic density (greater than 50). According to the code, this speed is set only if it is not a holiday and `trafficDensity` is 50 or higher, following the `else` condition in `calculateTrafficSpeed()` method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
