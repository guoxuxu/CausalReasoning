  "Explanation": "While toggling the heater on can cause a 5-degree increase in temperature, the same temperature change could also occur from an increase in the external temperature if neither the AC nor the heater is on. Therefore, a 5-degree increase in system temperature does not necessarily mean the heater was toggled.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
