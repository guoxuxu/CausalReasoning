  "Explanation": "Charging the battery (intervention) directly affects the `batteryLevel`. When `batteryLevel` is set above 20, `isFunctional` is set to true. Thus, this intervention on the cause (battery charge) directly ensures the effect (robot functionality).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
