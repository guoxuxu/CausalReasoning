  "Explanation": "Performance is a function of systemLoad, not directly of debugMode status. High performance indicates that systemLoad is 50 or below. However, this could be achieved through other adjustments or inherently low load, without necessarily changing the debugMode. Thus manually setting performance to high doesn’t predicate the changing of debugMode status, showing the causal disconnect in the scenario of altering effect to expect changes in cause with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
