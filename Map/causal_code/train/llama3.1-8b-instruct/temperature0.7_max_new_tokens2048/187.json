A function then decides an activity based on the weather forecast.\"\n  },\n\nIf an artificial cooler is used to reduce the temperature to below 20, will it change the forecast to 'Sunny'?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by using an artificial cooler to lower the temperature below 20 alters the conditions evaluated in the forecast method of the Weather class, which would then return 'Sunny' instead of 'Rainy'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
