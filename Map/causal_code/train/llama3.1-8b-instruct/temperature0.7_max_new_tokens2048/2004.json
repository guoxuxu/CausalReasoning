  "Explanation": "With the intervention where you ensure all customers are happy (by perhaps ensuring high service quality), and subsequently observing only happy customers, it implies the service quality must have been above 7. This is the only scenario in the given code that guarantees happiness.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
