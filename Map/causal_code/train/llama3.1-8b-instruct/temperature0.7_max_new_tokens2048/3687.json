  "Explanation": "If all data elements are positive, the 'filter' will not change the dataset (as it only filters out non-positive numbers). The sums would be the same, except that in the 'no_filter' case it would be multiplied by 0.5, hence, actually, changing from 'no_filter' to 'filter' would typically increase the result unless all data points are zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
