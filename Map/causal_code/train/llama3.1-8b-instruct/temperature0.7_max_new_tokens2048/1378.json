  "Problem": "class Thermostat {\n  private int temperature;\n  private boolean power;\n\n  public Thermostat() {\n    temperature = 22; // Default room temperature in Celsius\n    power = false; // Thermostat is initially turned off\n  }\n\n  public void turnPowerOn() {\n    power = true;\n  }\n\n  public void turnPowerOff() {\n    power = false;\n  }\n\n  public void setTemperature(int newTemp) {\n    if (power) {\n      temperature = newTemp;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public boolean isPowerOn() {\n    return power;\n  }\n\n  public int getTemperature() {\n    return temperature;\n  }\n\n}\",\n\nUpon observing that the temperature is at the default setting, can we conclude that an external script turned on the power and then reset it?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature being at its default setting (22 degrees Celsius) could be due to multiple reasons other than an external script intervention. It could be a result of initial object construction or the thermostat might have been reset to default settings due to other internal logic or manual operations unrelated to the external script.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
