  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * demand * tax_rate \n    discounted_price = price - price * discount \n    total_revenue = discounted_price * demand + tax_amount \n    return total_revenue\",\n\nIf 'total_revenue' increases, can we deduce that 'demand' has increased, assuming no other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in 'total_revenue' might be due to various factors apart from an increase in 'demand'. Factors like a decrease in 'discount', an increase in 'price', or changes in 'tax_rate' could also result in increased 'total_revenue'. Without controlling for these variables, we cannot definitively attribute changes in 'total_revenue' directly to changes in 'demand'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If total_revenue increases, then it is likely that either demand, discount, price, or tax_rate has increased."
