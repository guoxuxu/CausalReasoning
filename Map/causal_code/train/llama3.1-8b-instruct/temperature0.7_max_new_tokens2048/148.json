  "Explanation": "Changing the 'evaluation' to 'high' is solely dependent on the 'score' being over 80 and does not affect the 'year' field. The 'year' and 'evaluation' fields are independent in this context under the conditions provided in the code, so intervening to change 'evaluation' does not alter the 'year'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
