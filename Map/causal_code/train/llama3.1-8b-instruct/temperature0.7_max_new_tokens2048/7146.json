  "Explanation": "A 'high' risk status suggests 'temp_status' was 'high' and the humidity was over 50. However, the temperature could also be exactly 100 or slightly less if there might be an error or edge case not handled in the initial condition as the code only checks for greater than 100.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the risk status is high, it suggests that the temperature was likely above 100, as a high temperature directly causes a high risk status, and a high temperature is a prerequisite for a high risk status."
