  "Explanation": "The change in policy raising the age requirement from 65 years to 75 years will affect the eligibility of a 70-year-old under the condition that they do not have insurance. Since the person's age of 70 no longer meets the new threshold, they will not be eligible solely based on their age and insurance status.",
