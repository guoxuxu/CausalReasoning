  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { constructor(temperature, humidity, windSpeed) { this.temperature = temperature; this.humidity = humidity; this.windSpeed = windSpeed; } forecastWeather() { if (this.temperature > 20) { if (this.humidity > 50) return 'rainy'; else return 'sunny'; } else if (this.windSpeed > 15) return 'stormy'; return 'cloudy'; } static interveneHumidity(weather, newHumidity) { weather.humidity = newHumidity; return weather.forecastWeather(); } }\",\n\nIf the temperature is over 20 degrees Celsius and humidity is initially below 50%, would the forecast be 'sunny' without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "According to the provided code, the weather condition relies on both temperature and humidity values. When the temperature exceeds 20 degrees and humidity is below 50%, the forecastWeather method declares the weather as 'sunny'. This follows directly from the logic in the method without requiring any external influence or intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
