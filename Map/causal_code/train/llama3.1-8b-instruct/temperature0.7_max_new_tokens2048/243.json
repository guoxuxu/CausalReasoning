  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_threshold=10):\n    filtered_data = [d for d in data if d > filter_threshold]\n    summary = sum(filtered_data)\n    return summary\n\ndata = [1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]\nresult = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf you manually add a high value (e.g., 100) to the data array, will the result be higher?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a high value like 100 to the data array and if it's above the filter threshold, it will be included in the filtered_data. Since the summary is just a sum of the filtered_data, adding a high value increases the overall sum, thus directly increasing the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
