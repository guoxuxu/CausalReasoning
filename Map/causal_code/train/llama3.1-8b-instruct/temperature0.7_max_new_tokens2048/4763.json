  "Explanation": "Although the `base_price` increase raises the `final_price`, the effect is modified by `apply_discount`, which recalculates the `final_price` by subtracting a discount calculated as a percentage of the increased `base_price`. Thus, the overall `final_price` may not necessarily increase proportionally depending on the discount percentage.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
