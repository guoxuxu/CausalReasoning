  "Explanation": "The code contains a mechanism to equalize the room temperature with environmental temperature over time (0.1 factor in natural temperature equalization). However, if the heater is on, the temperature might actually increase due to the heater's effect, overshadowing the drop in the external temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
