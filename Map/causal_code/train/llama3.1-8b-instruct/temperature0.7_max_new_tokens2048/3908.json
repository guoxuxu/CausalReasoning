  "Explanation": "Changing the discount condition to apply to items with quantities greater than 1 instead of 2 increases the frequency of discount application. This will likely reduce the final total cost since more items will now qualify for discounts.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
