  "Explanation": "The code directly assigns 'senior' to the status if the input age is greater than 30, assuming the age key exists in the data. There is no other condition affecting the status when the age is more than 30.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
