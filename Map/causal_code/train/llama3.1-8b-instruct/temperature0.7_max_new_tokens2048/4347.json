  "Problem": "def student_performance(height, study_hours, part_time_job):\n  stress_level = 0.4 * part_time_job\n  rest_quality = -0.3 * stress_level\n  study_efficiency = study_hours * (0.5 + 0.2 * rest_quality)\n  health = 0.6 * height - 0.5 * stress_level\n  performance = 0.3 * health + 0.7 * study_efficiency\n  return performance\n\n# Example invocation\nperformance = student_performance(170, 5, 1)\",\n\nIf rest quality is artificially enhanced using a hypothetical intervention, like better sleep quality aids, will this adjustment improve the student's study efficiency?",
  "Explanation": "Enhancing rest quality increases the modifier that boosts study_efficiency. Since study_efficiency directly contributes a major part to performance, improving rest quality through intervention will elevate study efficiency indirectly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Improving rest quality artificially can improve study efficiency, as it directly affects study efficiency and indirectly affects it by reducing stress level."
