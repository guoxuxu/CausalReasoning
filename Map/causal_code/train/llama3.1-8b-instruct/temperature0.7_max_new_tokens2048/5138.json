  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, customer_loyalty_years, holiday_season):\n    discount_rate = 0.05 if customer_loyalty_years > 3 else 0.02\n    if holiday_season:\n        discount_rate += 0.03\n    return price * (1 - discount_rate)\",\n\nIf we observe a lower discount value, can we intervene and affirmatively determine it was not a holiday season?",
  "Explanation": "The lower discount could also result from a lower number of loyalty years, which would outweigh the additional holiday season discount. So, observing lower values alone cannot definitely determine the holiday status without intervention or more data.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A lower holiday season is not the cause of a lower discount value, as customer loyalty years can also influence the discount rate, which in turn affects the discount value."
