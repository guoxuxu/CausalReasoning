  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, loyalty_program=False):\n    if loyalty_program:\n        discount *= 1.2\n    if discount > 30:\n        discount = 30\n    final_price = price * (100 - discount) / 100\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the 'final_price' observed is different from expected based on initial 'discount' and 'price', can this imply a change in the 'loyalty_program' status?",
  "Explanation": "A difference in final_price from what is calculated based on the original discount and price may suggest an intervention such as altering the loyalty_program status. Activation of the loyalty_program increases the effective discount leading to a lower than expected final_price if one only considered the base discount rate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
