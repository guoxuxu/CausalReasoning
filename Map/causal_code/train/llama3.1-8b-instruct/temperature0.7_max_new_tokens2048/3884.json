  "Explanation": "Setting penalty_points to zero means that during the execution of update_scores(), scores that typically get decremented (like those for team_b, which the code decrements by penalty_points), will not change due to penalties. Therefore, there will be no decrease due to penalties.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
