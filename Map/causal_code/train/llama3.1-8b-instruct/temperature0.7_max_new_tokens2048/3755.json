  "Explanation": "Taking supplements is directly factored into the calculation of health score in the updateHealthScore method, adding 10 points to the health score if supplements are taken. This demonstrates a direct causal relationship from the cause (taking supplements) to the effect (increase in health score).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
