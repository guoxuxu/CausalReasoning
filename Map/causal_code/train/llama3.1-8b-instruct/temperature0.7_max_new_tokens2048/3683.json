  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  adjusted_data = data ** 2\n  result = adjusted_data * 5\n  return result\n\nvalue = 10\nprocessed_value = process_data(value)\nprint(processed_value)\",\n\nCan a change in 'processed_value' imply a change in 'value' without accessing or modifying the 'process_data' function?",
  "Explanation": "A change in 'processed_value' implies that there was a change in 'value', as 'processed_value' is computed solely as a function of 'value'. Since 'processed_value' equals 5 times the square of 'value', any alteration in 'processed_value' suggests 'value' was altered, assuming the function itself remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
