  "Explanation": "If 'retry' is set to True and there is an 'error' indicated in the data, the status, which would have been set to 'FAIL' due to the error, will indeed be changed to 'RETRY'. The code explicitly modifies the status to 'RETRY' under these conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
