  "Problem": "def update_scores(scores, bonus, penalty, is_winner):\n    if is_winner:\n        new_scores = [score + bonus for score in scores]\n    else:\n        new_scores = [score - penalty if score > penalty else 0 for score in scores]\n    return new_scores\",\n\nIf after an intervention every element in 'new_scores' is greater than the original scores, was the intervention necessarily setting 'is_winner' to True?",
  "Explanation": "Although setting 'is_winner' to True will result in 'new_scores' being higher due to the addition of a bonus, the opposite isn't necessarily true. An increase in 'new_scores' could also be influenced by changes to 'scores' or 'bonus' instead of just the 'is_winner' variable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
