  "Explanation": "The code directly assigns a value of 100 to 'bonus_sales' if the discount_factor is greater than 0.5. This is a direct causal effect where increasing the discount_factor beyond 0.5 causes 'bonus_sales' to be set to 100 without requiring an intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
