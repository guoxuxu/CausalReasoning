  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'num_items' directly reduces 'adjusted_items' as it is computed based on 'num_items'. Since 'item_per_user' is calculated as 'adjusted_items' divided by 'adjusted_users', decreasing 'num_items' directly decreases 'item_per_user', assuming other factors (i.e., 'adjusted_users') remain constant.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
