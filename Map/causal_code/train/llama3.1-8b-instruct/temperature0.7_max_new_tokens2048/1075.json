  "Explanation": "Setting the promotion status to True does not directly imply that the sales figures were over 100000, as they could also be promoted due to having 'excellent' previous performance and sales figures above 50000 according to the code logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
