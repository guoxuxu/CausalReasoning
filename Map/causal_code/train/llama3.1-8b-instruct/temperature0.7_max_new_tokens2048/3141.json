  "Explanation": "While 'apply_discount' decreases price, a decrease in the price could be caused by other factors or interventions not included in the original code snippet. Therefore, a decrease in price alone does not conclusively indicate that 'apply_discount' was invoked.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
