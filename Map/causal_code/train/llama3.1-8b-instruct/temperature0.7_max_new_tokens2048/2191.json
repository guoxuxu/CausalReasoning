  "Problem": "{\n    \"code\": \"class Initializer { int counter; Initializer() { counter = 0; } void increment() { counter += 1; } boolean isEven() { return counter % 2 == 0; } } Initializer init = new Initializer(); init.increment(); boolean result = init.isEven();\"\n  },\n\nIf the `increment()` method is called twice consecutively, will `isEven()` return true?",
  "Explanation": "Each call to `increment()` increases the `counter` by 1. Calling it twice results in `counter` increasing from 0 to 2, which is even. The `isEven()` method checks if `counter % 2 == 0`, and since 2 % 2 is 0, it returns true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
