  "Explanation": "Considering the functions provided, heavy traffic occurs only when the weather condition is rainy. Thus, observing heavy traffic suggests that it was raining, since no other weather condition results in heavy traffic in the given code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
