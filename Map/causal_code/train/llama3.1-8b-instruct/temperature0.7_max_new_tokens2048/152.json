  "Explanation": "Observing an unusual decrease in discounted_prices might suggest that the discount rate was increased as an intervention in the function. Especially if the decrease is greater than predicted by the original discount conditions, this could infer a change in discount_rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
