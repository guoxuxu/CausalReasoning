  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, loyalty_points):\n    if discount > 20:\n        price = price * 0.8  # 20% discount\n    else:\n        price = price * (1 - discount / 100)\n    if loyalty_points > 100:\n        price = price * 0.95  # 5% loyalty bonus\n    return price\",\n\nWould setting `loyalty_points` above 100 always decrease the `price` computed by the function, if `discount` remains constant?",
  "Explanation": "The function includes a specific clause that applies an additional 5% discount when loyalty points exceed 100. This intervention (setting loyalty points above 100) shows a direct causal effect on reducing the price, given a constant discount rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
