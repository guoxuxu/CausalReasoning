  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(sales, costs, economy_factor):\n    sales_increase = sales * (1 + economy_factor / 100)\n    expenses = costs * (1.05)\n    profit = sales_increase - expenses\n    return profit\n\n# Example usage\neconomy_factor = 3\nsales = 150000\ncosts = 50000\nprofit = compute_metrics(sales, costs, economy_factor)\",\n\nIf you forcefully keep economy_factor constant, can changes in sales still affect the profit?",
  "Explanation": "Even if economy_factor is held constant, 'profit' can still be influenced by changes in 'sales'. The 'sales_increase' directly depends on 'sales' alongside the 'economy_factor', so altering 'sales' will change 'sales_increase' and thereby 'profit'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
