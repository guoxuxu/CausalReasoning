  "Explanation": "By setting the temperature above 20 degrees (ensuring comfort) and making it sunny (ensuring a happy mood), both main factors affecting satisfaction are optimized. This setting guarantees that any increase in the number of visitors will proportionally increase visitors_satisfaction since both other factors encourage the highest satisfaction ratio (0.9).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
