  "Explanation": "According to the code, if the car model is 'SUV' and the weather is 'good', the car is directly set to be safe (is_safe = True). This suggests that intervening by changing the model to 'SUV' would indeed result in the car being safe, under the specified condition of good weather.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
