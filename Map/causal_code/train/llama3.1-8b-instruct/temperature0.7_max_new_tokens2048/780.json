  "Explanation": "In the given function, total_sales is computed as the sum of price*volume and the tax_amount. An increase in price leads directly to an increase in both price*volume and tax_amount, thereby causing total_sales to increase. This follows the causal path: price -> price*volume/tax_amount -> total_sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
