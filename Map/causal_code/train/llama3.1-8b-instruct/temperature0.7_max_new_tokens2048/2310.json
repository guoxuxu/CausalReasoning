  "Explanation": "Increasing `red_light_duration` by intervention does not necessarily reflect changes in `green_light_duration` or `yellow_light_duration` because the relationship may depend on other factors or constraints within the intervening function, such as setting `red_light_duration` directly without altering green or yellow durations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
