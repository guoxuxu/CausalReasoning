  "Problem": "Room class with methods to adjust temperature based on heater and window states.\",\n\nCan closing the windows be the reason for a decrease in room temperature if the heater remains off?",
  "Explanation": "Closing the windows only prevents reducing the temperature by blocking the external cold air; it does not cause the temperature to decrease. Actually, it would more likely prevent the temperature from falling due to external colder air if that were occurring.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Closing the windows can cause a decrease in room temperature, and the absence of a heater can also cause a decrease in room temperature, but it is not clear if closing the windows is the reason for a decrease in room temperature when the heater is off because the relation 'Decreased room temperature → Closing windows' implies the opposite causal direction."
