  "Problem": "def calculate_health_effects(smoking, exercise_hours, diet_quality):\n    lung_health = 100 - (20 * smoking) + (10 * exercise_hours)\n    obesity_risk = diet_quality * 30 - exercise_hours * 10\n    cancer_risk = 50 + (25 * smoking) - (5 * diet_quality)\n    return lung_health, obesity_risk, cancer_risk\",\n\nIf we observe decreasing lung health, and we administer a program to stop smoking, can we expect lung health to improve?",
  "Explanation": "The code shows a reduction in lung health by 20 units for each unit increase in smoking. Thus, an intervention to stop smoking should eliminate this negative impact and subsequently improve lung health.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
