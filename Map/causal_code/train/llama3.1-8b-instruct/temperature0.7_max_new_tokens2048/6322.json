  "Explanation": "Starting to take diabetes medication and updating medical history in the app doesn’t allow the inference that their original risk level was necessarily 'medium'. The risk level could have been changed due to other health factors as well or might still remain 'medium' or different if other conditions apply.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
