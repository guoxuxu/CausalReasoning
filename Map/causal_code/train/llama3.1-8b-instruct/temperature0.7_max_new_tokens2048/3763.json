  "Explanation": "The 'update_weather' method sets 'is_raining' to True only if the humidity is above 80, provided the temperature is not below freezing. Thus, observing rain suggests a high likelihood that the humidity exceeded 80, assuming non-freezing temperatures.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
