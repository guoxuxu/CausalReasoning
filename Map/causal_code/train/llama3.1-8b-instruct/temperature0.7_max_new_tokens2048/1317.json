  "Explanation": "The 'treatment_plan' function only includes a 'lifestyle' recommendation of 'DASH' for hypertension, which is diagnosed if blood pressure is above 140. Reducing blood pressure below this threshold through intervention would remove the basis for this recommendation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
