  "Problem": "def calculate_health_effects(smoking, diet_quality, exercise_frequency):\n    lung_cancer_risk = smoking * 0.3\n    heart_disease_risk = (smoking * 0.2) + (diet_quality * -0.1) + (exercise_frequency * -0.1)\n    life_expectancy = 80 - (lung_cancer_risk * 2) - (heart_disease_risk * 3)\n    return lung_cancer_risk, heart_disease_risk, life_expectancy\",\n\nDoes a reduction in life expectancy imply an increase in lung cancer risk?",
  "Explanation": "Life expectancy is negatively affected by an increase in lung cancer risk (lung_cancer_risk is subtracted in the calculation for life expectancy). Hence, a decrease in life expectancy suggests an increase in lung cancer risk.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
