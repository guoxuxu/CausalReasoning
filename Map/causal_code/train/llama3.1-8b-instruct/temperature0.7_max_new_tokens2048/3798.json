  "Explanation": "The original code dictates that a temperature over 30 degrees results in a 'hot' report. Given the initial temperature of 25 degrees and a heat wave increase of 7 degrees, the temperature reaches 32 degrees without rain reduction. Thus, the report will be 'hot'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
