  "Explanation": "If raining is controlled or prevented artificially, the underlying condition that sets is_rainy to True in cooler temperatures (below 20 degrees) becomes irrelevant, allowing outdoor events to be planned despite the lower temperature of 18 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
