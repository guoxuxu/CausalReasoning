  "Explanation": "The discounted_price is directly dependent on the price because discounted_price is calculated as price minus a percentage of the price (initially 10%). If the price increases, discounted_price will accordingly also increase, assuming no other intervention or changes in discount rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
