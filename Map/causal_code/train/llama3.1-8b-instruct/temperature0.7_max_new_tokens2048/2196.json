  "Explanation": "A higher final balance can result from a higher initial account balance, a higher interest rate, or more years allowing for the accumulation of interest. Therefore, a higher final balance does not necessarily mean a higher initial account balance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
