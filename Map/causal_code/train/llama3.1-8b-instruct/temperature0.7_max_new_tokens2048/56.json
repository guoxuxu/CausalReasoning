  "Explanation": "If an intervention ensures that 'willPeopleGoOutside' always returns true, it must be that both conditions (sunny and temperature above 25) are met. Therefore, intervention to achieve this outcome would require ensuring it is sunny along with a higher temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
