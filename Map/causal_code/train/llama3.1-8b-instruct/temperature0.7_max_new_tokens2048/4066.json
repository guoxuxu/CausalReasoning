  "Explanation": "In the provided code, the mood's happiness is explicitly updated to be true if the temperature is above 20 and it is not raining. This directly corresponds to the conditions evaluated in the update_mood method of the Mood class.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
