  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private float temperature; private boolean raining; public void setTemperature(float temp) { temperature = temp; if (temp < 32) { raining = false; } } public boolean isRaining() { return raining; } public void startRain() { if (temperature > 50) { raining = true; } } }\",\n\nIf it started raining immediately after a function call, can it be inferred that the function called was startRain()?",
  "Explanation": "The commencement of rain could be attributed to a call to startRain() or could also be a consequence of other factors or conditions not described, such as another method affecting the rain status indirectly (though not shown in the snippet). Therefore, raining starting does not solely confirm the invocation of startRain().",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
