  "Explanation": "Applying the 'SAVE10' coupon sets the discount to 0.1 (10%). Therefore, regardless of the total price, applying the coupon reduces the total purchase cost by directly decreasing the final amount to be paid.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the 'SAVE10' coupon causes the discount to be 10%, which in turn causes the final price to decrease."
