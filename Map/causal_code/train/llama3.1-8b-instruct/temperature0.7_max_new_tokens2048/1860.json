  "Explanation": "The condition for startRain to set isRaining to true requires the temperature to be below 60 and it not already raining, but does not provide exact information about the temperature, only that it was somewhere below 60. Hence, we cannot determine the exact temperature just based on isRaining turning true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
