  "Explanation": "A heart rate of 80 during activity may simply mean that the steps are fewer than 100. 'stop_activity' sets the heart rate to 60, not 80, and thus it would not be the cause of the heart reaching exactly 80 bpm.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
