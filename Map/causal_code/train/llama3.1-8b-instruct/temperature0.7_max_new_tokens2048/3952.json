  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(values, method='average'): \n    if method == 'average':\n        result = sum(values) / len(values)\n    elif method == 'sum':\n        result = sum(values)\n    else:\n        result = None\n    if result > 50:\n        label = 'high'\n    elif result > 20:\n        label = 'medium'\n    else:\n        label = 'low'\n    return result, label\",\n\nIf we change the method to 'sum', will the label change from 'medium' to 'high' for a fixed list of values?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the method to 'sum' leads to a higher resultant value compared to 'average' when the list contains multiple elements as it aggregates all values rather than dividing by the number of items. If originally the values averaged to a 'medium' result, summing them instead could result in a total exceeding 50, changing the label to 'high'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
