  "Explanation": "Changing the 'customer_type' influences the discount rate in 'compute_discount', which in turn affects 'final_price' outcome by reducing the intermediate 'discounted_price' more. This represents a causal path from cause to effect without intervention as altering the 'customer_type' directly affects the final price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
