  "Explanation": "The heart rate being above 100 is a condition for the risk factor to return 'High'. If an intervention sets the heart rate to below 100, this condition won't be met, and the risk factor will not be 'High' based on the other conditions in the risk_factor method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
