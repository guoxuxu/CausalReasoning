  "Explanation": "The function decide_attire() determines attire based on the planned activity, which in turn depends on the weather (plan_activity()). A change in weather from, for example 'sunny' to 'rainy', will change the activity from 'go to the park' to 'visit a museum', and accordingly the attire from 't-shirt' to 'formal shirt'. Thus, with the occurrence of rain, the attire choice will necessarily change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
