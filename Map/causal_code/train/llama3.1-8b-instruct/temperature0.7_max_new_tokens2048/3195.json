  "Explanation": "Rain is only caused by the temperature being below 20. As the temperature decreases only when the hour updates past 12 (i.e., temperature -= 5), which then can lead to temperatures that potentially cause rain, noticing it's rainy indirectly implies that the hour was set past 12.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
