  "Explanation": "The method 'is_flu' determines flu status based on fever and cough intensity. Since the post-treatment status is checked after administering an antipyretic (which sets has_fever to False), and given that having a fever is a necessary condition to classify as flu, the removal of the fever would lead to a change in flu status from True to False.",
