  "Explanation": "Based on the 'willItRainTomorrow' method, for it to rain tomorrow, it is a necessary condition that today's temperature is above 3 degrees Celsius and it is currently not raining. So, if it is forecasted to rain, the temperature must indeed have been above this threshold.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
