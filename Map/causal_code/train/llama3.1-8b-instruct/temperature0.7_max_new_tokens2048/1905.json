  "Explanation": "An increase in the number of customers does not necessarily lead to an increase in sales because the customers may not purchase any items. The causal relationship from the number of customers to sales depends on other factors such as the customers' intent to buy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
