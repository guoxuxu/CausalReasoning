  "Explanation": "Manipulating the ad spend directly affects the number of ads, which in turn affects sales. Hence, even with a constant budget, reallocating funds to increase ad spend will directly increase sales.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
