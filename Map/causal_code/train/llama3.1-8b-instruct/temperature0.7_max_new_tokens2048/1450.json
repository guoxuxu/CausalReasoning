  "Explanation": "If the account balance post-intervention is 300, and knowing the operations allowed (deposit and withdraw), it can be deduced that an intervention set the balance to a specific amount and a subsequent withdrawal was made that reduced it to 300, equal to the earlier balance minus the withdrawal amount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
