  "Explanation": "If the final_price is less after changes to the discount logic, it suggests that other alterations like tax_rate adjustments or the updated logic in apply_discount are more directly responsible. Simply changing the base_price with unchanged tax rate or discount logic would not solely account for a reduced final_price; the effect implies broader modifications.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
