  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 26 directly engages the conditional within adjust_temperature that adds 10 to humidity if the temperature exceeds 25. Therefore, humidity is guaranteed to increase as a result of this intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
