  "Explanation": "Intervening by applying the correct treatment ('cold') for Bob's disease will cure him according to the logic in the 'treat' method, demonstrating an intervention that modifies the cause (treatment) to achieve the desired effect (cure).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
