  "Explanation": "Profit is directly influenced by both total_sales and expenses, as expressed by the equation profit = total_sales * 0.2 - expenses. If expenses are modified through an intervention while keeping total_sales the same, the profit would change accordingly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
