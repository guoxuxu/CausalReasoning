  "Explanation": "A maximum observed growth rate of 3 implies optimal conditions met for water, sunlight, and temperature. Given the temperature threshold for optimal growth is narrow (20-25 degrees Celsius), observing this rate indicates the temperature would have been adjusted to fall within this range.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
