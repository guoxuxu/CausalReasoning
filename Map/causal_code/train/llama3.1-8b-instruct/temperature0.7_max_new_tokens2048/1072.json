  "Explanation": "There could be cases where an employee with sales figures less than 100000 wasn't promoted despite their previous performance being 'excellent' if their sales figures were also less than 50000, as both conditions (previous performance being 'excellent' and sales figures more than 50000) are necessary for promotion under those circumstances.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
