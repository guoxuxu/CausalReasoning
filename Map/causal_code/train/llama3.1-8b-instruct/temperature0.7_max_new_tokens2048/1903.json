  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data and data['age'] > 30:\n        data['category'] = 'Adult'\n    else:\n        data['category'] = 'Young'\n    if data.get('income', 0) > 50000:\n        data['status'] = 'High-Income'\n    else:\n        data['status'] = 'Low-Income'\n    return data\",\n\nIf we modify the data to set an age of 35, will the person be categorized as 'Adult'?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the data to set an age of 35 directly feeds into the condition checked in the 'if' statement regarding age. Once this condition is true (age > 30), the program logically assigns the category as 'Adult', indepedent of other data fields.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
