  "Explanation": "A significant decrease in heart rate could be indicative of the application of 'cardio' medicine particularly because the effect size (-15) is different from the smaller modifications due to step count changes. However, without additional context that rules out changes in steps, this cannot be determined definitively.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
