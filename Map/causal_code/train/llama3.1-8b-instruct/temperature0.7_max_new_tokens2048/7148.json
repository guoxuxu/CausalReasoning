  "Explanation": "Given that risk is set manually to 'high', the only pathway in the code for setting 'risk' to 'high' is if 'temp_status' is 'high' and 'humidity' is greater than 50. Despite 'temp_status' potentially not aligning with actual temperature data due to intervention, 'humidity' must still be over 50 for the code to initially set 'risk' to 'high', meaning the humidity condition must be met even upon intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
