  "Explanation": "When manually setting a higher temperature and then calling `simulate_day`, since `increase_temp` further increases the temperature potentially above 30, the associated humidity reduction condition (`self.humidity -= 10` if `self.temperature > 30`) within the `increase_temp` gets triggered. Therefore, this intervention causes a cascading effect that results in lower humidity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
