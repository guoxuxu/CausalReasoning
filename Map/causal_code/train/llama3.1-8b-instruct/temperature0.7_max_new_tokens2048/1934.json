  "Explanation": "An increase in heart rate could also be caused by other factors in the code such as drinking coffee, which independently raises the heart rate by 5, or it might not reflect any change due to activity level if the person is at 'low' activity or takes 'beta_blocker' medicine.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
