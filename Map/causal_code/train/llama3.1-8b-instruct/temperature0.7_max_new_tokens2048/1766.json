  "Explanation": "Although the number of cars exceeds 100, the condition also requires it to be during peak hours for a traffic jam to occur. With the given scenario during non-peak hours, the traffic jam condition will not be met.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
