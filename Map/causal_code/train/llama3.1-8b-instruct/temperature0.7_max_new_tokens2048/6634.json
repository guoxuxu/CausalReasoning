  "Explanation": "The adjustment made in the feels_like method reduces by 0.5 if the humidity is 70 or below, leading to a lower feels_like temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
