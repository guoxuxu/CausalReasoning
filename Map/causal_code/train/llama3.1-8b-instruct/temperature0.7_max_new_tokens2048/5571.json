  "Explanation": "Buying items worth $150 triggers the 'buy' method, where the amount is over $100. This results in an addition of 10 points to the 'points'. Since there's no accumulation mechanism and points start at 0, a single purchase gives 10 points, which is insufficient for redemption (requires 50 points). However, without the context of initial 'points' or repeated actions, we assumed multiple transactions bringing the points to at least 50.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
