  "Explanation": "Speed can only increase if the engine is on. Under normal circumstances with the given class methods and assuming no external tampering, the start_engine method is a prerequisite for is_engine_on being True.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
