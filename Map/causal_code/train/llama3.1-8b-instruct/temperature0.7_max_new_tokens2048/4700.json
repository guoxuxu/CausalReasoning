  "Explanation": "For the weather condition to be 'Dry', the code requires humidity to be under 20 and temperature to be above 30. Therefore, if the weather condition is 'Dry', the temperature must have been above 30.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
