  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    data['adjusted'] = data['original'] * 1.2 \n    if data['environment'] == 'urban': \n        data['final'] = data['adjusted'] + 20 \n    else: \n        data['final'] = data['adjusted'] - 10 \n    return data\",\n\nIf we manually set the 'original' value higher and change the environment to urban, will the 'final' value be higher compared to a non-urban environment with the same 'original' value?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by setting a higher 'original' value increases the 'adjusted' value. Changing the environment to urban adds a further 20 to the already increased 'adjusted' value, resulting in a higher 'final' value compared to a non-urban environment, where the increase in 'adjusted' value is offset by subtracting 10.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
