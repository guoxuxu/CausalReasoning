  "Explanation": "Fuel level decreases only when the 'drive' method is called, which deducts 10 from 'fuelLevel' every time it's executed. This is an example of testing the effect of the 'drive' method on 'fuelLevel' with an intervention (calling 'drive') decreasing fuel.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
