  "Explanation": "While it's true that increasing the initial balance leads to an increase in final interest, we cannot reverse this relationship definitively without considering other factors. The increase in final_interest could also be due to an increase in the interest rate or the number of years, hence we cannot confirm the change in initial_balance solely based on final_interest without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
