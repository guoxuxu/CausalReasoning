Higher economic indicators suggest market stability, impacting growth depending on the temperature.\"\n  },\n\nIf the economic indicator is 80, is it possible to observe High Growth without modifying any variable?",
  "Explanation": "With an economic indicator of 80, the market becomes stable (market_stability = True). If the temperature is also above 20, the function will naturally return 'High Growth'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
