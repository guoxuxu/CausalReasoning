  "Explanation": "An increase in total_spent could be due to various factors such as an increase in product prices or a change in user preferences leading to the purchase of pricier products within the original threshold. These factors can contribute to higher spending without any alteration to the preference_threshold.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
