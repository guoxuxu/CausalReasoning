  "Explanation": "If there is a change in the output of water_plants from 'Watering plants' to 'No need to water plants', it implies that is_raining has changed to True. This indicates a change in weather conditions based on the rules defined in update_weather, which functions depending on the values of temperature and humidity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
