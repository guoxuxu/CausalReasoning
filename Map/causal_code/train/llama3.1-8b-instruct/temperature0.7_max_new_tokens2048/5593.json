  "Explanation": "This intervention involves directly manipulating a causal factor (temperature) to observe its effect on rainy weather. When temperature decreases (specifically if previously it was above 25 thereby causing rain), calling setRainy method associated with lowering the temperature will switch the weather to not rainy (if the condition meets), effectively reducing the chances of rain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
