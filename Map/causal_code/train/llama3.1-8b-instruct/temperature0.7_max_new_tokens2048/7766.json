  "Explanation": "For satisfaction to be 'high', the score must be over 80, which is indeed over 50. The 'and happy' part is contributed by the bonus being over 50, but this does not affect the causality derived from a 'high' satisfaction which necessitates the score being above 50.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
