  "Explanation": "Setting 'processed' to False via an intervention does not automatically imply 'error' was present. This is because the intervention could alter 'processed' irrespective of 'data's initial content (via changing 'status' or directly altering 'processed'). Therefore, we cannot conclusively backtrack to the presence of 'error' based on an intervened output to cause reasoning.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
