  "Explanation": "The design of the code specifies that 'condition' changes are effects of the 'medication_taken' value, not causes of it. There's no mechanism in the code where setting the condition influences whether medication was taken, illustrating that effect-to-cause inference without intervention here isn't valid.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
