  "Problem": "def update_inventory(stock, item, quantity, sold):\n    if item in stock:\n        if sold:\n            stock[item] -= quantity\n            return 'Item sold'\n        else:\n            stock[item] += quantity\n            return 'Stock updated'\n    else:\n        if not sold:\n            stock[item] = quantity\n            return 'New item added'\n        else:\n            return 'Item not in stock'\",\n\nIf the variable 'sold' is set to True without any other changes, will this reduce the quantity of 'item' in 'stock'?",
  "Explanation": "The code checks if 'sold' is True and the item exists in the stock, then it decrements the stock of that item by the specified 'quantity'. This directly leads from the cause (item is sold) to reducing the stock amount, without external intervention modifying other variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
