  "Explanation": "With a positive number of doctors, increasing the number of patients up to a limit set by five times the number of doctors directly increases the number of patients treated. However, this effect tops out once it reaches the maximum capacity of doctors to treat (doctors * 5).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
