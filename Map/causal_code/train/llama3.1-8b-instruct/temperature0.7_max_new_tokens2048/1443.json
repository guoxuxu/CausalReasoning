  "Explanation": "The base price is originally set to 100, and it is modified by a random increase of between 5 and 20 before the discount is applied. Therefore, the discounted price would not specifically be 85 since it depends on how much the base price was increased. The final discounted price would be \\( (100 + \\text{{random increase}}) \\times (0.85) \\), which varies depending on the random increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
