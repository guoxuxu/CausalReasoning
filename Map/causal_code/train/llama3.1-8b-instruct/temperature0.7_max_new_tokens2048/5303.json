  "Explanation": "Changing the status from 'regular' to 'VIP' increases the base discount from 0.05 to 0.2. This larger discount leads to a decrease in the final price paid by the customer, thus the discounted prices decrease.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Customer status affects the base discount, which in turn affects the total discount, ultimately influencing the discounted prices."
