  "Problem": "def weather_effect(day):\n  if day == 'sunny':\n    mood = 'happy'\n    productivity = 'high'\n  elif day == 'rainy':\n    mood = 'sad'\n    productivity = 'low'\n  else:\n    mood = 'neutral'\n    productivity = 'medium'\n  return mood, productivity\n\nweather = 'sunny'\nmood, productivity = weather_effect(weather)\",\n\nIf productivity is observed as low, can we infer that the day was rainy?",
  "Explanation": "Based on the function 'weather_effect', productivity being low is directly associated with the day being 'rainy'. While this does not exclude other unmodeled factors potentially affecting productivity, within the constraints of this code, low productivity implies rainy weather.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
