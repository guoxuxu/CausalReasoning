  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    updated_data = data * 2\n    return updated_data\n\ndata = 5\nresult = process_data(data)\nif result > 10:\n    output = 'High'\nelse:\n    output = 'Low'\",\n\nIf the final 'output' is 'High', can we conclude that the initial 'data' was greater than 5?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'result' is determined by doubling the 'data' and the output 'High' occurs only if 'result' is more than 10, this can only be true if the initial 'data' was greater than 5. Hence, a high output implies the data exceeded 5 initially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
