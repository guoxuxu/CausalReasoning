  "Explanation": "Although the decreaseTemperature method sets acState to true, having both acState and heaterState true simultaneously cannot result solely from calling decreaseTemperature, because it checks for heaterState being off before changing acState. Thus, you cannot conclusively determine that decreaseTemperature() was called based solely on these conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
