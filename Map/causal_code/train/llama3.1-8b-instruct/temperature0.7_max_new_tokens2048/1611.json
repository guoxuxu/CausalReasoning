  "Problem": "def manage_inventory(item, sales): \n    if item.stock < 10: \n        item.reorder(30) \n    item.stock -= sales \n    if sales > 20: \n        item.create_discount(5) \n    return item.stock\",\n\nIf an item's initial stock is below 10, will its stock level increase within the manage_inventory function?",
  "Explanation": "The code shows that when the stock level is below 10, the manage_inventory function triggers a restock (reorder) of 30 units. Hence, the stock level increases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
