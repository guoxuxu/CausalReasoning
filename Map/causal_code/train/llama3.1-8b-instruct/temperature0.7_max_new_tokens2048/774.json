  "Explanation": "Manually setting 'cloud_coverage' to 70% would set 'is_raining' to True according to the logic in the 'update_weather' method. This manually setting an attribute simulates an intervention, which then tests the causal effect of increasing cloud coverage on rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
