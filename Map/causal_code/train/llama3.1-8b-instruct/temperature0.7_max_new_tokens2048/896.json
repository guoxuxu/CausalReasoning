  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(prices, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        discount_rate = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount_rate = 0.05\n    discounted_prices = [price * (1 - discount_rate) for price in prices]\n    return discounted_prices\",\n\nIf the 'season' is set to 'winter', will the discount rate be less than when the season is 'summer'?",
  "Explanation": "The code sets a higher discount rate for the summer (10%) compared to other seasons (5%). Therefore, the discount rate in winter (5%) is indeed lower than in summer (10%).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
