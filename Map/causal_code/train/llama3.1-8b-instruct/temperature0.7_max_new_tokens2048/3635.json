  "Problem": "Python code defined above\",\n\nIf a person recovered quickly, does it imply they were young?",
  "Explanation": "Quick recovery is more directly related to immune system strength and not being vulnerable due to age. Though being young could be a factor, it is possible for old individuals with strong immune systems to also recover quickly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
