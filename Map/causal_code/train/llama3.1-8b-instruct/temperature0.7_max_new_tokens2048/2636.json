  "Explanation": "Setting the season to holiday and increasing the budget to 6000 ensures the marketing strategy is set to 'intensive_campaign'. According to the code, an intensive campaign results in improved sales numbers across all economic conditions. Therefore, intervention increases sales irrespective of economic condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
