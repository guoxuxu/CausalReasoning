  "Explanation": "A high chance of rain (e.g., 0.9) strongly suggests the weather might be 'rainy'. However, the response 'cloudy' also results in a non-zero chance of rain (0.5), so a high value does not exclusively confirm the weather as 'rainy'. This is a cause-effect relationship where the effect alone (high chance of rain) cannot definitively determine the specific cause (weather being 'rainy', 'cloudy', or 'sunny') without further information.",
