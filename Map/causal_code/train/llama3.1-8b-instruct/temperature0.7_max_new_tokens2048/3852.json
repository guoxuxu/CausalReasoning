  "Explanation": "Manually setting the temperature to 35 and calling update_weather_status will result in the weather status being 'Hot' due to the temperature check (>30). Given that the humidity in the app instance is initialized at 80 (which is >70), the weather status will further include ' and Humid'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
