  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    warmed_data = 0.5 * data * (1.2 + data)\n    if data > 20:\n        return warmed_data \n    else:\n        return warmed_data - 10\n\ndata_input = 15\nresult = process_data(data_input)\",\n\nIf we remove the conditional subtraction of 10 from the 'process_data' function, and increase 'data_input', will 'result' increase?",
  "Explanation": "By removing the conditional subtraction from the functionality, the output 'result' becomes solely dependent on the scaled 'warmed_data' value. Since this value is calculated as 0.5 * data * (1.2 + data), which is a monotonically increasing function (all coefficients are positive and increasing with data), increasing 'data_input' directly leads to an increase in 'result'. Thus, making this intervention simplifies the relation and ensures an increase in output with an increase in input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
