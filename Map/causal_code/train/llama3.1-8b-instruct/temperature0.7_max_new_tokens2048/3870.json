  "Explanation": "The method 'update_temperature' checks if the temperature is greater than or equal to 100.4 and turns the alarm on if true through the 'set_alarm' method. Hence, setting the temperature to 101 triggers the alarm.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
