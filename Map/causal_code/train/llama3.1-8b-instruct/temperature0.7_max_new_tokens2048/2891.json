  "Explanation": "A decrease in VAT could result from either a decrease in the VAT rate or a decrease in the product's price due to applying a higher discount. Without specific information about the VAT rate or other changes to the price, we can't definitively conclude that the discount was increased solely based on the observed decrease in VAT.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
