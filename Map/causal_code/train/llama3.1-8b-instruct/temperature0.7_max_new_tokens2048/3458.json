  "Explanation": "The `feels_like` method in the code increases the feels-like temperature by adjusting it up by 5 degrees if the humidity is greater than 70%. Therefore, a higher humidity leads directly to a higher feels-like temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
