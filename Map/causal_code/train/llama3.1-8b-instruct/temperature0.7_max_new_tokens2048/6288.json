  "Explanation": "Higher initial_final_prices could result from either higher original prices or lower discounts. Since both original prices and discount rates influence the final prices, you cannot definitively infer the original prices based merely on higher initial final prices without considering the discount rates.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
