  "Explanation": "A high mean in the returned statistics from compute_statistics does not necessarily imply that the data had outliers, because outliers are removed if the 'clean' flag is used prior to analysis. The high mean could result either from high-density data within the accepted range or usage of the 'analyze' flag without prior cleaning.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
