  "Problem": "{\n        \"Description\": \"A software module for a content management system where posts by users are automatically categorized based on keywords and tagged by sentiment before being published. The sentiment tagging can occasionally fail due to API timeouts.\",\n        \"Code\": \"def categorize_post(post):\n    keywords = extract_keywords(post.content)\n    category = determine_category(keywords)\n    return category\n\ndef tag_sentiment(post):\n    try:\n        sentiment = sentiment_analysis_api(post.content)\n    except TimeoutError:\n        sentiment = 'Unknown'\n    post.sentiment = sentiment\n    return sentiment\n\ndef publish_post(post):\n    category = categorize_post(post)\n    sentiment = tag_sentiment(post)\n    database.save(post.category, post.sentiment, post.content)\n    return 'Post Published'\"\n    },\n\nIf the sentiment analysis API improves its response time, will this reduce the occurrences of 'Unknown' sentiment tags in published posts?",
  "Explanation": "Improving the API's response time decreases the likelihood of timeouts, directly reducing the instances where the fallback sentiment 'Unknown' is used because the exception block in the 'tag_sentiment' function would be triggered less frequently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
