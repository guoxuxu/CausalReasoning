  "Explanation": "A decrease in blood pressure cannot conclusively indicate that medication was applied because the stress level (which influences blood pressure) might have decreased as well, or other factors not included in the code could also be at play. Specifically, the scenario doesn't exclude the possibility blood pressure might decrease naturally or through other interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
