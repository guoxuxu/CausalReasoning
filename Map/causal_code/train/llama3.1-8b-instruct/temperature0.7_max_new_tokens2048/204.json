  "Explanation": "An increase in 'Total Costs' would logically decrease 'Net Profit', regardless of whether a discount was applied or not. An increase in net profit from increasing costs cannot logically support the conclusion about the status of 'discount_applied'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
