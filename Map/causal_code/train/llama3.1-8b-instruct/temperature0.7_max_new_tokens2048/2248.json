  "Explanation": "A value less than 100 could be because the Heal method was never called, or it might also be due to the TakeDamage method reducing health to below 100 subsequently even after healing. Without additional information (such as initial health or subsequent method calls), we cannot conclusively infer the non-calling of the Heal method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
