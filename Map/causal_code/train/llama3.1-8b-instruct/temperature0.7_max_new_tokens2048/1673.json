  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    data = sorted(data)\n    result = []\n    for d in data:\n        if d % 2 == 0:\n            result.append(d + 1)\n        else:\n            result.append(d - 1)\n    return result\n\ndata_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3]\nfinal_result = process_data(data_list)\",\n\nIf you manipulate 'process_data()' by adding 2 instead of 1 to even numbers, will this ensure 'final_result' contains greater numbers compared to original implementation for even input numbers?",
  "Explanation": "In this intervened scenario, every even number from 'data_list' adds 2 instead of 1, leading to output numbers that are exactly one unit higher for each even number compare to the original implementation. Thus, the results for even numbers are guaranteed to be greater.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
