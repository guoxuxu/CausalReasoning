  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'discount_rate' from 0.1 to 0.2 effectively doubles the discount applied to prices over 50. This intervention reduces each affected price more than when the discount rate was 0.1, resulting in even lower prices in 'discounted_prices'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
