  "Explanation": "A significantly lower final price can be due to a higher discount, which may suggest it is either winter or that there was an intervention (e.g., a special promotion), or due to a lower initial product price itself. Thus, observing a lower price does not necessarily pinpoint the season as winter without more information about potential discounts or the original price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
