It includes an override feature for the maximum number of cups allowed.\",\n    \"code\": \"\"\"\n    class CoffeeMachine:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.cups_made = 0\n            self.power_usage = 0\n            self.temperature = 20  # ambient temperature in Celsius\n\n        def make_coffee(self, cups):\n            if self.temperature < 15:\n                self.power_usage += 1.5 * cups\n            else:\n                self.power_usage += cups\n            self.cups_made += cups\n\n        def set_temperature(self, temp):\n            self.temperature = temp\n\n        def override_max_cups(self, max_cups):\n            self.cups_made = min(self.cups_made, max_cups)\n\n    # Example usage:\n    machine = CoffeeMachine()\n    machine.set_temperature(10)\n    machine.make_coffee(5)\n    machine.override_max_cups(3)\n    \"\"\"\n  },\n\nIf the ambient temperature increases, does the coffee machine's power usage for making the same number of cups decrease?",
  "Explanation": "The code shows that if the temperature is below 15 degrees Celsius, the power usage per cup increases by 1.5 times. Thus, if the temperature increases past this threshold, less power will be used per cup, leading to a decrease in total power consumption for the same number of cups made.",
