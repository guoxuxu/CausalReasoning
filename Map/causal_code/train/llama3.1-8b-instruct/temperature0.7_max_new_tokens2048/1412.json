  "Explanation": "Although setting the temperature below 5 will trigger rain, rain can also be started manually via the 'manualRainStart' method irrespective of temperature, hence, rain being true doesn't necessarily mean the temperature was below 5.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
