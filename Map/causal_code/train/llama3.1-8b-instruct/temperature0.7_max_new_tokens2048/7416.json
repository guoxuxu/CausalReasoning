  "Explanation": "A uniform decrease across all final prices despite consistent region-based taxation is indicative of an intervention like applying a higher discount rate universally. This scenario aligns with the influence expected from uniformly higher discounts, leading to universally lower final prices before tax is even applied, supporting the causality from applied intervention discount to decreased prices.",
