  "Explanation": "Stopping of rain indicates that the temperature is above 20 degrees. However, this could be due to the natural progression of weather within the given season (like a transition from Spring to Summer) or other natural variations in temperature, not necessarily from human intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
