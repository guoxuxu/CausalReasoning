  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, coupon_code):\n    if coupon_code == 'SUMMER20':\n        discount = 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == 'WINTER10':\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0\n    final_price = price - (price * discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf 'final_price' is less than 'price', can it be concluded that the 'coupon_code' was 'SUMMER20'?",
  "Explanation": "While 'SUMMER20' does reduce the 'final_price', 'WINTER10', which provides a 10% discount, can also reduce 'final_price'. A reduction in 'final_price' therefore cannot uniquely determine that 'SUMMER20' was used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
