  "Explanation": "Adjusting 'economic_index' impacts 'future_sales' through the 'economic_effect'. However, 'historical_sales' is a distinct input parameter and retains its original values regardless of changes in 'economic_index' or 'future_sales'. Therefore, changes in 'future_sales' do not imply changes in 'historical_sales'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
