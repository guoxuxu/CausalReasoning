  "Explanation": "The 'apply_discount' method updates the amounts in completed sales records by reducing them, based on the discount percentage. Since the average sale amount is calculated from these amounts, applying a discount results in a lower average sale amount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
