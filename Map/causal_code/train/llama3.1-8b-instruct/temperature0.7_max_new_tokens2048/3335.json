  "Explanation": "While stopping the car sets the speed to zero and turns off the engine, merely observing a speed of zero does not guarantee that the engine status is 'off'. The car could be idling with the engine on, but not moving.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
