  "Problem": "class RoomController {\n  int temperature = 20;\n  boolean heaterOn = false;\n\n  public void increaseTemp() {\n    heaterOn = true;\n    temperature += 5;\n  }\n\n  public void decreaseTemp() {\n    if (heaterOn) {\n      heaterOn = false;\n    }\n    temperature -= 3;\n  }\n\n  public String checkStatus() {\n    if (heaterOn) {\n      return \"Heater is on and temperature is \" + temperature;\n    } else {\n      return \"Heater is off and temperature is \" + temperature;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the temperature is 17, does it necessarily mean the decreaseTemp() method was just called?",
  "Explanation": "Since the initial temperature is set at 20 and the only way to decrease the temperature is through the decreaseTemp() method which reduces it by 3, a temperature of 17 indicates that decreaseTemp() was recently called. This examines the scenario from effect to cause without intervention.",
