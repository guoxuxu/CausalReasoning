  "Explanation": "Increasing the length of the data might lead to a higher adjusted_mean if and only if the length crosses the threshold (50 in this case), triggering the conditional increment. However, it also depends on the sum of the data; if the average (mean_val) decreases significantly despite the increased length, the overall effect might not lead to an increase in adjusted_mean.",
