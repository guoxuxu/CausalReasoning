Higher economic indicators suggest market stability, impacting growth depending on the temperature.\"\n  },\n\nAfter observing Moderate Growth, if we intervene to raise the temperature above 20, can it change the growth to High Growth?",
  "Explanation": "Moderate Growth occurs when there's instability in the market (economic indicator <= 75) but the temperature is above 20. Raising the temperature alone won't suffice as the market still lacks stability. Therefore, Moderate Growth will likely remain, unless market stability is also addressed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
