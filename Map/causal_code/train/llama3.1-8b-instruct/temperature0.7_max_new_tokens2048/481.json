  "Explanation": "The function `analyze_traffic_data` specifies that if the weather is rainy, the traffic will be 'heavy', regardless of whether it’s a holiday or not. Thus, changing the weather from sunny to rainy directly leads to heavier traffic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
