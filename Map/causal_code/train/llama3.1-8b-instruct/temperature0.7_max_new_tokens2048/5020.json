  "Explanation": "A decrease in `final_sales` could result from multiple factors such as lower `total_sales` or a change in `discount` rates due to average price fluctuations. An increase in `average_price` alone does not directly imply a decrease in `final_sales` as it could either raise or lower the discount impacting `final_sales` in a complex manner.",
