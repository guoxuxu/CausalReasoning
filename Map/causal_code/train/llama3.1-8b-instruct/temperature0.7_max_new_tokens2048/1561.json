  "Explanation": "Increasing the customer's budget will enhance their purchasing power. Since the product's discounted price post-sale is 90 units, increasing the budget to 110 units (from 90) would allow the customer to afford the product.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
