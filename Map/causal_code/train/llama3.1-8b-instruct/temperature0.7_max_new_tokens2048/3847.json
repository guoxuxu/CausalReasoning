  "Problem": "def compute_stats(data): \n    mean = sum(data) / len(data) \n    adjusted_data = [x * 0.9 for x in data] \n    adjusted_mean = sum(adjusted_data) / len(adjusted_data) \n    return mean, adjusted_mean\",\n\nIf the 'mean' is observed to be unusually high, can we assume that the values in 'data' were high?",
  "Explanation": "Given no other anomalies like outliers or errors in data input, a high 'mean' value would generally suggest that the individual values in 'data' were also high, as 'mean' directly depends on the values of 'data'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
