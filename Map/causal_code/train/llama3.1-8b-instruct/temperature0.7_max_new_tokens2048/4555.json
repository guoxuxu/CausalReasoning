  "Explanation": "The 'calculate_immune_response' method evaluates the individual's age to set the immune response. For ages under 30, the method is programmed to return 'high', signifying a high immune response, independent of any treatments or medications added.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
