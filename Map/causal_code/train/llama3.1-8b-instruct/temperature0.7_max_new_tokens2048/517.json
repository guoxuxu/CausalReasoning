  "Problem": "def temperature_adjustment(sensor_data): \n  temp = sensor_data['temperature'] \n  humidity = sensor_data['humidity'] \n  if humidity > 50: \n    adjustment = 0.1 * (humidity - 50) \n  else:  \n    adjustment = 0 \n  adjusted_temp = temp - adjustment \n  return adjusted_temp \n \n sensor_data = {'temperature': 80, 'humidity': 60} \n print(temperature_adjustment(sensor_data))\",\n\nIf the humidity increases without other interventions, will the adjusted temperature decrease?",
  "Explanation": "The code decreases the base temperature by a factor proportional to the humidity above 50. Increasing humidity leads to a higher adjustment, thus a lower adjusted temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
