Is this true?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the hypothetical 'remove_item' method also subtracts the item's price from 'total_cost', then using it after items have been added would decrease the 'total_cost'. This involves an intervention (using 'remove_item') that changes the effect (reducing 'total_cost').",
