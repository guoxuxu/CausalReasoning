  "Problem": "def calculate_bonus(salary, performance_rating):\n    if performance_rating > 8:\n        bonus = salary * 0.2\n    elif performance_rating > 5:\n        bonus = salary * 0.1\n    else:\n        bonus = 0\n    return bonus\",\n\nIf the bonus amount observed increases significantly, can we infer that the function to calculate bonus was modified to a higher fixed percentage above a certain performance rating?",
  "Explanation": "A significant increase in bonus not attributed by the corresponding thresholds of the original logic (5 and 8) implies that there may have been an intervention, such as modifying the bonus calculation to a higher fixed percentage. This suggests the function was altered to provide greater incentives.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in performance rating directly influences the bonus amount, and a higher salary also directly influences the bonus amount."
