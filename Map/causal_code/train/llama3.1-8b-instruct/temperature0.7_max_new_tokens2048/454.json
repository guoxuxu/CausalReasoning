  "Problem": "WeatherSystem Python Class\",\n\nIf observed temperature decreases, did the season change to winter?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in temperature may not necessarily indicate a change to winter, as the decrease could also be caused by an increase in wind speed due to the apply_wind_effect method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
