  "Explanation": "If the decision to travel is negative (False), the only condition under which this decision is reached is 'heavy' traffic. Although you can't directly observe traffic in this scenario, you can logically deduce that the traffic must have been heavy since it’s the only situation leading to a negative travel decision.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
