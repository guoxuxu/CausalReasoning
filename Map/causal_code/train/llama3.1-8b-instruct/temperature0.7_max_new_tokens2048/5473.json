  "Problem": "class SaleAnalysis { constructor(data) { this.data = data; } averageSale() { let total = this.data.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.amount, 0); return this.data.length > 0 ? total / this.data.length : 0; } discountImpact(discountRate) { let newData = this.data.map(item => ({ amount: item.amount * (1 - discountRate), date: item.date })); let newAvg = new SaleAnalysis(newData).averageSale(); let oldAvg = this.averageSale(); return (newAvg - oldAvg) / oldAvg; } }\",\n\nIf a discount rate is applied, will the 'discountImpact' method show a negative impact on average sales?",
  "Explanation": "The 'discountImpact' method calculates the impact of applying a discount on the average sales. Since the discount lowers the sale amounts, it typically reduces the average sale amount, resulting in a negative impact as described by the method.",
