  "Explanation": "A non-zero total_savings suggests that a discount was applied, but this can occur with any order_status provided that the appropriate conditions in 'promo_applied' and 'user_category' are fulfilled. Therefore, we cannot infer the order_status directly from the savings amount without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
