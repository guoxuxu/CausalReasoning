  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, volume, discount, holiday):\n                      base_price = price * (1 - discount)\n                      if holiday:\n                          extra_fee = 10\n                          sales = (base_price + extra_fee) * volume\n                      else:\n                          sales = base_price * volume\n                      return sales\",\n\nWithout changing any inputs, if 'sales' decreases significantly, can this imply that a 'holiday' recently ended?",
  "Explanation": "The code applies an additional 'extra_fee' of 10 to the 'base_price' on holidays. If 'sales' decreases significantly without any changes in other variables such as 'price', 'volume', or 'discount', this could imply that a 'holiday' ended, removing the 'extra_fee' and thus reducing the 'sales'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
