  "Explanation": "The absence of 'Value is below threshold.' being printed indicates that 'result' consistently outputs 'High', suggesting higher values for 'adjusted_data'. However, this observation cannot conclusively prove that the multiplier factor was altered, as the initial value of 'data_input' could also be naturally higher.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
