  "Explanation": "A decrease in total sales suggests either refunds were issued, reducing the amounts in existing records, or the status of some records changed away from 'completed', which means their amounts are no longer included in the 'total_sales' calculation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
