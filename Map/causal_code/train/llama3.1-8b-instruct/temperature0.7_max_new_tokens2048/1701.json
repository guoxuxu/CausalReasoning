  "Explanation": "By reducing the number of questions to fewer than 5, students are not subjected to the incremental increase in stress specified in the quiz_given function. As a result, stress levels are likely to be lower unless externally influenced by other factors, thus reducing instances where teachers would observe students needing support due to high stress.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
