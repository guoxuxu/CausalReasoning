  "Explanation": "The condition for predicting 'Rain' requires both temperature being over 30 and humidity being over 70. If the weather is 'Rain', it confirms that both these conditions are met.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
