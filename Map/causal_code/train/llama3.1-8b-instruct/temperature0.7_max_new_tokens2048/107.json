  "Explanation": "Switching the treatment plan to 'advanced' increases patient health by 40. Given that they start from 20 (after initial 'regular' treatment and impacts of 4 doctors), and 40 increase would result in patient health reaching at least 60. With 'advanced' treatment and considering subsequent doctor effects and maximum health cap at 100, the health could reach up to 100.",
