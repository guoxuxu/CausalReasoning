  "Problem": "class Experiment { int temp; double reactionRate; void increaseTemp() { temp += 5; if (temp > 100) reactionRate *= 2; else reactionRate += 10; } void decreaseReaction() { if (reactionRate > 20) { reactionRate -= 5; temp -= 3; } } }\",\n\nIf it is observed that the reaction rate reduces, does it imply the temperature was directly decreased?",
  "Explanation": "The 'decreaseReaction()' method reduces the reaction rate when the reaction rate is above 20, and this method concurrently decreases the temperature by 3. However, the decrease in reaction rate doesn't necessarily imply a direct intervention on temperature, as the temperature reduction is a secondary effect caused by decreasing the reaction rate in the 'decreaseReaction()' method without direct intervention to temperature itself.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
