  "Explanation": "If the player’s health is 95 after playing more hours, and knowing that each hour reduces health by 1 point for players 18 or older, the first condition for health to be 95 originally (at 100 health) implies only 5 hours played. Under the code given, a health of 95 for a player aged 18 or older is not possible unless the intervention sets fewer hours, hence under normal circumstances the player must be younger than 18, where health decreases 2 points per hour.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
