  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  threshold = 5\n  count = 0\n  for item in data:\n    if item > threshold:\n      count += 1\n      item_modified = item * 2\n    else:\n      item_modified = item + 2\n    print('Processed:', item_modified)\n  return count\n\nresult = process_data([1, 6, 3, 8])\",\n\nWould increasing every 'item' in the 'data' list by 2 increase the 'count' of items above the threshold when the code is rerun?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing each item's value makes it more likely that more items will exceed the threshold value, thus increasing the 'count'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
