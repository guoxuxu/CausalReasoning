  "Problem": "def process_data(data, condition): \n    if condition == 'A': \n        result = sum(data) + 10 \n    elif condition == 'B': \n        result = sum(data) - 5 \n    else: \n        result = sum(data) * 2 \n    return result\",\n\nIf the condition is set to 'A' without changing any data, will the result always be greater than just the sum of the data?",
  "Explanation": "In the scenario where the condition is 'A', the code explicitly adds 10 to the sum of the data, hence, irrespective of the data provided, the result will always be 10 units more than just the sum of the data itself.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
