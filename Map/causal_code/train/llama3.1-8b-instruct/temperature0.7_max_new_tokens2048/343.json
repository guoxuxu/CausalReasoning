  "Explanation": "Turning the heater 'on' increases the base temperature computed under 'cold' weather by 5 degrees, likely moving from 'wear_jacket' to 'normal_clothes' based on the decision function temperature thresholds.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
