  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    modified_data = data * 2\n    final_data = modified_data + 100\n    return final_data\n\ndata = 50\nresult = process_data(data)\nprint(result)\",\n\nIf we set the 'result' to 300 by externally setting 'final_data', will 'data' necessarily reflect this change?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'final_data' or 'result' directly to 300 doesn't change 'data' because the transformation inside the function does not involve reverse computation automatically from 'result' to 'data'. It only flows from 'data' to 'result'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
