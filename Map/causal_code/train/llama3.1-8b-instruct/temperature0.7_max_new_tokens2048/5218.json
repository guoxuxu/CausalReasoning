  "Explanation": "Knowing that hiking is considered good (effect) suggests a low chance of rain, but it doesn't exclusively imply the weather was set to 'sunny', since 'cloudy' weather with a chance of rain at 0.5 could also be considered marginal but acceptable for hiking in some contexts. Without an explicit indication that an intervention aimed to modify the weather, we cannot conclusively backtrack the specific cause based purely on the effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
