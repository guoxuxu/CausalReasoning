  "Explanation": "Increasing 'traffic' might lead to increased 'sales' and thus could potentially improve 'customer_satisfaction'; however, it does not affect 'product_quality', which is an independent variable and not influenced by changes in 'traffic'. Any change in 'product_quality' would need to be addressed separately from traffic adjustments.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
