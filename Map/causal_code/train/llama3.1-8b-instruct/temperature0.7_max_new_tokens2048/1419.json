  "Explanation": "In the provided code, consumer spending adjusts based on the interest rate: a higher rate (>5) leads to reduced spending (investment * 0.75), compared to a lower rate (<=5) which leads to higher spending (investment * 0.85).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
