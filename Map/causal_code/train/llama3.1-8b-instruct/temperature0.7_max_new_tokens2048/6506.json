  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\\\n    x = input_data * 2\\\n    y = x + 4\\\n    if y > 20:\\\n        z = y * 2\\\n    else:\\\n        z = y - 2\\\n    return z\",\n\nIf the output of the function is controlled to return a constant value, does determining whether input_data increased or decreased become easier?",
  "Explanation": "Controlling z to be a constant value would require adjustments to be made either in the input_data or within the internal logic of how y and z are computed, making it complex to directly infer the changes in input_data based just on the constant output. Many combinations of adjustments to y formation and the conditional branches could achieve a constant z, thus obscuring any simple inference about input_data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
