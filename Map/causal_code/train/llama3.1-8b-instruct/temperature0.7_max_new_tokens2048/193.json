  "Explanation": "In the 'addProduct' method, after adding the product to the list, the product's price is immediately updated to include the discount based on the current 'discountRate'. Therefore, any newly added product will have its price adjusted to reflect the discount currently in effect without any further intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
