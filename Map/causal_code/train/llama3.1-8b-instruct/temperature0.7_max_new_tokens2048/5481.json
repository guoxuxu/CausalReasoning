  "Explanation": "Setting 'discount' to 0 in the 'update_discount' method recalculates 'discounted_price' as 'price' multiplied by (1 - 0), which simplifies to the 'price'. Thus, after this intervention, 'discounted_price' is directly equal to 'price'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
