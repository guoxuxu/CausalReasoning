  "Explanation": "Making a teenage individual a student, despite their initial job status, assigns them a bonus of 25 instead of the lower bonuses assigned to non-students or students over 30. This results in a higher total score, demonstrating a direct effect of making someone a student.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
