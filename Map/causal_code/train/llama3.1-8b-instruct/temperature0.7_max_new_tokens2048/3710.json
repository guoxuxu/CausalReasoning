  "Explanation": "The 'adjusted_profit' calculation directly deducts 100 if the city is 'New York'. Changing the city to 'Los Angeles' removes this condition, thus affecting 'adjusted_profit'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
