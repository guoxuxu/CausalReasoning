  "Explanation": "Since user2's high health risk can be reasoned from low activity level (derived from user2 being inactive and older than 30) and a diet quality of 6 (which fits the moderate but not the severe low-quality diet condition), you can infer that the age over 30 contributes to the high health risk, though the primary driver is their low activity level combined with a modestly low diet quality.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
