  "Problem": "class Calculator { constructor(initValue) { this.value = initValue; } add(x) { this.value += x; } subtract(x) { this.value -= x; } getValue() { return this.value; } } const calc = new Calculator(10); calc.add(5); calc.subtract(3); const output = calc.getValue();\",\n\nIf the initial value of the calculator was changed from 10 to 15, would the final output be 17 without using 'subtract' or 'add' after altering the initial value?",
  "Explanation": "The output solely depends on the initial value and subsequent operations applied to it. Altering the initial value to 15 and proceeding with the same operations (add 5 and subtract 3) would result in a final output of (15 + 5 - 3) = 17. The question's condition of not using 'subtract' or 'add' after altering the value isn't followed in the code, thus the result is impacted by these operations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
