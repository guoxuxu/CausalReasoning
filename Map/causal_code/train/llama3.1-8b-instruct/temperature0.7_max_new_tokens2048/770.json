  "Explanation": "This evaluates the causal effect of an intervention (modifying WeatherService to return 30 degrees) which leads to a consistent result (predicting hot weather), showing how changes in the cause directly influence the predictable outcomes in the effect without other unknown interactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
