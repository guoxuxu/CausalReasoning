  "Problem": "{\n    \"code\": \"class WeatherSimulator {\n  int temperature;\n  boolean isRaining;\n\n  public WeatherSimulator(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.isRaining = false;\n  }\n\n  public void updateWeather() {\n    if (temperature > 20) {\n      isRaining = Math.random() > 0.7;\n    } else {\n      isRaining = Math.random() > 0.3;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public boolean willRain() {\n    updateWeather();\n    return isRaining;\n  }\n\n  public void increaseTemperature(int degrees) {\n    temperature += degrees;\n  }\n\n  public void decreaseTemperature(int degrees) {\n    temperature -= degrees;\n  }\n\n  public int getTemperature() {\n    return temperature;\n  }\n\n  public boolean getRainStatus() {\n    return isRaining;\n  }\n}\"\n  },\n\nIf you manually override the temperature to 25 degrees, will it ensure that it does not rain?",
  "Explanation": "While increasing the temperature to 25 degrees lowers the probability of rain (probability of raining needs to be greater than 0.7), it does not guarantee the absence of rain since the decision is dependent on a random generator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
