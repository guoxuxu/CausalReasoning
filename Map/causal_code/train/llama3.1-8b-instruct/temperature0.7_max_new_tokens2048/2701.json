  "Explanation": "If the activity suggested is 'Go hiking', under the conditions of any intervention, it implies either the temperature remained within the thresholds set for hiking (below 80 degrees but above extremely cold conditions), or the intervention didn't significantly affect the weather to shift it out of those conditions. Therefore, we can infer a moderate or no major change was made to the temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
