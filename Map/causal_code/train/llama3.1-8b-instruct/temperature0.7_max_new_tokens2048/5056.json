  "Explanation": "Changing the traffic light to red via the function 'set_traffic_light()' is directly triggered when the number of cars exceed 10 due to 'add_car()' method. This is a backward inference from the change in traffic lights (effect) to the increase in the number of cars above 10 (cause) without an intervention.",
