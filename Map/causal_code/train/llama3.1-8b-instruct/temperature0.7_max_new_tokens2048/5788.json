  "Explanation": "While high response time decreases customer satisfaction, it's not solely responsible for resolution failure because it also depends on agent expertise and the initial level of customer satisfaction.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
