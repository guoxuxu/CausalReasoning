  "Problem": "def analyze_data(data):\n    scores = data['scores']\n    average = sum(scores) / len(scores)\n    \n    if average > 65:\n        outcome = 'pass'\n    else:\n        outcome = 'fail'\n    \n    modification_score = data.get('bonus', 0)\n    adjusted_scores = [s + modification_score for s in scores]\n    adjusted_average = sum(adjusted_scores) / len(adjusted_scores)\n    \n    if adjusted_average > 65:\n        adjusted_outcome = 'pass'\n    else:\n        adjusted_outcome = 'fail'\n    \n    return outcome, adjusted_outcome\",\n\nIf we increase the value of 'bonus', does the adjusted outcome likely switch from 'fail' to 'pass'?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'bonus' raises the adjusted scores, which in turn increases the adjusted average. If the initial 'adjusted_average' is close to 65, increasing the 'bonus' could lead the new adjusted average to surpass 65, changing the adjusted outcome from 'fail' to 'pass'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
