  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, restock, initial_inventory):\n    current_inventory = initial_inventory\n    for sale in sales:\n        if current_inventory > sale:\n            current_inventory -= sale\n        else:\n            current_inventory = 0\n    if restock:\n        current_inventory += 100\n    return current_inventory\",\n\nIf the initial inventory is reduced while all other factors remain constant, will the function potentially return a smaller value?",
  "Explanation": "If the initial inventory is reduced, then after processing the same series of sales, the current inventory will decrease at a faster rate since each sale deduction starts from a smaller base. Therefore, with a smaller initial inventory and without any additional change, the function is likely to return a smaller value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
