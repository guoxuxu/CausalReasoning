  "Explanation": "According to the formula inside the 'predict_next_year_sales' function, 'next_year_sales' is directly influenced by 'marketing_effect', which is 10% of 'marketing_spend'. Increasing 'marketing_spend' will increase the 'marketing_effect', leading to a definite increase in 'next_year_sales', assuming all other variables remain constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
