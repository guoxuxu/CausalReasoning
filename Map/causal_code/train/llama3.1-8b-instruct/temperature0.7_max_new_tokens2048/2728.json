  "Explanation": "The method install_traffic_lights will indeed set traffic_lights to True. However, if the traffic subsequently decreases and remains at 10 or fewer cars, the remove_traffic_lights function will turn off the lights. Hence, intervention by installation does not guarantee the lights remain permanently on.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
