  "Problem": "{\n    \"PythonCode\": \"def process_data(input_data):\n  modified_data = input_data * 2\n  result = modified_data + 10\n  return result\n\ninput_value = 5\nfinal_result = process_data(input_value)\n\nif final_result > 20:\n  output = 'High'\nelse:\n  output = 'Low'\"\n  },\n\nIf we modify the function to add 20 instead of 10, will this ensure a 'High' output for an input_value of 5?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the addition from 10 to 20 in the process_data function modifies the output calculation (5 * 2 + 20 = 30). Since 30 is greater than 20, the output for an input_value of 5 will indeed be 'High'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
