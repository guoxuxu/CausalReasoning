  "Explanation": "The sales jump to 20 only if the resulting increased traffic exceeds 100. If the increased traffic due to an increase in advertising does not exceed 100, the sales jump will be only 5.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
