  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data * 5\n    y = x + 10\n    if y > 50:\n        z = True\n    else:\n        z = False\n    return {'x': x, 'y': y, 'z': z}\n\nresult = process_data(10)\",\n\nIf variable 'z' is True, can we infer that 'data' was definitely more than 8?",
  "Explanation": "Given the logic in the code, 'z' is set to True only if 'y' is greater than 50. Since 'y' is computed as 'data * 5 + 10', for 'y' to be greater than 50, the 'data' needs to be greater than (50 - 10)/5 = 8. Thus, if 'z' is True, it means 'y' is more than 50, implicating 'data' was definitely more than 8.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
