  "Explanation": "Higher ice cream sales indicate higher visitors, but other weather conditions like cloudy can also have a moderate number of visitors. Therefore, simply observing ice cream sales isn't sufficient to conclude sunny weather.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
