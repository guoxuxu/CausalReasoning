  "Explanation": "Given that 'process_data' calculates the mean age based solely on the cleaned data, which includes filtering out individuals under 18, a decrease in the calculated mean age suggests either an increase in the proportion of younger, legally aged individuals or a data error. Since only age-appropriate entries are allowed by the 'clean_data' function, an increase in younger but adult individuals' data in the initial input could lead to this outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
