  "Explanation": "Sunlight positively impacts growth factor as seen from the formula `(temperature * 0.5) + (sunlight * 0.3) + (water_level * 0.2)`, where increasing sunlight directly increases the growth factor, with water_level and temperature kept constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
