  "Explanation": "Disabling error checking won’t affect the conditions under which the machine 'proceeds'. For high-priority printing jobs, removing error checking would not override the necessity to have no errors for proceeding. It would actually result in incorrect handling of real error conditions and potentially larger failures.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
