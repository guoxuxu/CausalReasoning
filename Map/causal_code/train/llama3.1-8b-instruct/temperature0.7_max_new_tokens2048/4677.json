  "Explanation": "The code indicates that the vaccine efficiency is increased by 0.1 when both mask wearing and social distancing are practiced. Thus, enforcing these measures will result in a higher adjusted efficiency during a vaccination drive that targets 70% of the population, leading to a greater percentage of the protected population.",
