  "Explanation": "Raining is based on two conditions: temperature being less than 20 degrees and humidity above 70. Adjusting temperature alone does not set the raining condition directly unless the specific state of humidity is known and conducive.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
