  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulation { private int humidity; private int temperature; public WeatherSimulation(int initialHumidity, int initialTemperature) { this.humidity = initialHumidity; this.temperature = initialTemperature; } public void increaseHumidity(int increment) { this.humidity += increment; if (this.humidity > 90) { this.temperature += 2; } } public int getHumidity() { return humidity; } public int getTemperature() { return temperature; } public void heatUp(int increment) { this.temperature += increment; if (this.temperature > 30) { this.humidity += 5; } } }\",\n\nIf we observe a drop in temperature, can we conclude humidity was manually reduced?",
  "Explanation": "The 'WeatherSimulation' class does not contain a method that directly reduces either temperature or humidity. A drop in temperature observed does not directly indicate manual reduction of humidity since the causal link demonstrating reducing functions is absent in the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
