  "Explanation": "Turning off the heater decreases the current temperature by subtracting 5 from the environment temperature. If the status is 'Too cold', it implies the current temperature is already below the set point. Turning off the heater would further lower the temperature, making it less likely to reach 'Perfect'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
