  "Explanation": "Manually reducing the temperature would affect the method rain, as rain decreases temperature further if humidity is above 70. However, reducing temperature would not influence the heat_wave method's threshold condition (temperature > 30) to decrease humidity, as it is purely dependent on the initial state of temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
