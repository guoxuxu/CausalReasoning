  "Explanation": "Increasing the growth rate with 'implementPolicyChange' directly increases the multiplication factor in 'simulateYear()', therefore boosting the resulting population more than if the intervention had not occurred.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
