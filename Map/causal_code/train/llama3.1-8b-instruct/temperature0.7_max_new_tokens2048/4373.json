  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount percentage directly increases the discount applied to the price, hence decreasing the final price. This follows a clear cause (increase in discount percentage) to effect (decrease in price) relationship without any external intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
