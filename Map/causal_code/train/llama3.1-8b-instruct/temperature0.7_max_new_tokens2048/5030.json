  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { int temperature; bool isRainy; void simulateDay(int seed) { if (seed % 5 == 0) { isRainy = true; } else { isRainy = false; } temperature = (isRainy) ? 16 : 25; } }\",\n\nIf the temperature is intervened to be always 25 degrees, could observing a non-rainy day indicate the seed was not a multiple of 5?",
  "Explanation": "Since the temperature is forced to 25 degrees, 'isRainy' would always be false. In this weather simulator code, 'isRainy' being false implies either an externally set condition or that the seed is not a multiple of 5, which in this intervention scenario confirms that the seed was not a multiple of 5.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The seed directly determines whether it is rainy, and the seed indirectly determines the temperature, which in turn affects whether it is rainy."
