  "Problem": "def compute_statistics(data): \n    mean_val = sum(data) / len(data) \n    data_squared = [x**2 for x in data] \n    mean_squares = sum(data_squared) / len(data) \n    variance = mean_squares - mean_val**2 \n    return mean_val, variance, data_squared\",\n\nIf the `data` list contains more elements, will `mean_val` potentially change?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the number of elements in `data` can affect the sum of the elements, although it might not necessarily change, and since `mean_val` is calculated as the total sum of `data` divided by the number of elements, adding more elements could potentially alter the mean value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
