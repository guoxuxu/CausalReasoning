  "Problem": "A=5; B=10; C=A+B; D=C*2; if B > 5: E=D+10 else: E=D-5\",\n\nIf we set E to be consistently above 40, does this ensure B was greater than 16?",
  "Explanation": "While setting E above 40 indicates D must be significantly higher, since D could account for increments from both A and B, E alone being above 40 doesn't ensure B is specifically greater than 16 without knowing the value of A.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
