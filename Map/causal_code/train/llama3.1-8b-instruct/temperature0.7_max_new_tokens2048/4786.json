  "Problem": "def compute(x, y):\n    a = x * 5\n    b = y + 3\n    c = a + b\n    d = c * 2\n    return d\",\n\nIf b is reduced, can the effect on x be determined by observing changes in d?",
  "Explanation": "While reducing b will impact c (because c = a + b) and in turn d (because d = c * 2), this effect does not provide information about x. The relationship between b and x is not direct or inverse in the given code; x affects a and through it c and d but changing b and observing d does not provide insights into changes in x.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
