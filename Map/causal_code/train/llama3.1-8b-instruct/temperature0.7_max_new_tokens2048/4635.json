  "Explanation": "The function scales up the sensor_value by a factor of 1.05 and adds 5 when the sensor_reading is above 100. Increasing the sensor_value (when already over 100) linearly increases the adjusted_temperature as both the multiplication by 1.05 and the addition of 5 continue to apply.",
