  "Explanation": "The message 'Value is below threshold.' is printed when the 'outcome' is 'Low'. This occurs when 'adjusted_data' (10 times 'data_input') is 50 or less, implying that 'data_input' must have been 5 or less.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
