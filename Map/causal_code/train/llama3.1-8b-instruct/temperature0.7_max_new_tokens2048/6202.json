  "Problem": "def classify_student(scores): \n    if scores['math'] > 90 and scores['science'] > 85: \n        return 'high' \n    elif scores['math'] < 60 or scores['science'] < 60: \n        return 'low' \n    else: \n        return 'average'\",\n\nIf a policy is introduced to boost science scores with intensive coaching and a student’s classification changes to 'high', were their original science scores likely below 85?",
  "Explanation": "Since the classification changed to 'high' following an intervention in science scores, it indicates that initially the student's science scores were inadequate for this high classification (i.e., below 85).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
