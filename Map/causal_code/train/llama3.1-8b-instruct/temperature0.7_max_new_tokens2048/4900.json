  "Explanation": "A decrease in `room_temp` can happen if `heater_on` is False and `room_temp` is greater than `target_temp`. However, a stable or unchanged `room_temp` can also occur with `heater_on` being False if `room_temp` equals `target_temp`. Thus, observing a decrease in `room_temp` does not definitively indicate that `heater_on` was False without considering `target_temp`.",
