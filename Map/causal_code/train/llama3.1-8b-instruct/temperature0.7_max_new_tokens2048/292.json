  "Explanation": "Even with improvements in diet and exercise, the age factor independently reduces the health index for those over 50. Thus, younger individuals might generally have higher indices due to the absence of the age penalty, but this isn't necessarily universal as scores depend on the specific values of diet and exercise as well.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
