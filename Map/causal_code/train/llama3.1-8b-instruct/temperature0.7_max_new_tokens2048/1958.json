  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'views' in data and 'likes' in data: \n        popularity = data['views'] * data['likes'] \n        if popularity > 10000: \n            result = 'High' \n        else: \n            result = 'Low' \n    else: \n        result = 'Unknown' \n    return result\",\n\nIf the result is 'High', does it necessarily mean that the views were high?",
  "Explanation": "A 'High' result means the product of views and likes exceed 10000. This can happen even if the views are not particularly high, as long as the number of likes is sufficient to raise the product above 10000.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
