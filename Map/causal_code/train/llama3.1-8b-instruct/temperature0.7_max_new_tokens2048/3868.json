  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\n    noisy_data = input_data + 10\n    filtered_data = noisy_data - 5\n    processed_data = filtered_data * 2\n    return processed_data\",\n\nIf we modify the operation by subtracting 15 instead of 5 from noisy_data, will this affect processed_data?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the subtraction operation impacts filtered_data, which is directly used to compute processed_data. A subtraction of 15 instead of 5 decreases filtered_data and thus decreases processed_data, showcasing the direct intervention's impact.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
