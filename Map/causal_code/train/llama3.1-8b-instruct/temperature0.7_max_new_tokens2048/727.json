If 'invest_more' is found to be False, can it be concluded the business wasn't profitable to begin with?",
  "Explanation": "Given the hypothetical intervention that sets 'invest_more' to False for profitable businesses, the status of 'invest_more' being False cannot conclusively determine the unprofitability of the business. Under the new policy, profitable businesses will also have 'invest_more' set to False, confusing the original causal connection.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
