  "Problem": "def compute_health_index(age, smoking_status, exercise_freq, diet_quality):\n    base_health = 100\n    age_penalty = age * 0.5\n    smoke_penalty = 20 if smoking_status else 0\n    exercise_bonus = 10 * exercise_freq\n    diet_bonus = 5 * diet_quality\n    health_index = base_health - age_penalty + exercise_bonus + diet_bonus - smoke_penalty\n    return health_index\",\n\nIf we implement a policy that encourages more frequent exercise, will this lead to an increase in the health index?",
  "Explanation": "Since the health_index calculation adds an 'exercise_bonus' that is a product of the exercise frequency, increasing the exercise frequency through intervention would directly increase the exercise bonus, leading to a higher overall health index.",
