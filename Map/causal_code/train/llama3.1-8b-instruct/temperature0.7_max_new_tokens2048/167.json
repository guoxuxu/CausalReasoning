  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    modified = data * 2\n    if modified > 20:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    return result\",\n\nIf we modify the code to add 10 to the data before doubling, will an input value of 8 lead to a result of True?",
  "Explanation": "With the code modification of adding 10 before doubling, an input of 8 becomes 18 when modified (8 + 10), and then 36 when doubled. Because 36 is greater than 20, the result would be True.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
