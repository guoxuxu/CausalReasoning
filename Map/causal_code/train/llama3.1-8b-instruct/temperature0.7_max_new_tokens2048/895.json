  "Explanation": "If the score is reduced to 55, below the baseline of 70 for temperatures above 20, it can be inferred that the adjustment which would raise the score by 15 points was not applied, because there's no other construct within the given code to explain a score of 55 under the specified conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
