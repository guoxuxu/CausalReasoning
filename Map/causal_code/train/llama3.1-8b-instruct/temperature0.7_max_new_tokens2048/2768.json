  "Problem": "class SystemHealthChecker {\n  private boolean isCpuOverloaded;\n  private boolean isMemoryFull;\n  private boolean notificationSent;\n\n  public SystemHealthChecker(boolean cpuStatus, boolean memoryStatus) {\n    isCpuOverloaded = cpuStatus;\n    isMemoryFull = memoryStatus;\n    notificationSent = false;\n  }\n\n  public void checkSystemHealth() {\n    if (isCpuOverloaded || isMemoryFull) {\n      sendNotification();\n    }\n  }\n\n  private void sendNotification() {\n    notificationSent = true;\n  }\n\n  public boolean isNotificationSent() {\n    return notificationSent;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf we reset the CPU status to not overloaded during system check, will a notification still be sent in the case of full memory?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by setting 'isCpuOverloaded' to false and checking 'isMemoryFull' to be true means that the system check condition '(isCpuOverloaded || isMemoryFull)' still returns true if the memory is full. Thus, a notification will still be sent when memory is full, independent of the CPU status after the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
