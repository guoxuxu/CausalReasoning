  "Explanation": "While fertilizer does increase the yield, the ambiguity in the amount of increase due to the unknown contributions from sunlight and rain means the increase can't be solely attributed to the fertilizer without additional data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
