  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    data['adjusted'] = data['original'] * 1.2 \n    if data['environment'] == 'urban': \n        data['final'] = data['adjusted'] + 20 \n    else: \n        data['final'] = data['adjusted'] - 10 \n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'original' value increases, will the 'final' value increase without any other intervention in an urban environment?",
  "Explanation": "The final value is directly dependent on the 'adjusted' value, which in turn is calculated as 1.2 times the 'original' value. In an urban environment, 20 is added to the 'adjusted' value, so an increase in 'original' will proportionally increase 'final'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
