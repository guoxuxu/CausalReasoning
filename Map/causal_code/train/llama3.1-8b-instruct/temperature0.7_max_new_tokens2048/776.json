  "Explanation": "In the given code, the 'status' field is set to 'success' if there is no 'error' keyword found in the data dictionary. The code explicitly checks for the absence of 'error' to set the status. This is a case from cause (no error in data) to effect (status is success) without any intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
