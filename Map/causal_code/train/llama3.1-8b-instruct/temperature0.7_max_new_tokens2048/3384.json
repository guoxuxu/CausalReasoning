Additionally, interest is accrued at a fixed rate whenever a balance check is requested.\",\n    \"code\": \"\"\"\nclass BankAccount:\n    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):\n        self.owner = owner\n        self.balance = balance\n        self.interest_rate = 0.05\n    \n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0:\n            self.balance += amount\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n    \n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount > 0 and self.balance >= amount:\n            self.balance -= amount\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n\n    def add_interest(self):\n        self.balance += self.balance * self.interest_rate\n\n    def check_balance(self):\n        self.add_interest()\n        return self.balance\n\"\"\",\n\nIf a user increases the initial deposit, will that lead to a higher balance at the next check_balance() call?",
  "Explanation": "Higher initial deposits boost the baseline of balance prior to the calculation of interests, which increases subsequently through interest calculation during balance check.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
