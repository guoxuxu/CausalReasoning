  "Explanation": "If scores are uniformly increased, both filtered and non-filtered entries are affected, which alters the mean. This modification distorts the relationship between the original data and the 'filter_threshold' and thus one cannot accurately infer the original 'filter_threshold' solely based on the new mean.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
