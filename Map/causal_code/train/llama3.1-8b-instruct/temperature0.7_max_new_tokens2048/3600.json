  "Explanation": "Using centimeters rather than meters (i.e., a factor of 100 increase) in the BMI formula without adjusting for unit difference would result in a BMI value that is erroneously smaller, due to the square of the height greatly increasing in the denominator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
