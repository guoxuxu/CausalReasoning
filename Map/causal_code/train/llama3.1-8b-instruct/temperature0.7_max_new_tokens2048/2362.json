The weather can be predicted as 'Rain', 'Sunny', or 'Cloudy'.\"\n  },\n\nIf a deliberate change is made to report lower temperatures, and the predicted weather still shows 'Rain', what can be inferred about the original humidity level?",
  "Explanation": "Reporting a lower temperature should technically switch the prediction from 'Rain' to either 'Sunny' or 'Cloudy' since 'Rain' requires the temperature to be above 30. If it still predicts 'Rain', this indicates an error in the temperature modification or in the original assumptions about required temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
