  "Explanation": "For a user logged in as 'admin' with the correct password, the user_type is set to 'admin', and 'perform_action' for 'admin' is exclusively 'delete database'. 'View data' is only available to user_type 'user'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
