  "Explanation": "Although 'final_result' is determined by the maximum of 'results', which in turn are influenced by 'thresholds', observing 'final_result' alone doesn't provide direct information on how 'thresholds' were individually set or changed. 'final_result' only reveals the highest average obtained; without additional data, we cannot ascertain specific changes in 'thresholds'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
