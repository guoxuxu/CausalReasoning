  "Problem": "def update_inventory(item_sales, inventory_counts):\n    for item, sold in item_sales.items():\n        if item in inventory_counts:\n            inventory_counts[item] -= sold\n    return inventory_counts\",\n\nIf the inventory count of an item is reduced, does it imply that the sales of that item have increased?",
  "Explanation": "While the decrease in inventory count does suggest that some items were sold, it does not necessarily imply an increase in sales. The inventory might have been reduced exactly proportional to the sales, or other factors like inventory errors or damage could be involved.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
