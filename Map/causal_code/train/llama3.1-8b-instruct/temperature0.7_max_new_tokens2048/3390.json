  "Problem": "def process_data(data, mode):\n    if mode == 'normalize':\n        max_val = max(data)\n        return [x / max_val for x in data]\n    elif mode == 'standardize':\n        mean_val = sum(data) / len(data)\n        std_dev = (sum((x - mean_val) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)) ** 0.5\n        return [(x - mean_val) / std_dev for x in data]\n    else:\n        return data\",\n\nIf the mode is set to 'normalize', will the data always be transformed?",
  "Explanation": "When the mode is 'normalize', the data undergoes a transformation where each element is divided by the maximum value of the dataset, effectively scaling all the data points between 0 and 1. Therefore, the data is always transformed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
