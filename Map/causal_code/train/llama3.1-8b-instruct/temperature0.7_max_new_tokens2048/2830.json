  "Problem": "def calculate_health_index(smoking, exercise_hours, diet_quality):\n    base_health = 100\n    if smoking:\n        base_health -= 30\n    base_health += (exercise_hours * 2)\n    if diet_quality == 'good':\n        base_health += 20\n    elif diet_quality == 'poor':\n        base_health -= 20\n    return base_health\",\n\nIf a person starts smoking, will the health index decrease?",
  "Explanation": "In the provided code, when the 'smoking' variable is True ('if smoking:'), the base health is decreased by 30. This directly shows a causal relationship where smoking (cause) leads to a decrease in health index (effect) without any further intervention needed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
