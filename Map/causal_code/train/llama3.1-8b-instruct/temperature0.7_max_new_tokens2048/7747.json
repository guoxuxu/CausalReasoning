  "Explanation": "Adjusting the lowest possible score increases the overall range and floor for average calculations. This intervention is likely to shift borderline average scores over the threshold values (e.g., from just below 70 to just above), thereby slightly improving the final summary grades of some students at the lower end.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
