  "Explanation": "The code explicitly intervenes to increase the sales by 50 whenever the weather is rainy. This directly increases the mean of the sales distribution for rainy days, thus effectively increasing the average sales as per the implementation of 'improve_sales_on_rainy_days' function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
