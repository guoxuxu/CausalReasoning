  "Explanation": "Intervening by modifying data_sequence to only include values greater than 8 ensures that all values in processed_data, being tripled, are significantly high (all greater than 24), thereby increasing the average computed in analyze_data. This is a direct result of the intervention leading to higher values being fed into the process_data function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
