  "Explanation": "In the given code, the air conditioner state changes only when `toggleAirConditioner` is explicitly called or when `decreaseTemperature` method is triggered and the temperature drops to 25 or below, which then turns off the air conditioner. Natural increase in temperature does not directly influence the air conditioner state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
