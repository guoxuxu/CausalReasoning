  "Explanation": "A decrease in the average score usually indicates either the scores of one or more active students were reduced, or an active student was set to inactive, as these are the primary ways the average calculation can be affected per the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
