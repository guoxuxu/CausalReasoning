  "Explanation": "The intervention could either decrease the 'current_stock' or increase the 'stock_threshold', both of which could make 'restock_check' return True. Therefore, the exact nature of the intervention (decrease in stock vs. increase in threshold) cannot be conclusively determined just from the return value of True.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
