  "Explanation": "Since the number of hospitals is incremented when a critical patient is discharged (based on the condition check in discharge_patient method), an increase in the number of available hospitals likely indicates more discharging of critical patients.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
