  "Problem": "{\n        \"python\": [\n            \"def calculate_temperature(feels_like, humidity, umbrella_used):\",\n            \"    base_temperature = feels_like - 0.3 * humidity\",\n            \"    if umbrella_used:\",\n            \"        sensed_temperature = base_temperature + 2\",\n            \"    else:\",\n            \"        sensed_temperature = base_temperature\",\n            \"    return sensed_temperature\"\n        ]\n    },\n\nIf we decide to use an umbrella, will that action alone cause the sensed temperature to be higher?",
  "Explanation": "The use of an umbrella directly induces an increase of 2 units in the sensed temperature, irrespective of other variables, as shown by the conditional in the code 'if umbrella_used: sensed_temperature = base_temperature + 2'.",
