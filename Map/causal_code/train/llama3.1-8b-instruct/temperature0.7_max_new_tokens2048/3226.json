  "Problem": "class TrafficSystem { constructor() { this.signal = 'red'; this.cars = 0; } changeSignal(newSignal) { this.signal = newSignal; } updateCars(count) { this.cars += count; } canDrive() { return this.signal === 'green'; } } const cityTraffic = new TrafficSystem(); cityTraffic.changeSignal('green'); cityTraffic.updateCars(5); const isDrivingPossible = cityTraffic.canDrive();\",\n\nIf the signal is set to 'green', will cars be able to drive?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the signal to 'green' directly allows cars to drive since the 'canDrive' method checks if the signal is 'green'. Changing the signal influences car movement ability directly without any other intervention, hence it's a cause to effect scenario without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
