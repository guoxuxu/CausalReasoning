  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  private int temperature;\n  private boolean isRaining;\n\n  public WeatherSimulator(int temperature, boolean isRaining) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.isRaining = isRaining;\n  }\n\n  public void setTemperature(int newTemp) {\n    temperature = newTemp;\n    if (temperature < 0) {\n      isRaining = false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public boolean getIsRaining() {\n    return isRaining;\n  }\n\n  public void causeStorm() {\n    if (temperature > 32) {\n      isRaining = true;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nDoes the occurrence of rain necessarily imply that the temperature is above 32 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "Rain can be caused in the code through method `causeStorm` only if temperature is above 32 degrees, but there is no code segment that restricts rain to exclusively occur when temperature is above 32. Rain can be initially true when the simulator is created with it being true, irrespective of the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
