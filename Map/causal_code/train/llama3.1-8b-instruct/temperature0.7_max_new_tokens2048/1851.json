  "Problem": "int processOrder(int quantity, bool isMember) { if (isMember) { return quantity * 2; } else { return quantity; } }\",\n\nIf we were to change a user’s status to a member, would every order necessarily have its value doubled compared to its original value?",
  "Explanation": "Changing a user’s status to 'member' triggers the conditional branch in the code that multiplies the quantity by 2, effectively doubling the value of every order processed compared to if the user were not a member. This doubling effect is explicitly defined in the code for members.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
