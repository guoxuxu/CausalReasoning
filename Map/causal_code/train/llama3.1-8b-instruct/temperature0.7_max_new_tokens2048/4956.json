  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, stock, discount_factor):\n    if discount_factor > 0.5:\n        discount = price * 0.10\n    else:\n        discount = price * discount_factor\n    final_price = price - discount\n    total_sales = final_price * stock\n    return total_sales\",\n\nDid a high total_sales result from a high discount_factor?",
  "Explanation": "A high total_sales does not directly result from a high discount_factor. While a higher discount can increase sales through lower price, the discount is capped at 10% when discount_factor is above 0.5, thus a high discount_factor above 0.5 doesn't lead to further reduction in price than already permitted by the cap.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A high discount_factor leads to a high discount, which in turn leads to a high final_price, and subsequently results in a high total_sales."
