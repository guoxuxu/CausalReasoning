  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(price, advertising, day_of_week):\n    if day_of_week == 'Sunday':\n        sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.2) * 1.5\n    else:\n        sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.1)\n    return sales\",\n\nDoes a change in sales necessarily imply a change in the day of the week?",
  "Explanation": "While sales can be higher on Sundays due to the multiplier effect, sales changes can also occur from changes in price or advertising without any influence from the day of the week.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
