  "Explanation": "The code specifies that for plants other than 'Cactus', providing more water (more than 50 units) will increase the growth rate of the plant. In the case of a Flower plant with sufficient sunlight, its growth rate will indeed increase when watered significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
