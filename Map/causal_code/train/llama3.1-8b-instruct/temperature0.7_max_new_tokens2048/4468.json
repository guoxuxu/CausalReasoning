  "Problem": "\n    sales = 100\n    season = 'winter'\n    discount = 0.2\n    if season == 'winter':\n        sales += 50\n    else:\n        sales -= 10\n    final_price = 200 * (1 - discount)\n    if sales > 120:\n        final_price *= 0.9\n    \"\"\",\n\nIf the final price is reduced, does it indicate that it's winter?",
  "Explanation": "The final price only gets a 10% reduction (multiplied by 0.9) if sales exceed 120, which only happens in the winter scenario as per the code, where sales reach 150.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
