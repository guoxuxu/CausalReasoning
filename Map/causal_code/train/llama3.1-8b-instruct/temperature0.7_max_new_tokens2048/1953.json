  "Explanation": "The heater turning on depends not only on the decrease in `temp_outside` but also on its comparison to a threshold (desired_temp). If `temp_outside` is still above the desired_temp, the heater won't turn on.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
