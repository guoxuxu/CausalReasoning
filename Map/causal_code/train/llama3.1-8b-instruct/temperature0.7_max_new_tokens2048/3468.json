  "Explanation": "By intervening to set the activity to 'stay home and read', we eliminate the influence of weather on the activity decision. Since the decide_attire() function solely depends on the activity, and for 'stay home and read' the attire is always 'comfortable clothing', this intervention ensures that the attire will always be as specified, independent of any weather conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
