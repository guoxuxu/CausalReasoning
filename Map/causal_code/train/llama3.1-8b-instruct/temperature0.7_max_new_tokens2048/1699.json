  "Explanation": "When the quiz consists of more than 5 questions, each student’s stress level is increased by 1. Consequently, teachers evaluating student performance may observe increased stress levels, especially for those students whose stress levels exceed a certain threshold (level 2 in this scenario).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "length of questions → increased stress in students; increased stress in students → teacher observes increased stress in students"
