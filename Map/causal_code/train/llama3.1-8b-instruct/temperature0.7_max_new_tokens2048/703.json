  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data['value1'] + data['value2']\n    if x > 50:\n        status = 'High'\n    else:\n        status = 'Low'\n    y = x * 2\n    return {'x': x, 'status': status, 'y': y}\",\n\nIf there is an intervention to increase 'value2' by 10, will this change the value of 'y'?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'value2' will increase 'x', because 'x' is the sum of 'value1' and 'value2'. Since 'y' is calculated as 'x' times 2, increasing 'x' will lead to an increase in 'y'. Thus, 'y' is dependent on the value of 'x' which is directly influenced by changes in 'value2'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
