  "Explanation": "Just because people are using umbrellas does not necessarily mean it is raining, as the check ‘isRaining’ requires both rainfall occurrence and temperature above zero. Therefore, people might still use umbrellas because it was raining moments ago or anticipating rain despite the current weather condition not strictly involving active rainfall.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
