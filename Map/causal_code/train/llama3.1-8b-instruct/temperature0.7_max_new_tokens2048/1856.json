  "Problem": "Described above in text section.\",\n\nIf the reported activity is 'hiking', and we then cool down the environment significantly, can we infer the mood was initially 'bored'?",
  "Explanation": "The only condition under which 'hiking' is chosen is if it's not hot, the mood is 'bored', and there is more than 2 hours available. By cooling the environment making it not hot, and seeing 'hiking' still occurs, it supports the inference that the initial condition included a 'bored' mood since temperature and available time are controlled.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Cooling environment → Lower temperature; Lower temperature → Reduced physical activity; Reduced physical activity → Engaged in hiking; Engaged in hiking → Initially bored mood"
