  "Explanation": "An increase in total sales could have multiple causes, such as more sales volume or other promotions. Reversing the increase in prices would generally not directly increase sales unless accompanied by other variables like increased demand.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
