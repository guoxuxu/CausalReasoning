  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    if flag > 0:\n        result = sum(data) + 10\n    else:\n        result = sum(data) - 5\n    return result\n\ndata_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nflag_value = 3\noutput = process_data(data_list, flag_value)\",\n\nIf flag_value is set to 0 intentionally, will the output decrease compared to its initial value?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'flag_value' to 0 changes the branch of the conditional in 'process_data', activating the else clause. This clause subtracts 5 from the sum of 'data_list' rather than adding 10, leading to a reduced output compared to when 'flag_value' is positive. This question checks understanding of 'from cause to effect with intervention,' where the intervention is the manual adjustment of 'flag_value'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
