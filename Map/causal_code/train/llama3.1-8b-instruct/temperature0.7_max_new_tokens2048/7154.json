  "Problem": "def compute(a, b): \n    x = a * 2 \n    y = b + 5 \n    z = x + y \n    w = z - 3 \n    return w\",\n\nDoes increasing the return value of the 'compute' function imply an increase in the input value 'b'?",
  "Explanation": "Although increasing 'b' will increase 'y' (since y = b + 5) and hence increase 'z' and 'w', the return value 'w' can also be increased by manipulating 'a'. Therefore, an increase in 'w' does not distinctly imply an increase in 'b' since the increase could as well derive from 'a'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
