  "Problem": "def process_data(data, threshold, flag): \n    if flag: \n        modified_data = [x * 2 for x in data] \n    else: \n        modified_data = [x / 2 for x in data] \n    result = [] \n    for value in modified_data: \n        if value > threshold: \n            result.append(True) \n        else: \n            result.append(False) \n    return result\",\n\nIf the 'threshold' value is reduced, will it likely increase the number of True values in the result list without any intervention on 'flag' or 'data'?",
  "Explanation": "Reducing the 'threshold' value decreases the criterion for appending True to the result list. Consequently, more elements in 'modified_data' will satisfy the condition (value > threshold), leading to more True values in the result. This assessment assumes no changes are made to 'flag' or 'data'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
