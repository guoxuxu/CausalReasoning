  "Explanation": "Increased sales can be caused by changes in other variables such as the advertising budget or seasonal effects related to specific fixed months, and not necessarily due to the change of the month. The method 'predict_sales' adds various components, including seasonal and advertising effects, which do not singularly depend on a change of month.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
