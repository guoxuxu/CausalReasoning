  "Problem": "See above Python code\",\n\nIf the view_count reaches 150 without any admin intervention, will the content still be visible?",
  "Explanation": "The update_visibility method sets content visibility to True when view_count is 100 or more. Since 150 is above this threshold, the content remains visible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
