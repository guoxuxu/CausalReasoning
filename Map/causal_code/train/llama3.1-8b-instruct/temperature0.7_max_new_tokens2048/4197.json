  "Explanation": "With the intervention where 'predict_sales' always returns a constant value (1000), observing changes in this output tells us nothing about the underlying 'base_sales', as the output is explicitly decoupled from 'base_sales' due to the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A change in 'base_sales' would not reveal changes in the output of 'predict_sales' if the intervention always returns 1000, as the output of 'predict_sales' is no longer dependent on 'base_sales'."
