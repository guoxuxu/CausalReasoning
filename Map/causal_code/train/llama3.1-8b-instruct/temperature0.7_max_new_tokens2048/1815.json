  "Problem": "import random\n\n# Initialize variables\nseason = 'winter'  # or 'summer'\nsales = 0\nadvertising_budget = 5000\n\n# Simulate effect of season\nif season == 'summer':\n    sales += 120\nelse:\n    sales += 80\n\n# Simulate effect of advertising\nsales += advertising_budget * 0.02\n\n# Random fluctuations\nsales += random.randint(-10, 10)\n\nprint(f'Total sales: {sales}')\",\n\nIf the advertising budget is increased, will this definitely lead to an increase in sales?",
  "Explanation": "The code shows a linear relationship where each unit of advertising budget increases sales by 0.02. Therefore, increasing the advertising budget will unequivocally increase sales, notwithstanding the season or random fluctuations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
