  "Explanation": "In the code, the accelerate method increases the speed by the exact value of 'increase' if the vehicle is not electric (fuel is not 'electric'). Therefore, accelerating by any fixed amount does indeed increase the speed directly by that amount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
