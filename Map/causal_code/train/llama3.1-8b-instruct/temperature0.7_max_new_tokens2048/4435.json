  "Explanation": "Setting 'show_favorite' to False stabilizes the magic_number at 5. Since there’s no random addition, the calculation within 'perform_magic' becomes deterministic, resulting in a consistent final_score of 20 (5 * 2 = 10 + 10).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
