  "Explanation": "Since the decision to wear a 't-shirt' is solely dependent on the environment being 'warm', and 'warm' is set only if the temperature is above 20 degrees, a 't-shirt' outfit directly indicates that temperature was indeed above 20.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
