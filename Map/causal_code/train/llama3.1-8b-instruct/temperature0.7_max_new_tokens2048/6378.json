  "Explanation": "If more products meet the bonus_threshold unexpectedly, it could be caused by either an intervention that increased the sales figures or an adjustment (reduction) of the bonus_threshold, making it easier for products to meet the criteria.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in product sales can lead to an increase in the total sales, which in turn can lead to a higher average sales, and subsequently, more products meeting the bonus threshold."
