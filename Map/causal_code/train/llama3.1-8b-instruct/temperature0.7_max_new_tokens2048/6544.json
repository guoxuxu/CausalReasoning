  "Problem": "def process_data(data_list):\n    even_numbers = [x for x in data_list if x % 2 == 0]\n    mean_even = sum(even_numbers) / len(even_numbers) if even_numbers else None\n    adjusted_numbers = [x * 2 if x > 5 else x + 1 for x in data_list]\n    return sum(adjusted_numbers), mean_even\",\n\nCan you confirm the increase in mean_even has resulted from an increase in the quantity of even numbers within the data_list?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in mean_even directly indicates either an increase in the sum of even numbers or a reduction in their count without a proportionate decrease in sum. Given that mean_even is directly calculated from even_numbers, it is reasonable to infer this causal relationship.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
