  "Explanation": "When an item is added and the same item is then removed, itemCount increments initially with addItem and decrements with removeItem, ultimately leaving itemCount unchanged. Therefore, itemCount returns to its original state before the interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
