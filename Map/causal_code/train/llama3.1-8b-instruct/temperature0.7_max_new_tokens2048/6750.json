  "Explanation": "The heat index is calculated based on both temperature and humidity. The formula `heat_index = self.temperature + 0.5 * self.humidity - 10` shows a direct relation where if temperature increases, the heat index will also increase, assuming humidity remains constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
