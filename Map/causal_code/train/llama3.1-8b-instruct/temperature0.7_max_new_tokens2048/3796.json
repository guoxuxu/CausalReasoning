  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount rate and then applying it will result in a larger price reduction per item, thereby reducing the total computed by `total_sales()` compared to if the discount rate had not been adjusted.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
