  "Explanation": "A drop in sales implies fewer ads are running, indicating that a lesser amount of the budget was allocated to ads, possibly due to an intervention reallocating budget away from ad spend.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
