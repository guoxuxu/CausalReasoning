  "Explanation": "While fixing income a higher level increases sales, the actual effect on ROI depends on how profit reacts relative to marketing_spend. If profit doesn’t increase proportionally greater than the marketing_spend, ROI may not necessarily improve.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
