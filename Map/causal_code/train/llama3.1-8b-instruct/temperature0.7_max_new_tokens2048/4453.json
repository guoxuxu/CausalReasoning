  "Problem": "\n  # Python program to decide promotions based on sales performance and seniority\n\n  class Employee:\n      def __init__(self, name, sales, years_of_service):\n          self.name = name\n          self.sales = sales\n          self.years_of_service = years_of_service\n          self.promotion_status = 'No'\n\n      def evaluate_promotion(self):\n          if self.sales > 100 and self.years_of_service > 3:\n              self.promotion_status = 'Yes'\n          elif self.sales > 150:\n              self.promotion_status = 'Yes'\n\n  # Example Employees\n  alice = Employee('Alice', 120, 4)\n  bob = Employee('Bob', 160, 2)\n  alice.evaluate_promotion()\n  bob.evaluate_promotion()\n  \"\"\",\n\nIf the promotion criterion changes to require more than 5 years of service regardless of sales, will Alice still be promoted?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the promotion criteria to require more than 5 years of service affects Alice's promotion status negatively because she only has 4 years of service. Thus, even with sufficient sales, she would not meet this new criterion.",
