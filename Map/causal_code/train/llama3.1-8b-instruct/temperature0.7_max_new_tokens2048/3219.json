  "Explanation": "Though high rain probability (80%) occurs with a temperature below 20 when humidity is above 70, it's not the only condition for such probability—it could also happen at different temperatures with alternative logic paths (modifications or other conditions) not shown in this specific code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
