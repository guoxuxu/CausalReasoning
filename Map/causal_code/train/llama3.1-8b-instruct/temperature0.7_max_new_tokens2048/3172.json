  "Problem": "[See above Python code snippet]\",\n\nIf a user manually adjusts the water supply, applying more water than usual, can this ensure increased plant growth?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by increasing the water supply is likely to boost plant growth, especially if the sunlight level is also favorable (above 50).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
