  "Explanation": "A lower correlation result can be caused by many factors other than the lack of normalization, such as the inherent nature of the data or the sequence in which data points are arranged. While normalization could affect the correlation, it is not the sole determinant.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
