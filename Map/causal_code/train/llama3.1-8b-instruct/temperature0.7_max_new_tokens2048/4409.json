  "Explanation": "Intervening by scaling up the multiplication factor amplifies each data point more significantly, increasing 'transformed_data' values, which consequently increases 'data_sum'. This results in a higher probability of 'data_sum' surpassing the threshold, making 'final_value' exceed 100.",
