  "Problem": "provided above\",\n\nIf industrial activity increases, will health issues necessarily increase without any change to other variables?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing industrial activity directly increases pollution, which influences weather severity. However, health issues are impacted not only by weather severity but also by public health funding. Since public health funding can counteract the negative impact of worse weather, health issues do not necessarily increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
