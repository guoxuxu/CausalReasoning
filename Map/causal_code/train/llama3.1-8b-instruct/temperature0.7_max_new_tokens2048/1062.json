  "Explanation": "Setting the age to 30 changes the 'adult' flag to True (if not already set) which is a precondition for checking the income to determine the 'tax_bracket'. If the person's income also satisfies the income condition (>100000), their tax bracket will definitively be affected.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
