  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data):\n    sales = sum(item['sales'] for item in data)\n    losses = sum(item['loss'] for item in data)\n    profit = sales - losses\n    tax = 0.2 * profit if profit > 0 else 0\n    net_profit = profit - tax\n    return {'sales': sales, 'losses': losses, 'profit': profit, 'net_profit': net_profit}\",\n\nIf the net_profit decreased, can we definitely say that losses increased without accessing more data?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in `net_profit` could be due to either an increase in `losses`, a decrease in `sales`, or both. Without more detailed data on `sales` and `losses`, it is not possible to attribute the cause solely to an increase in `losses`.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
