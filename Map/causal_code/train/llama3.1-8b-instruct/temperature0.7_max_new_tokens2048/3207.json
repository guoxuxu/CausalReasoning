  "Problem": "def calculateInterest(balance, rate): \n    if balance > 1000: \n        interest = balance * (rate / 100) \n    else: \n        interest = balance * (rate / 2 / 100) \n    return interest\",\n\nIf the calculated interest decreases, does this imply that the balance decreased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in calculated interest could result from either a decreased balance or a reduced rate. Hence, it's not certain the balance decreased just from the observation of decreased interest.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
