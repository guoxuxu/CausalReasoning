  "Explanation": "Assuming an intervention where an external function removes 'error' from the data, the 'status' would automatically be set to 'success.' Consequently, this success status would induce the setting of 'processed' to True, demonstrating the effect of an intervening action from cause to effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
