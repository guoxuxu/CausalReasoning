  "Explanation": "Sunlight has a strong positive effect on the growth rate calculation. Increasing sunlight, while keeping water and fertilizer constant, will definitely increase the growth rate of a 'Fern', particularly given its higher multiplier from the species-specific function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
