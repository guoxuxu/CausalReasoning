  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'weather' in data:\n        rain = data['weather'].get('rain', 0)\n        if rain > 20:\n            traffic_delay = 1.5\n        else:\n            traffic_delay = 1.0\n    else:\n        traffic_delay = 1.0\n    if 'special_event' in data:\n        traffic_delay *= 2\n    data['traffic_delay'] = traffic_delay\n    return data\",\n\nIf there is more than 20mm of rain, will the traffic delay be different compared to when there is less or no rain, assuming no special event?",
  "Explanation": "The function includes a conditional check for rain. If rain exceeds 20mm, the traffic delay multiplier is set to 1.5 instead of 1.0. Thus, with more than 20mm of rain, traffic delay is higher without considering any intervention like a special event.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
