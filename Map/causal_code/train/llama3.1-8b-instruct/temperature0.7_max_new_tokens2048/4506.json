  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data):\n    temperature = data['temp']\n    humidity = data['humidity']\n    adjusted_temp = temperature * 1.05 if humidity > 50 else temperature\n    return {'adjusted_temperature': adjusted_temp, 'is_comfortable': adjusted_temp < 22 and humidity < 50}\",\n\nIf the outcome indicates that it is not comfortable, can we deduce that humidity was intervened and set above 50?",
  "Explanation": "The comfort level being reported as not comfortable does not necessarily mean that humidity was altered and set above 50. The comfort status depends on both temperature staying below 22 after any adjustment and humidity being less than 50. Several combinations, including untouched or unchanged high humidity, or temperatures resulting in an adjusted temperature over 22, could lead to discomfort without any specific intervention on humidity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
