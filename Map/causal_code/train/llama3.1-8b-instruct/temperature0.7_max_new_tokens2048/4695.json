  "Problem": "def update_sales(records, product, percentage_increase):\n    if product in records:\n        records[product] *= (1 + percentage_increase / 100)\n    return records\n\nsales_records = {'apple': 150, 'banana': 200}\nupdated_records = update_sales(sales_records, 'apple', 10)\nprint(updated_records)\",\n\nIf the value of 'apple' in the 'sales_records' dictionary changes, will the 'updated_records' reflect this change, assuming no other code modifications?",
  "Explanation": "The 'update_sales' function modifies the sales value of a specified product in the records directly. Because Python dictionaries are mutable, changing the value of 'apple' in 'sales_records' directly affects the same object which 'updated_records' also points to.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
