  "Explanation": "Traffic being 'moderate' only occurs under the condition where it is sunny and it is a holiday, as per the logic in the `analyze_traffic_data` function. Since both sunny weather and the holiday are needed for moderate traffic, finding moderate traffic suggests a sunny day combined with a holiday.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
