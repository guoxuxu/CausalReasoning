  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'total_sales' could result from various factors such as lower base prices, lower demand, or absence of a holiday; thus, a decrease alone does not justify that 'is_holiday' was specifically set to False.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
