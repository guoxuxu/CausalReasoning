  "Explanation": "Increasing marketingA adds directly to the salesA (5 units per marketingA point), potentially compensating for reductions due to a high priceA. Since the decrement from a high price primarily affects the additional decrement factor in salesA if exceeding 50, effective marketing can counterbalance or exceed this negative effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
