  "Explanation": "Forcing 'heater_on' to be true directly manipulates the condition within 'update_temperature' causing the temperature to always increase by 5 degrees. This is the direct effect of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
