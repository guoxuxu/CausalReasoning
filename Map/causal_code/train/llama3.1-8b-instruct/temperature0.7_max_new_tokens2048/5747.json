  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag): \n    if flag: \n        result = data * 2 \n    else: \n        result = data + 100 \n    return result \n\ndef final_result(data_point, action_flag): \n    intermediate = process_data(data_point, action_flag) \n    if intermediate > 150: \n        output = 'High' \n    else: \n        output = 'Low' \n    return output\",\n\nIf the variable 'action_flag' is set to True, will the 'result' potentially be greater than 200 for 'data_point' values greater than 100?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'action_flag' to True causes 'process_data' to execute 'result = data * 2'. For 'data_point' values greater than 100, the result will be greater than 200 when doubled, invoking 'result = data * 2'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
