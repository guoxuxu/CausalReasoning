  "Explanation": "Based on the code, if the temperature is above 100, 'temp_status' is set to 'high'. If both 'temp_status' is 'high' and 'humidity' is above 50, then 'risk' is set to 'high'. Therefore, a high temperature can potentially lead to a high risk status, contingent on the level of humidity.",
