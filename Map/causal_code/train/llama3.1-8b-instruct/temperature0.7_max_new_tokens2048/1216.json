  "Problem": "Python code provided above\",\n\nIf the pollution level was lower initially, would the wildlife population be higher before any policies are enacted?",
  "Explanation": "The wildlife population is negatively affected by the pollution level directly due to the initial equation '1000 - pollution'. Additionally, no positive effects from policies are considered since they are enacted after the initialization. Therefore, a lower initial pollution level would have resulted in a higher initial wildlife population.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
