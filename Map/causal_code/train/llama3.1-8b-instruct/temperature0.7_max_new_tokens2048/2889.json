  "Explanation": "If checkIfTrafficIsAllowed() returns true, it indicates that isGreen is true. However, it is not certain that this was due to calling operateTrafficLight with true since isGreen could have been set by calling setTrafficLightGreen() directly or through other manipulations. Initial presumption of isGreen being false doesn’t sufficiently confirm the operation through operateTrafficLight with true, without more context or logs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
