  "Problem": "class ProductSales {\n  int price;\n  int unitsSold;\n  int marketingBudget;\n  ProductSales(this.price, this.unitsSold, this.marketingBudget);\n  int calculateRevenue() {\n    return price * unitsSold;\n  }\n  int allocateMarketingBudget(int additionalBudget) {\n    marketingBudget += additionalBudget;\n    if (marketingBudget > 1000) {\n      unitsSold += 50;\n    } else {\n      unitsSold += 20;\n    }\n    return unitsSold;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in units sold, can we deduce that the marketing budget was increased if we manually corrected the price's influence?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming that the price effect (either increase or decrease) has been accounted for and isolated, an increase in units sold under these conditions would likely result from an increase in the marketing budget, as per the allocateMarketingBudget function logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
