  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, volume, discount, holiday):\n                      base_price = price * (1 - discount)\n                      if holiday:\n                          extra_fee = 10\n                          sales = (base_price + extra_fee) * volume\n                      else:\n                          sales = base_price * volume\n                      return sales\",\n\nIf we set the 'discount' to zero and keep other variables constant, will this always result in increased 'sales'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'discount' to zero leads to '1 - discount' becoming 1, and thus 'base_price' becomes equal to 'price'. This is typically higher than the 'base_price' when 'discount' is greater than zero. Hence, multiplied by the constant 'volume', this results in increased 'sales'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
