  "Problem": "See above Python code example\",\n\nIf the weather condition changes to 'clear', does it imply there was an intervention to reduce pollution below 31?",
  "Explanation": "A 'clear' weather condition is only possible when pollution is below 31. Given that the initial pollution was 50, and without intervention, it would not naturally decrease, an intervention reducing pollution is necessary to achieve this.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
