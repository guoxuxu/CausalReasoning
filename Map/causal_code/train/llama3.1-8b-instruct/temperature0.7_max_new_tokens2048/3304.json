  "Explanation": "Intervening to keep the AC on at any temperature scenario leads to cold drinks being served when guests are present, as the specific condition in the code that serves cold drinks relies primarily on guests being present and AC being on.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
