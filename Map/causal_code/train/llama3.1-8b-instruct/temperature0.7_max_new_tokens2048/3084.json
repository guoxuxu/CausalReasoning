  "Problem": "def process_data(input_list):\n    modified_list = [x * 2 for x in input_list]\n    final_sum = sum(modified_list)\n    if final_sum > 100:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    return result\n\ndata = [10, 20, 30]\noutput = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf we modify the `process_data` function to multiply each element by 3 instead of 2, can it change the likelihood of `result` being True?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the multiplication factor changes the scale of `modified_list`, likely increasing `final_sum` and thus increasing the chance of `result` being True, especially for input values that were close to causing `final_sum` to exceed 100 with the original factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
