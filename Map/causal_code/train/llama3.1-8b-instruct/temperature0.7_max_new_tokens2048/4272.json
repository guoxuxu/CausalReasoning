  "Problem": "def update_inventory(stock, transaction): \n    if transaction['type'] == 'purchase': \n        stock[transaction['item']] -= transaction['quantity'] \n    elif transaction['type'] == 'restock': \n        stock[transaction['item']] += transaction['quantity'] \n    return stock\",\n\nIf we override the transaction type to 'restock', and a transaction is processed, will this cause the stock quantity of that item to increase?",
  "Explanation": "By forcing the transaction type to 'restock' and processing a transaction, the stock of the item increases by the amount specified in the transaction quantity according to the code. This is a direct intervention meant to increase the stock.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
