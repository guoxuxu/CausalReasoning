  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    for index, value in enumerate(data): \n        if value % 2 == 0: \n            data[index] *= 10 \n        else: \n            data[index] += 5 \n    return data\",\n\nIf the output list contains numbers that are all multiples of 10, does it mean all elements in the input list were even?",
  "Explanation": "The only transformation that multiplies by 10 occurs if the elements are initially even. If all output numbers are multiples of 10, this means all input numbers were even, as odd numbers would have a different operation applied (addition of 5).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "evenness → value % 2 == 0 → multiplication by 10; oddness → value % 2!= 0 → addition of 5"
