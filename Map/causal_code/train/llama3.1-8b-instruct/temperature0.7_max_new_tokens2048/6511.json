Does this remain true if the character is poisoned?",
  "Explanation": "When poisoned, the damage is doubled, meaning that taking 10 damage would decrease health by 20 when poisoned, not by 10.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
