  "Problem": "See above ClimateControlSystem class and its usage\",\n\nCan observing the current indoor temperature reveal the exact external temperature without additional data?",
  "Explanation": "The current indoor temperature is influenced by both the external temperature and the air conditioning's effectiveness, along with the desired temperature. Without knowing the effectiveness of the AC or the desired temperature, the exact external temperature cannot be discerned solely from the current indoor temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Observing the current indoor temperature does not directly reveal the exact external temperature without additional data, but it can be used in conjunction with the climate to infer the external temperature."
