  "Problem": "def calculate_scores(data):\n    s1 = 5 * data['A'] + 3 * data['B'] - data['C']\n    if data['D'] > 0:\n        s2 = s1 * 2\n    else:\n        s2 = s1 - 10\n    return s2\",\n\nIf we set 'A', 'B', and 'C' to zero and 'D' is positive, will 's2' be zero?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'A', 'B', and 'C' to zero results in 's1' being 0 (s1 = 0). However, given 'D' is positive, 's2' becomes 0 * 2 = 0, so no change occurs here and remains zero. Initially, my description missed the outcome, the answer is actually yes for the question posed.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
