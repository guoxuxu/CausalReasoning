  "Explanation": "Applying 'SAVE10' provides a discount of 10, which is subtracted from the product of ‘base_price’ and ‘quantity’. This decreased taxable amount subsequently lowers both the tax and the final 'total' compared to a scenario where no discount is applied. Since the intervention explicitly reduces the 'taxable_amount', it also reduces the 'total'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
