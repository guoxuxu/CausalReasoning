  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(price, advertising, day_of_week):\n    if day_of_week == 'Sunday':\n        sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.2) * 1.5\n    else:\n        sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.1)\n    return sales\",\n\nBy observing an increase in sales, can we infer that a previous intervention was made to always set the day to Sunday?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in sales can result from multiple changes such as a rise in the advertising budget or lowering the price, not just from setting the day to Sunday. Hence, intervening to make every day Sunday isn't a necessary conclusion from noticing higher sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
