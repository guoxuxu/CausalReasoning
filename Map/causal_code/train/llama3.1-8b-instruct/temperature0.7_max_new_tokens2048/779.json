  "Explanation": "According to the source code, a 0.1 discount rate is only applied when the amount exceeds 1000. If the discount rate is observed to be 0.1, one can conclude that the amount was indeed over 1000, unless there is an external alteration to the code logic or a manual override. This is a reversal from effect (discount rate known) to cause (inferring amount) with an intervention being the awareness of no external alterations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
