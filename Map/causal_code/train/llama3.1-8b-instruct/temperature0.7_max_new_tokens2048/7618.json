  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, customer_age, is_first_time_customer): \n    if customer_age > 60 or is_first_time_customer: \n        discount = 0.10 \n    else: \n        discount = 0.05 \n    final_price = price * (1 - discount) \n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final price is high, can we infer that the price of the item was high?",
  "Explanation": "A high final price can result from a high initial price but can also be moderately high despite a lower initial price if the discount is smaller (applies to customers aged 60 or below, not first-time customers). Therefore, a high final price does not necessarily imply that the original price was high.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
