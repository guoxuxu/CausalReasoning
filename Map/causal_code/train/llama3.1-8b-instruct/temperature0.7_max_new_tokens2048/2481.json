  "Explanation": "The logic in 'train_model' function ties the number of samples directly with the model's accuracy: more than 50 samples contribute to an accuracy of 0.95. Since deploying requires an accuracy greater than 0.9, increasing the dataset size to more than 50 would naturally influence the decision to deploy.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
