  "Explanation": "A decrease in healthScore can occur either from being a smoker or from being older than 50, as both conditions independently reduce the healthScore. Therefore, a decrease in healthScore alone does not necessarily mean the person has started smoking.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
