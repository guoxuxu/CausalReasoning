  "Explanation": "While having a customer_age above 30 and a high interest level can lead to 'good' sales performance, the observed 'good' performance alone does not conclusively indicate that the customer_age is above 30 because other unaccounted factors or configurations might also lead to 'good' performance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
