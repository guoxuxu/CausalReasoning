  "Explanation": "Reducing the initial fuel level decreases the car's ability to drive longer distances, as the fuel decrements with each drive operation. With less fuel, the car will require refueling sooner, hence reducing the number of times it can drive before needing more fuel.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A lower initial fuel level causes a lower fuel level, which in turn causes a lower number of drives, resulting in a later refueling."
