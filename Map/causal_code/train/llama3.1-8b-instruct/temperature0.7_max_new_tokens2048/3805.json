  "Explanation": "A decrease in the final payment might occur due to an increase in the discount rate, but it could also be caused by a reduction in item prices or quantities. Without further details, a direct implication on the discount rate increase cannot be asserted.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
