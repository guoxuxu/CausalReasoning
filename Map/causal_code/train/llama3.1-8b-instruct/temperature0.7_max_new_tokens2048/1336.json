  "Explanation": "A false return from `isCold()` indicates the current temperature is 15 degrees or more. However, this does not necessarily imply the initial temperature was 15 degrees or more since the temperature can be increased by the `increaseTemperature()` method after the initial setting.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
