  "Explanation": "If 'use_filter' is set to False, all data points, irrespective of their value relative to 'filter_value', are included in 'filtered_data'. This can lower the average (sum) if lower-valued points that would have been excluded by the filter are included, thereby affecting 'result'. Thus, observing a lower 'result' could suggest that maybe 'use_filter' should have been True to exclude these values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
