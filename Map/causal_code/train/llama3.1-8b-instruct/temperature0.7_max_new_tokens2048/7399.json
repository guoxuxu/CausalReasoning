  "Problem": "class WeatherSystem { double temperature; boolean rain; void updateWeather(double temp_change, boolean new_rain_condition) { temperature += temp_change; if (temperature < 60) { rain = true; } else if (temperature > 80) { rain = false; } rain = new_rain_condition; } }\",\n\nIf we forcibly set new_rain_condition to false, will rain definitely not occur even if temperature is adjusted below 60 in the update?",
  "Explanation": "Forcibly setting new_rain_condition to false will ensure that rain is false at the end of the updateWeather method, even if the temperature adjustments cause the temperature to drop below 60, which under normal circumstances would set rain to true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
