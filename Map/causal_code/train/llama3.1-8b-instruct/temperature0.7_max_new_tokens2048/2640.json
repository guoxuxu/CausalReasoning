  "Explanation": "Manually changing the category to 'Adult' does not affect the 'income' check in the code, which independently sets the 'status' based on whether the income is higher than 50000. Hence, changing the category does not influence the income-related condition and thus does not guarantee a 'High-income' status.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
