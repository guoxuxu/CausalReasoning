  "Problem": "class ShopCart {\n    static int itemCount = 0;\n    double totalCost = 0.0;\n\n    void addItem(double price) {\n        itemCount++;\n        totalCost += price;\n    }\n\n    void applyDiscount(double percentage) {\n        totalCost -= totalCost * percentage / 100;\n    }\n\n    static void resetCart() {\n        itemCount = 0;\n    }\n\n    static int getItemCount() {\n        return itemCount;\n    }\n\n    double getTotalCost() {\n        return totalCost;\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf an itemCount of 0 is observed, can we infer that the resetCart method was called?",
  "Explanation": "Although resetting the cart sets the itemCount to 0, itemCount starts from 0 initially when the ShopCart object is created. Therefore, observing an itemCount of 0 doesn’t necessarily mean that resetCart was called; the itemCount could simply be 0 from initialization or no item has been added.",
