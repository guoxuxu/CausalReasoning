  "Explanation": "The transition to 'Manageable' could either be due to the umbrella just being opened in response to rain or it already being open before the rain was toggled. Hence, we cannot conclusively say the umbrella was already open based on the output change alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
