  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data['value'] + 2\n    y = x * 3\n    if y > 20:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    z = y - 5\n    return {'result': result, 'z': z}\",\n\nIf the input value is increased, will the output 'result' likely be True?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the input value directly increases 'x'. Since 'y' is calculated as 'x' multiplied by 3, an increase in 'x' also increases 'y'. The condition checks if 'y' is greater than 20 to return True; hence, increasing the input increases the chances of this condition being met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
