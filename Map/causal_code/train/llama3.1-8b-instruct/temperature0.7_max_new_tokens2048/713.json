  "Explanation": "The 'Return processed' message does not depend on initial inventory levels; it merely confirms that a return was added to the current inventory. It's independent of the initial quantity, as returns add to whatever current level is.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
