  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data.get('x', 0)\n    y = x * 2\n    data['y'] = y\n    z = y + 10\n    data['z'] = z\n    return data\",\n\nIf the value of 'x' in the input data is increased, will the value of 'z' in the output also increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'z' is calculated as 'y + 10', where 'y' is derived from 'x * 2'. Thus, any increase in 'x' directly doubles in 'y' and subsequently increases 'z' by the same factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
