  "Explanation": "Poor air quality could also be due to initial high pollution levels or contributions from other sources not defined in the code. Thus, a larger factory size is not the only possible cause of poor air quality.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
