  "Explanation": "This scenario tests the inference from effect (system suggests closing the window) to cause (weather being rainy) without intervention. The suggestion to close the window comes only if the weather is rainy AND the window is open. However, without information on the window's state (whether it is actually open or not), it cannot be definitively concluded that the weather must be rainy; the window might be closed independently of the weather's condition.",
