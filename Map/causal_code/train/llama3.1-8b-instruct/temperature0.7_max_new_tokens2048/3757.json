  "Explanation": "Decreasing stress levels could be caused by any combination of increased exercise, better dietary habits, or beginning to take supplements, or even changes in factors not captured by these variables. Without intervention or additional data, we cannot accurately infer specific changes in these habits just from observing a decrease in stress level.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
