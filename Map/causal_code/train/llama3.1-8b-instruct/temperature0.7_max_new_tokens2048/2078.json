  "Explanation": "Setting 'IsLoyaltyMember' to True for all records will likely increase the number of instances where discounts are applied (for totals over 1000), thus altering 'DiscountedTotal'. This tests the intervention from a cause (loyalty status) to an effect (total with potential discount).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
