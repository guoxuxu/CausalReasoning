  "Explanation": "The function only returns 'success' when the substring 'error' is not found in the cleaned input data. Since the data cleaning process involves stripping and lowering the case, absence of 'error' post-process implies its absence pre-process assuming proper function operation.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
