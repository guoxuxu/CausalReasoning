  "Explanation": "An increase in the banana inventory without an inventory adjustment elsewhere in the system likely implies that the restock method was called, as this method directly increases the inventory of the specified item.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
