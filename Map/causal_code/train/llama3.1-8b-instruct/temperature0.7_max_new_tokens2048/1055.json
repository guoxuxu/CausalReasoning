  "Explanation": "Changing the information in the database directly about the user activity (like manually editing it to 'logout') does not affect the user's status. The user status is determined only through executing the function with appropriate action parameters, not by manually intervening in the log contents.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
