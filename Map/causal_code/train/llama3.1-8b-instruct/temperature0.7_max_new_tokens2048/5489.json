  "Explanation": "When bonus is set to 0 (intervention), and high_score_bonus_enabled is True, an additional 20 points will be added to a base_score of 95 (adjusted for no other bonuses or penalties), leading the calculation to a final score of 115 before the cap at 100 is applied. This means the final_score is definitely greater than 95.",
