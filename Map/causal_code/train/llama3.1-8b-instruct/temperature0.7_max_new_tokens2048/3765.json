  "Explanation": "Considering the 'update_weather' logic, rainfall is prevented by temperatures below zero regardless of humidity. Thus, if 'is_raining' is manually set to False and it remains not raining despite high humidity, it suggests the temperature may indeed be below zero, as this condition overrides the humidity check.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
