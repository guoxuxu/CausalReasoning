  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_value, adjust_factor):\n    filtered_data = [x for x in data if x > filter_value]\n    adjusted_data = [x * adjust_factor for x in filtered_data]\n    return sum(adjusted_data)\n\n# Example Usage:\ndata = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\nfilter_value = 25\nadjust_factor = 2\nresult = process_data(data, filter_value, adjust_factor)\",\n\nIf we manually double the adjust_factor, will this double the final result?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the adjust_factor doubles each element's contribution to the final sum after filtering, effectively doubling the overall result provided that some elements meet the filtering condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
