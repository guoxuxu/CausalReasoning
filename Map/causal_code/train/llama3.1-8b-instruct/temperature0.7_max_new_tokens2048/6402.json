  "Problem": "[\n    \"def calculate_discount(items, coupon):\",\n    \"    discount = 0\",\n    \"    if coupon == 'SAVE10':\",\n    \"        discount = 0.1\",\n    \"    total_price = sum(item['price'] for item in items)\",\n    \"    if total_price > 100:\",\n    \"        discount += 0.05\",\n    \"    return total_price * (1 - discount)\"\n  ],\n\nDoes a reduction in final price prove that a 'SAVE10' coupon was applied?",
  "Explanation": "The final price can be reduced either by coupon usage or by the total price exceeding $100, which grants an additional discount. Thus, a reduced final price does not unequivocally verify the application of a 'SAVE10' coupon.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
