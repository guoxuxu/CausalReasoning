  "Explanation": "In the code, the 'profitable' flag is only set to True when 'profit' (which is 'sales' minus 'expenses') is greater than 50000. Thus, if 'profitable' is True, it necessarily means 'sales' were higher than 'expenses'. However, this doesn't specify by how much they must be higher, only that profit must be exceeding 50000.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
