  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(price, advertising, day_of_week):\n    if day_of_week == 'Sunday':\n        sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.2) * 1.5\n    else:\n        sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.1)\n    return sales\",\n\nIf you could control the day of the week to always be Sunday, how would this impact sales if we increase the advertising budget?",
  "Explanation": "Fixing the day of the week to Sunday amplifies the impact of the advertising budget in the sales equation by using a higher multiplier (1.5 total impact due to 1.2 advertising impact on sales), thus sales will increase more significantly compared to other days.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
