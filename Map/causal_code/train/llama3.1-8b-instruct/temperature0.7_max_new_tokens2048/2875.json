  "Explanation": "An increase in 'discounted_total' can also result from a lower 'discount_rate' or higher initial 'sales_total' values. 'holiday' being True is not the sole factor that could lead to an increase, making it not sufficient to deduce the effect from the cause without considering other variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
