  "Explanation": "Even if the `heater_override` is set to False, the temperature might decrease due to other factors such as a significant drop in `external_temp`. The absence of an increase in `temperature` cannot conclusively indicate that `heater_override` was set to True or False without knowing the accompanying change in `external_temp`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
