  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'temperature' in data:\n        temp_adjust = data['temperature'] * 1.8 + 32\n    else:\n        temp_adjust = 0\n    result = temp_adjust + 10\n    if data.get('pressure', 100) > 120:\n        result += 5\n    return result\",\n\nIf you set the 'pressure' key to a value above 120 in the input data, will this always increase the 'result' by 5 compared to when the 'pressure' is less than 120?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the 'pressure' key above 120 directly causes an addition of 5 to the 'result' as per the conditional check `if data.get('pressure', 100) > 120`. This intervention ensures that changing the pressure value manipulatively affects the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
