  "Problem": "def update_scores(scores, action, delta):\n    if action == 'add':\n        for i in range(len(scores)):\n            scores[i] += delta\n    elif action == 'multiply':\n        for i in range(len(scores)):\n            scores[i] *= delta\n    return scores\n\nscores_list = [10, 20, 30]\nupdate_scores(scores_list, 'add', 5)\nupdate_scores(scores_list, 'multiply', 2)\",\n\nIf the final values of `scores_list` are observed to be higher, can it be inferred that the initial values must have been higher without knowing the specific actions taken?",
  "Explanation": "The final values being higher is not solely dependent on the initial values being higher because the actions ('add' or 'multiply') and the values of `delta` directly affect the scores. Without knowing the actions or delta changes, one cannot infer that higher final scores necessarily result from higher initial scores.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
