  "Explanation": "The decide_activity function returns 'Stay indoors' only when the forecast method of the weather instance returns 'Rainy'. Therefore, if the decision is to stay indoors, it implies a rainy forecast.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
