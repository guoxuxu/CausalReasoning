  "Explanation": "Changing the weather status to 'sunny' directly relates to the temperature being over 20 degrees as per the '__init__' initialization logic and isn't directly linked to the humidity levels. Therefore, we cannot infer that an intervention making it 'sunny' also ensured that the humidity was below 80.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
