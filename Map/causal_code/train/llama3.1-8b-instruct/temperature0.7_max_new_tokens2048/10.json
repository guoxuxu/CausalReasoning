  "Explanation": "A larger consecutive order might not be fulfilled, but this does not necessarily imply the initial inventory was low, but rather that the enough inventory was depleted by previous orders. The inventory state at the time of each purchase order depends on all previous transactions and the initial amount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
