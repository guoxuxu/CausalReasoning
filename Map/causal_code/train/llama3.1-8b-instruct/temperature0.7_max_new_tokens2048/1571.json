  "Problem": "class WeatherTracker { var weatherType: String = 'sunny' func updateWeather(t: String) { weatherType = t } func shouldTakeUmbrella() -> Bool { return weatherType == 'rainy' } }\",\n\nIf the weatherType was initially 'sunny' and later the updateWeather method was called with 'rainy', will shouldTakeUmbrella return true?",
  "Explanation": "The updateWeather function sets the weatherType to its argument. Setting it to 'rainy' causes shouldTakeUmbrella to check this new state, returning true because it directly checks if weatherType is 'rainy'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
