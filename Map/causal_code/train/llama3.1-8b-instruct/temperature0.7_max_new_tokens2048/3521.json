  "Explanation": "Optionally setting the 'discount_code' to 'SUMMER20' doesn't necessarily imply the customer had a coupon, as code assignments can be manually manipulated or affected by external logic not reflected in the observable 'has_coupon' value. Hence, we cannot reliably backtrack from the discount application to the possession of a real coupon.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
