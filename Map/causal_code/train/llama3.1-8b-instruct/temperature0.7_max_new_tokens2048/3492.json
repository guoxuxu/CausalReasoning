  "Explanation": "Setting `income` to 40000 is an intervention that directly changes the income condition tested in the code (`income > 30000`). As 40000 is greater than 30000, according to the code logic, the `tax_bracket` is set to 'high'. This question involves directly modifying the cause (income) to see its effect on the tax_bracket.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
