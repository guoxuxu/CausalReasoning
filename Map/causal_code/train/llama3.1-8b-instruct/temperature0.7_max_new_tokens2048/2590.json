  "Explanation": "Not necessarily; the removal of the need for cooling could be due solely to the reduction in CPU usage since both high CPU use or high temperature can individually trigger the cooling requirement.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
