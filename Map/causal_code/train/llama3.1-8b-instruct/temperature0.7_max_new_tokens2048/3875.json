  "Explanation": "In the generate_data function, a mood of 'sad' is exclusively a result of the weather being 'rainy'. There are no other pathways in the code where mood can be 'sad' except when the weather is 'rainy'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
