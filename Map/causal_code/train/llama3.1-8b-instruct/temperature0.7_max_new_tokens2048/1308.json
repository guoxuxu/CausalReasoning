  "Explanation": "Since the presence of 'processed' as True only occurs if 'status' is 'success', which in turn is only true if 'error' is not in the data, we can deduce the absence of 'error' when 'processed' is True. This backward inference is based solely on output to input reasoning.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
