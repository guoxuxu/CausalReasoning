  "Explanation": "Reducing the pollution level impacts the condition set for disease occurrence in elderly individuals (over the age of 50). If the intervention lowers the pollution below 75, it can prevent the disease in someone over 50.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
