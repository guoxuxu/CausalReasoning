  "Explanation": "A decrease in the output value could be due to either having fewer large numbers resulting in smaller `modified_data` values post-multiplication, or to some other factor affecting the `result`(such as all values being at the lower end above 10). Merely having more elements ≤ 10 won't directly influence the output unless it impacts the quantities of elements >10.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the output decreases, it would likely be because the elements in data decreased, which in turn would be because there were more elements less than or equal to 10."
