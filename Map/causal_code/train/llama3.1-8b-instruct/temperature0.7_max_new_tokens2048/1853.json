  "Problem": "Described above in text section.\",\n\nDoes increasing the temperature always lead to the choice of 'swimming' as an activity?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the temperature causes the environment to become 'hot', but 'swimming' is only chosen if the mood is also 'happy'. Therefore, while temperature affects the hotness of the environment, the final activity decision also depends on the mood.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
