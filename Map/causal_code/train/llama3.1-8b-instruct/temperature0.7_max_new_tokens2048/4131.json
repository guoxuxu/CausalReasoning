  "Explanation": "The increase in rainfall is triggered by high temperatures not by calling decrease_rainfall. decrease_rainfall method, in fact, reduces the rainfall as its primary function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
