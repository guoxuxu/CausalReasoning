  "Problem": "def compute_impact(sales, marketing_budget, economy_index):\n    if economy_index > 50:\n        sales += sales * 0.1\n    else:\n        sales += sales * 0.05\n    if marketing_budget > 1000:\n        sales += sales * 0.2\n    return sales\",\n\nIf we observe a 20% increase in sales, can we conclude this was due to an intervention in marketing budget set specifically at 1200?",
  "Explanation": "While a 20% increase might occur when the marketing budget exceeds 1000, this specific increase might also be the result of combined factors such as an economy index greater than 50. Additionally, a marketing budget over 1000 doesn’t imply it was exactly 1200.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
