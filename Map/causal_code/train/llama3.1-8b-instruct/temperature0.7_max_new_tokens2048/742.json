  "Explanation": "Increasing the tax_rate would increase the calculated final_price. Adjusting the discount trigger to a higher threshold would mean that this higher calculated final_price is less likely to receive a discount, thus remaining higher than if the discount were applied under the original conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
