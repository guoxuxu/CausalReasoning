  "Explanation": "We cannot infer the prior smoking status based on the false return of heartDisease() post intervention, especially when the cholesterol is reduced below 200, an alternative pathway (age over 50 and cholesterol over 200, or diabetes with cholesterol over 250) could still lead to heartDisease() returning true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
