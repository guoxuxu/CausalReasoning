  "Explanation": "In the Environment class, the 'change_weather' method directly checks the pollution level and changes the weather to 'cloudy' if it is above 50. There is a direct causal relationship from pollution level to weather condition without any intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
