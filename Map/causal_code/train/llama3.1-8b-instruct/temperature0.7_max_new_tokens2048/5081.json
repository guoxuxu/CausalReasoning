  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 26 leads to 'high' humidity, which turns the sprinklers on. Although this increases the likelihood that vents are open, vents could also be 'partially open' if sprinklers are on but temperature isn’t sufficiently high enough based on other conditions in adjust_vents function.",
