  "Explanation": "Updating the stock price via the 'update_stock_price' method changes the 'stock_price' field. Since the 'total_income' from selling stocks is calculated as stock_price multiplied by the amount of stocks sold, an intervention in the stock price directly affects the income realized from sales.",
