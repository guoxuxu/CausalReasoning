  "Explanation": "The method 'get_recent_purchase' exclusively returns the last tuple from 'purchase_history', which collects data only from 'purchase_item' transactions. Directly modifying 'stock' doesn't update 'purchase_history', so it doesn't influence what 'get_recent_purchase' returns.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
