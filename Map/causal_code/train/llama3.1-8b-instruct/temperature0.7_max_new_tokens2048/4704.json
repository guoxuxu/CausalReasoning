  "Problem": "def update_health(player, delta, effect):\n    player['health'] += delta\n    if effect == 'poison':\n        player['status'] = 'poisoned'\n    elif effect == 'heal':\n        player['status'] = 'healthy'\n\nplayer_info = {'name': 'John', 'health': 100, 'status': 'normal'}\nupdate_health(player_info, -20, 'poison')\",\n\nCan we conclude that the player's status was 'poisoned' because the player's health decreased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in player's health does not necessarily imply the player's status was 'poisoned'. The status 'poisoned' is specifically caused by the effect 'poison'. The health decrease could be due to other reasons in different scenarios, without the status necessarily being 'poisoned'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
