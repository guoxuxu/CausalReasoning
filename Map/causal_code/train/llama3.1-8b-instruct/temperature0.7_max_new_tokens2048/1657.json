  "Explanation": "Although the rule caps the bonus at $10,000, the increase in the performance rating from 7 to 10 increases the bonus percentage from 10% to 20%. If the salary and initial bonus were such that the initial bonus was below $10,000, the increase in rating would still enhance the bonus until the cap is reached.",
