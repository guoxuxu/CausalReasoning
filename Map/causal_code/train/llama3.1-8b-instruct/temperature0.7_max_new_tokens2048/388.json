  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { constructor() { this.weather = 'sunny'; this.temperature = 25; } updateWeather(weather) { this.weather = weather; if (weather === 'rainy') { this.temperature -= 5; } else if (weather === 'sunny') { this.temperature += 5; } } } const simulator = new WeatherSimulator(); simulator.updateWeather('rainy');\",\n\nIf the temperature is observed at 30 degrees following an intervention, can we infer the weather was set to 'sunny'?",
  "Explanation": "Given the code structure and assuming no other manipulations apart from those in the code or other weather conditions, a resultant temperature of 30 degrees, after setting any direct intervention, suggests that the weather was indeed updated to 'sunny'. This is the only scenario in the code where the temperature increases and can reach 30 if starting from the base value (set during an earlier intervention or initial condition).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
