  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand_factor, discount_applied):\n    base_price = price\n    if discount_applied:\n        price = price * 0.9  # 10% discount\n    demand = demand_factor * price\n    sales = price * demand\n    return sales\",\n\nAssuming 'sales' have decreased, can implementing a discount reverse this trend?",
  "Explanation": "While applying a discount might increase 'demand' by making the price more attractive, it doesn't guarantee an increase in 'sales' as it also lowers the 'price' component. Thus, simply applying a discount may not suffice to reverse a decrease in 'sales' without considering other factors at play such as the 'demand_factor' and underlying 'price'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
