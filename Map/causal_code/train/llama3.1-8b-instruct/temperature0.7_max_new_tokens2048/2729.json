  "Explanation": "Traffic lights being off does not necessarily mean there was an intervention to remove them. According to the class logic, traffic lights will naturally turn off if the car count decreases to 10 or fewer, without requiring manual intervention. Hence, lights being off could also be a natural effect of decreased traffic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
