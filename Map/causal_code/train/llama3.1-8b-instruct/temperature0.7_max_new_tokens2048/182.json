  "Explanation": "The 'current_status' function returns a broad category based on the health_score and does not provide detailed information about the initial specific states (healthy or unhealthy diet, exercise true or false). It solely indicates a health range, and similar health scores could result from different combinations of diet and exercise.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
