  "Explanation": "Price increases could be due to low stock or high demand. Therefore, an increase by 15 could be from setting stock below 10, or it could be an accumulation of effects from both demand increase and low stock.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
