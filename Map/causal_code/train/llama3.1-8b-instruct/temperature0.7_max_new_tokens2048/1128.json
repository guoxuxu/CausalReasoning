  "Explanation": "Applying more sophisticated data cleaning techniques would presumably remove more erroneous or outlier values, leading to a dataset that better represents the underlying distribution. This cleaner dataset, when passed through the 'analyze' function, would produce a more accurate average, establishing a causal pathway from the cleaning process to the accuracy of the results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
