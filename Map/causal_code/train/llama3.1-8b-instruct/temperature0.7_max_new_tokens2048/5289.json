  "Problem": "[Described above]\",\n\nIf the platform starts restricting high-rated content only to subscribers, will this affect the average content ratings?",
  "Explanation": "Such an intervention would likely increase the average ratings of high-rated content since only subscribers, who tend to give higher ratings, would watch them.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Subscribers → Content restrictions; Content restrictions → Reduced content availability; Reduced content availability → Lower average content ratings; Platform's action → Subscribers; Subscribers → Platform's revenue; Platform's revenue → Platform's decision; Platform's decision → Content restrictions",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Restricting high-rated content to subscribers will lead to lower average content ratings due to reduced content availability."
