  "Explanation": "According to the code, increasing the hydration level to above 50 makes the condition isExercising = true possible when startExercise() is called. Thus, raising the hydration level to 70 directly influences the ability to exercise when startExercise() method is executed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
