  "Problem": "def compute_sales_data(prices, discounts, tax_rate):\n    final_prices = [(p - p * d) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)]\n    tax_amounts = [fp * tax_rate for fp in final_prices]\n    total_sales = sum([fp + ta for fp, ta in zip(final_prices, tax_amounts)])\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf the discount rates are reduced, will the total sales likely increase without other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "Reducing discount rates means that the final prices after discount for each item will be higher, assuming no changes in tax rate or customer behavior. This potentially makes items more expensive, which could lead to lower sales volume and thus lower total sales, unless this is offset by increased demand or number of items sold.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
