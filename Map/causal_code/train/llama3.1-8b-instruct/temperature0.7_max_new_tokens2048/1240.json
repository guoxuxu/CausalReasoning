  "Explanation": "Calling 'increase_temperature' method increases the 'temperature' attribute in the WeatherStation class. Consequently, when 'report_temperature' is called afterwards, it returns a string indicating a higher temperature, reflecting the increased value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
