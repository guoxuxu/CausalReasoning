  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_threshold):\n    filtered_data = [d for d in data if d > filter_threshold]\n    added_value = sum(filtered_data) + 10\n    return added_value\n\nresult = process_data([3, 15, 7, 22, 5], 10)\",\n\nIf the result from the process_data function is 0, can we conclude that the filter_threshold was set unusually high?",
  "Explanation": "A result of 0 indicates that the sum of filtered_data plus 10 is zero. Since this added value results from adding 10 to the sum of filtered_data, the only way this sum would end up being negative (and ultimately zero when 10 is added) is if filtered_data is empty. Thus, it is highly likely that filter_threshold was set above all data points.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
