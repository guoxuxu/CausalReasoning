  "Problem": "\n  sales = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]\n  cost_of_goods_sold = [50, 100, 150, 200, 250]\n  operating_expense = [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]\n  additional_investment = [10, 10, 20, 30, 40]\n\n  profit = []\n  for i in range(5):\n      gross_profit = sales[i] - cost_of_goods_sold[i]\n      net_profit = gross_profit - operating_expense[i]\n      net_profit += additional_investment[i]\n      profit.append(net_profit)\n  \"\"\",\n\nIf profit increases, can we infer that sales have definitely increased, without any other information?",
  "Explanation": "Profit can increase due to several factors: an increase in sales, a decrease in cost of goods sold or operating expenses, or an increase in additional investments. Without specific information about the other variables, an increase in profit does not definitively imply an increase in sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
