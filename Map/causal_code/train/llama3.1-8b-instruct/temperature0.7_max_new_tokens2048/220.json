  "Explanation": "Changing the 'status' manually to 'minor' suggests that 'is_adult' should logically align with this new status for consistency. Although 'is_adult' is initially derived from 'age', this manual change in 'status' implies that 'is_adult' would have been correspondingly set to False to reflect the new 'status'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
