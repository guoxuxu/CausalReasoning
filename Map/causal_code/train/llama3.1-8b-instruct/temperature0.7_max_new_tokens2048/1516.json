  "Explanation": "While it’s true that having diabetes sets the risk level at 'Medium' for people under 50 or over 50 with moderate conditions, a risk level of 'Medium' is not exclusively caused by having diabetes as younger people without other conditions might not fall into any higher risk even with diabetes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
