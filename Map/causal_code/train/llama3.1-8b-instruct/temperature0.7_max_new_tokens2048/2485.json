  "Explanation": "Setting `is_holiday` to False and invoking `process_orders` results in all orders being processed and the orders list being cleared, as the method checks that it's not a holiday before processing and clearing orders.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
