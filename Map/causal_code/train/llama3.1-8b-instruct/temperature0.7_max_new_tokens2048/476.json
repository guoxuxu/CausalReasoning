  "Explanation": "Observing an increased `temperature` might suggest that `heaterOn` being set to true had a corresponding effect, but since the system's internal logic in `adjustTemperature` does not automatically update `temperature` based solely on heater status, an assumption that the external method mimics the internal method's logical flow is incorrect. It's likely due to other factors or additional code not shown.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
