  "Explanation": "The code does not include any mechanism to stop exercising once it has begun, regardless of changes in hydration level. Therefore, if the individual has started exercising (isExercising is true), reducing the hydration level below 50 will not alter the exercising state within this session or the context presented in this code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
