  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag): \n    if flag: \n        result = data * 2 \n    else: \n        result = data + 100 \n    return result \n\ndef final_result(data_point, action_flag): \n    intermediate = process_data(data_point, action_flag) \n    if intermediate > 150: \n        output = 'High' \n    else: \n        output = 'Low' \n    return output\",\n\nIf we observe the 'intermediate' value is less than 150 after manipulating the 'data_point', can we confidently assert 'action_flag' was set to True?",
  "Explanation": "An 'intermediate' value being less than 150 simply indicates that the result after processing through 'process_data' is below 150. This can occur both when 'action_flag' is True or False, depending on the value of 'data_point'. Without knowing the exact value of 'data_point' or the operation applied inside 'process_data', we cannot determine the state of 'action_flag' reliably.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
