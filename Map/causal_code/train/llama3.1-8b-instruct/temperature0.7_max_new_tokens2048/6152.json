  "Explanation": "While the active status being true generally implies that the steps are over 10,000, it's not guaranteed as the active status could potentially be modified by other parts of the system not shown here, or steps could be reset to 0 afterward yet the active status could erroneously remain true due to a bug or a missed reset. This question examines inference from the present effect back to the historical cause without intervention",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
