  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    cleaned_data = clean_data(data)\n    analyzed_data = analyze_data(cleaned_data)\n    return analyzed_data\n\ndef clean_data(data):\n  return [x for x in data if x % 2 == 0]\n\ndef analyze_data(data):\n  result = sum(data) / len(data)\n  return result\",\n\nIf the average calculated in `analyze_data` is observed to increase, can it be concluded that the function `clean_data` was altered to exclude more low values?",
  "Explanation": "Observing an increased average from `analyze_data` could reasonably lead to the conclusion that `clean_data` had been modified to exclude more low-end values, thus raising the overall average of the data passed to `analyze_data`. This assumes that no other factors affecting the data input or other parts of the code have changed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
