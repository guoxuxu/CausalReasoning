  "Explanation": "While turning on the heater does increase the temperature, a higher temperature does not necessarily mean the heater was just turned on. The heater could have been turned off but still retains the high temperature, or the temperature might have been manually set higher without turning the heater on.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
