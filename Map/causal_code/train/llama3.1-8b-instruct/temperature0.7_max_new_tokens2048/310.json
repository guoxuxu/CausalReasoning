  "Explanation": "While increasing temperature can lead to increased humidity, directly setting new humidity through the adjust_humidity method can also raise humidity, independent of temperature adjustments. Therefore, an increase in humidity alone does not necessarily imply a temperature adjustment.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
