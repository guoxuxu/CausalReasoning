  "Problem": "def update_temperature(weather_data, action):\n    temperature = weather_data['temperature']\n    if action == 'increase':\n        temperature += 3\n    elif action == 'decrease':\n        temperature -= 5\n    return temperature\n\n# Example usage\ncurrent_weather = {'temperature': 20}\nnew_temperature = update_temperature(current_weather, 'increase')\",\n\nIf it's observed that the temperature has increased by 3 degrees and you know there are no external temperature influences, can you deduce that the action taken was 'increase'?",
  "Explanation": "Given that external influences are controlled or nullified, observing a 3 degree increase implies that the action must have been 'increase', as this is the only condition under which the function enforces such an exact change in the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
