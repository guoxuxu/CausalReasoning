  "Explanation": "Setting the air quality index to a high value artificially (e.g., overriding the data variable without using the updateFactoryStatus function) does not necessarily reflect the actual operational status of the factory. The air quality can be manipulated independently of the factory's status, hence it's not a reliable method to infer the operational status of the factory.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
