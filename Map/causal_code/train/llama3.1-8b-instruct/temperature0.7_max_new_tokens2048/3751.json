  "Explanation": "The weather status being 'cloudy' can be caused either by the presence of rain or by the temperature being 20 degrees or below. Hence, it is not necessary that it must be raining when the weather is cloudy, as a low temperature alone can also result in a 'cloudy' status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
