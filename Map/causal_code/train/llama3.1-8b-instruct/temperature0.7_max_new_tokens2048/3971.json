  "Explanation": "The function's output is derived from scaled data. Higher return values result from the relative position of the data points around their mean, not just the absolute values of the input data. A high output can be seen with a low raw average if the spread or standard deviation is small.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
