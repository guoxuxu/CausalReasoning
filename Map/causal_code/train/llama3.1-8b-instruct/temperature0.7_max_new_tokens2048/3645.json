  "Problem": "As above\",\n\nSuppose plant's growth rate is lower than expected, does this mean the environment did not have enough sunlight and water?",
  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: a lower growth rate could be due to various factors, like insufficient nutrients in the soil or lower levels of sunlight and water, but cannot exclusively conclude the latter without checking all variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
