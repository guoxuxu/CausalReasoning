  "Problem": "def manage_inventory(item, sales): \n    if item.stock < 10: \n        item.reorder(30) \n    item.stock -= sales \n    if sales > 20: \n        item.create_discount(5) \n    return item.stock\",\n\nIf the warehouse intervenes to adjust the reorder quantity to 50 for items with stock below 5, will this change be reflected in increased stock level the next time manage_inventory runs?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the reorder quantity to 50 instead of 30 when items are below 5 as an intervention will result in a higher stock level increase for such items, assuming manage_inventory function is called after such intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
