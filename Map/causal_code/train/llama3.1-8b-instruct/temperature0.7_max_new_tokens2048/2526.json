  "Explanation": "Given the logic within the resetAlarm method, the alarm can only be reset (or remain false) if the temperature at the time of the call was 100 or less. This is based on the conditional check in the resetAlarm method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
