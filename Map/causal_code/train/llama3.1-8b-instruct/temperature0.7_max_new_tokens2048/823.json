  "Explanation": "Improved predictions can result from multiple factors including changes in any step within \\'process_data\\', changes to the input data, or even modifications in the external environment or model parameters. An enhancement in \\'prepare_model_input\\' is just one possible cause and cannot be confirmed without specific intervention or investigation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
