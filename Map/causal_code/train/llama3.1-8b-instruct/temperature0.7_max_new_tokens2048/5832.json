  "Explanation": "An increase in 'populationInfected' does not necessarily mean that 'populationSize' has increased. It could also be influenced by higher infection rates or less effectiveness in vaccination (if applied). Hence, we cannot infer an increase in 'populationSize' purely based on higher infection counts.",
