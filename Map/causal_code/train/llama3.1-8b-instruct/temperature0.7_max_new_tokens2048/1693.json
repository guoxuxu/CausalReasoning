  "Problem": "var x = 10; var y = 2 * x + 5; var z = y - 4; var w = z + y;\",\n\nIf we set y to 25, will w change from its original calculation?",
  "Explanation": "Setting y to 25 is an intervention that changes its original value derived from x (which is 25). Since z depends on y (z = y - 4), z changes to 21. Consequently, w, which is the sum of the new z and the intervened y, equals 46. This value is different from its initial calculation based on the original values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
