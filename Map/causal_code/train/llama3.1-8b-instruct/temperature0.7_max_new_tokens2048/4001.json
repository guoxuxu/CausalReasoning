  "Explanation": "With this intervention, even though the tax is increased, the discount is subtracted after the tax calculation. Therefore, while the portion of the price increase due to tax is higher, the final amount is adjusted by subtracting a constant discount, preventing a net decrease in `final_price` due to an increase in tax.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
