  "Explanation": "If an external intervention modifies 'medication_taken' to False and update_health_status is called again with this new value, the health condition of 'person' will be set to 'worsened'. This intervention directly influences the effect by changing its cause, demonstrating the pathway from cause to effect with an intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
