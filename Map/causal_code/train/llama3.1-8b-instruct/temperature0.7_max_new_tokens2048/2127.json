  "Explanation": "While temperature is a factor in determining rain status, rain is not solely determined by temperature but also by humidity as per the code. Without knowing the humidity level, one cannot definitively say if an increase in temperature will affect the raining status.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
