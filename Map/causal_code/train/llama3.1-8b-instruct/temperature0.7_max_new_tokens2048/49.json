  "Explanation": "The method `update_temperature` increases the temperature attribute of the instance. If this updated temperature exceeds 30, and the humidity is already over 40, the `apply_heat_index` method would likely return 'High heat index', showing a direct cause (temperature increase) to effect (change in heat index status) relation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
