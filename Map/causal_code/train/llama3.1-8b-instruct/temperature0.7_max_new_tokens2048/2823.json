  "Explanation": "The method update_rain_probability() sets the rain probability to 75 only if the cloud cover is 'high'. There is no other condition in the code that sets rain probability to 75 without the cloud cover being high.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
