  "Explanation": "Intervening to change the weather to 'sunny' directly affects the mood of the population based on the mood() function. The mood 'happy' is the direct outcome of sunny weather, demonstrating a direct causal effect with intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
