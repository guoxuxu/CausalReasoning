  "Explanation": "The return of 'No umbrella needed.' indicates the lack of rain, i.e., a humidity level at or below 80%, but it does not necessarily mean that an intervention like a dehumidifier was used. The initial condition might not have required such intervention or the weather might naturally have low humidity.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "High feels-like temperature and high temperature together do not determine the need to take an umbrella, but low humidity does."
