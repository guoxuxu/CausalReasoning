  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate \n    total_price = price + tax_amount - discount \n    demand = max(0, 100 - total_price) \n    return total_price, demand\n\nprice = 100 \ntax_rate = 0.05 \ndiscount = 10 \n\nrevenue, demand = compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount) \n\n# Implement a promotional campaign \ndef promotion_effect(demand):\n    new_demand = demand + 20 \n    return new_demand\n\n# Calculate new demand after promotion \nnew_demand = promotion_effect(demand)\",\n\nIf the initial price increases, will the demand decrease without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "In the given code, an increase in price results in an increase in total_price, which leads to a decrease in demand since demand is calculated as 100 minus the total_price. This decrease occurs without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
