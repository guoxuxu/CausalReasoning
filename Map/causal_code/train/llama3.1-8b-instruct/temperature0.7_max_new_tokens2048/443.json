  "Explanation": "The apply_promotion() function increases sales by 20 for products with popularity > 5 and by 10 for others; thus, any promotion intervention will always increase sales.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
