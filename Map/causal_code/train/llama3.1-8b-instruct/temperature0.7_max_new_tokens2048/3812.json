  "Explanation": "The code applies a 1.1x multiplier to sales when `ad_budget` is below 30,000 and a 1.3x multiplier in a medium season regardless of store rating. Strategic reduction in ad budgets for lower-rated stores would result in a lesser multiplier effect (1.1x) compared to when the budget is above 30,000 (which could yield a 1.2x multiplier), hence reducing the overall potential sales increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
