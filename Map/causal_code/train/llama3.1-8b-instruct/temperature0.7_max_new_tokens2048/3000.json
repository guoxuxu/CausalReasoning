  "Explanation": "Intervening to change both discounts to 15 inherently changes the output for any input of 100 to 85, independent of the initial coupon codes 'SAVE10' or 'SAVE20'. This represents a controlled scenario where the cause (discount) is uniformly applied to see its direct effect on the final price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
