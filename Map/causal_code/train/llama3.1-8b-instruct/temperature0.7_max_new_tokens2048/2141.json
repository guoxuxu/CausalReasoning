  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand_factor, discount_applied):\n    base_price = price\n    if discount_applied:\n        price = price * 0.9  # 10% discount\n    demand = demand_factor * price\n    sales = price * demand\n    return sales\",\n\nIf a fixed discount is applied, will this increase 'sales' if the 'demand_factor' remains constant?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a discount effectively reduces the 'price'. Although this might increase 'demand' due to the lower price, the overall 'sales', calculated as 'price * demand', may not necessarily increase as the decrease in 'price' could offset the increase in 'demand'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
