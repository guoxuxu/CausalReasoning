  "Explanation": "Within the 'update_inventory' function, the lower the 'current_inventory' after adjusting for 'units_sold_estimate', especially when falling below the threshold of 10, the higher the calculated 'order_quantity'. This happens because there is a direct formula in the code that sets 'order_quantity' based on how low the 'new_inventory' is.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
