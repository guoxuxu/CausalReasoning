  "Explanation": "Manually setting the 'body_temperature' to 40 and running 'check_symptoms()' forces the body temperature to a state that is recognized as a fever (>38), hence 'fever' will be set to true regardless of the previous state or external temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
