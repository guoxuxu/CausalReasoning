  "Explanation": "Making the weather condition 'Rainy' through an external intervention like 'make_rain' doesn't allow us to infer that the weather was already trending towards rainy conditions, as the intervention bypasses natural weather progression by directly setting the humidity high.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
