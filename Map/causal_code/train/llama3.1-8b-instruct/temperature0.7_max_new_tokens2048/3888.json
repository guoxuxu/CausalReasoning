  "Problem": "def product_sales(increase_advertising, current_sales):\n    increased_traffic = increase_advertising * 1.5\n    if increased_traffic > 100:\n        sales_jump = 20\n    else:\n        sales_jump = 5\n    new_sales = current_sales + sales_jump\n    return new_sales\",\n\nIf an external factor manages to triple the base traffic independently, will this affect the sales jump directly?",
  "Explanation": "According to the given code, the sales jump is solely dependent on the increase in traffic directly tied to increased advertising (calculated as 'increased_traffic'). The sales jump is not directly influenced by any external traffic factors but only through the variable 'increase_advertising'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
