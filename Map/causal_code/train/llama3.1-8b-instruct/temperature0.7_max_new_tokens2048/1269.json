  "Explanation": "From the status 'Too hot', which implies that the current temperature is greater than the set point, we cannot conclusively deduce whether the heater was on or off without additional information about the environment temperature. The current temperature could exceed the set point due to a high environment temperature alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
