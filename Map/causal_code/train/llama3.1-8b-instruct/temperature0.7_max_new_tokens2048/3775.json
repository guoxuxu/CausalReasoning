  "Explanation": "High crop yield might be due to either high values of sunlight and rain or the addition of fertilizer. Since both factors play a significant role, high yield alone cannot confirm the addition of fertilizer.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
