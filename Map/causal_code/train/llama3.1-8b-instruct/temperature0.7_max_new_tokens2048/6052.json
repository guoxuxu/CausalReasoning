  "Explanation": "While setting sunny to true increases the temperature by 5 degrees, the 'increaseGlobalWarmingEffect' method also increases the temperature independently by 3 degrees. The temperature could reach 28.0 Celsius either with both global warming effect and sunny weather, or other combinations of these factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
