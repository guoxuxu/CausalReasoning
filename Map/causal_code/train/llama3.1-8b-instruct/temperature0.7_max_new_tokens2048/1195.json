  "Problem": "def compute_salary(base_salary, performance_rating, years_of_experience): \n\\tbonus_percentage = 0.05 * performance_rating \n\\tbonus = base_salary * bonus_percentage \n\\tif years_of_experience > 5: \n\\t\\tbonus += 1000 \n\\treturn base_salary + bonus\",\n\nIf a policy is introduced that increases the base salary, and a decrease in the total salary is observed, can we conclude that performance rating or years of experience decreased?",
  "Explanation": "The policy intervention increases the base salary, which by design should increase total salary. If the total salary decreases instead, it suggests other factors are at play; however, since the bonus is calculated based on performance rating and additional bonus from years of experience, a decrease in either will not affect the amount added to the base salary but rather the bonus part. Thus, the mere observation of a decrease in total salary does not conclusively mean a decrease in performance rating or years of experience.",
