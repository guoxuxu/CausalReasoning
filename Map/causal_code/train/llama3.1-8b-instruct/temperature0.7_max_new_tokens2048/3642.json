  "Problem": "As above\",\n\nIf sunlight was not over 70, would the plant growth rate still increase by 1.5?",
  "Explanation": "From cause to effect without intervention: reducing sunlight below 70 directly affects plant growth by not triggering the sunlight and water condition, regardless of other factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
