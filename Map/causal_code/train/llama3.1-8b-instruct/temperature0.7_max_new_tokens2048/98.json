  "Explanation": "An increase in 'discounted_price' might result from either a decrease in the 'base_discount' or a change in 'incremental_discount' through different 'customer_loyalty_status'. Without specific information about 'customer_loyalty_status' or other factors, a definite cause cannot be assigned solely to changes in 'base_discount'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
