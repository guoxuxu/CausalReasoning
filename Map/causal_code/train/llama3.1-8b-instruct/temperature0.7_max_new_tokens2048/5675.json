  "Problem": "def compute_discount(price, is_member):\n    if is_member:\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0.02\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the price of an item is raised, will the final price in the function also increase?",
  "Explanation": "The final price is calculated as a function of the price and a discount rate. Since the discount percentage remains constant here regardless of the price increase, the final price will still increase proportionally with the initial price, assuming there are no changes in membership status or discount calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
