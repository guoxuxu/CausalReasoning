  "Problem": "def calculate_performance(sales, costs, marketing_expense): \n\\tprofit = sales - costs\n\\tROI = (profit / marketing_expense) * 100\n\\treturn ROI\",\n\nIf an intervention sets 'marketing_expense' to zero and keeps other variables unchanged, what happens to 'ROI'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'marketing_expense' to zero causes a division by zero error when calculating 'ROI', making the operation undefined and leading to a runtime error in the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting marketing expense to zero would directly affect profit, which in turn affects ROI, leading to a decrease in ROI."
