  "Explanation": "The 'new_col' column in the dataframe is calculated as double the 'age' plus 0.3 times the 'income'. Therefore, if the income increases, 'new_col' will also increase, provided the age remains constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
