  "Explanation": "While the activity 'Stay indoor' does suggest it is raining as per decide_activity(), this could also mean that the temperature is not above 80 degrees, hence lack of sufficient evidence to conclude it definitely rained. It's also possible that other unmodeled conditions like a forecast warning influenced this suggestion.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
