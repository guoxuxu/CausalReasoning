  "Explanation": "When a car arrives, it only increases the count of cars waiting in that direction. Clearing cars happens based on cars already waiting when the light was green. New arrivals post-green won't be cleared until the next cycle when the light is green again in their direction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
