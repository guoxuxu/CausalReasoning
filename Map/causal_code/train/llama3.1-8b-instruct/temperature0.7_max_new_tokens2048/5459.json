  "Problem": "Function to determine if health improves based on lifestyle changes and medication.\",\n\nIf lifestyle changes and medication are both applied, will the health score likely exceed the threshold?",
  "Explanation": "Both factors add enough points to exceed the threshold reliably, despite the variability.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
