  "Explanation": "Under the new system change (intervention) that gives an extra 0.05 discount to new customers regardless of age, the discount amount alone (0.25) doesn't uniquely identify the age group (>30 or ≤30) since both age groups could potentially reach the 0.25 discount through varying combinations of age group and new customer status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
