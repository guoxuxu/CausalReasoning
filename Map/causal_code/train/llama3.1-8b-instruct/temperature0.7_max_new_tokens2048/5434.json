  "Explanation": "Though the output of 'adjusted_data' is influenced by the conditional check 'np.mean(data) > 0', observing a specific pattern in 'adjusted_data' alone doesn't conclusively reveal whether the condition was consistently true or false. This is because similar output patterns could potentially arise from variations in the input 'data', affecting both the mean calculation and the normalization independent of the condition being tested.",
