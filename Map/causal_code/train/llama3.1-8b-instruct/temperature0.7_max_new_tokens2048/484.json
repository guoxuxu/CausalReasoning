  "Explanation": "Heavy traffic is a result of rainy weather irrespective of the holiday status. Since heavy traffic occurs with rain regardless of whether it is a holiday, knowing that traffic is heavy doesn't provide information about the holiday status on rainy days.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
