  "Explanation": "Increasing temperature can potentially increase the score depending on the current mood. If the mood is 'happy', scores do not change with temperature increases above 20 degrees. However, if it's 'sad', increasing the temperature from below to above 20 degrees increases the score from 60 to 70.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
