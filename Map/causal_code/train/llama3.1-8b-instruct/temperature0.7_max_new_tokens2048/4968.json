  "Explanation": "Although changing 'is_discounted' affects 'discount_rate', the reverse isn't necessarily true. The 'discount_rate' being 0.0 could either mean 'is_discounted' is False, or the price was set to a value over 20 by 'update_price', which resets both 'is_discounted' and 'discount_rate' regardless of the previous state of 'is_discounted'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A change in 'discount_rate' implies that 'is_discounted' may have been altered, as 'discount_rate' is directly affected by 'is_discounted', and 'update_price' can modify both 'discount_rate' and 'is_discounted'."
