  "Explanation": "While well-being is negatively related to age (higher age can decrease well-being), it is not a unidirectional relationship, as well-being is also heavily influenced by job satisfaction. Thus, a person can still have high well-being with a high age if their job satisfaction is adequately high.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
