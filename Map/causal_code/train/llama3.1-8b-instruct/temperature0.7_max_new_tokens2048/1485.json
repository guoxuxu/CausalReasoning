  "Problem": "int sales = 200; \nint advertising_expense = 50; \nif (advertising_expense > 40) {\n    sales += advertising_expense * 2;\n} else {\n    sales -= 10;\n}\nint customer_feedback = (sales / 10); \nif (customer_feedback > 30) {\n    advertising_expense += 20;\n}\",\n\nIf the company decides to intentionally increase the sales, would increasing the advertising expense when it is currently below 40 be effective?",
  "Explanation": "When the advertising expense is less than or equal to 40, the increment to sales due to advertising is not applied according to the given logic in the code. Increasing the advertising expense in this situation will not effectively increase the sales because there’s a need to cross the threshold of 40 to have an effect on sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
