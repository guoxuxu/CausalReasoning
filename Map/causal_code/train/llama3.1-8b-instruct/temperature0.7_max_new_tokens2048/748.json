  "Problem": "def debug_program(user_input): \n    has_errors = False \n    if 'bug' in user_input: \n        has_errors = True \n    user_experience = 'poor' if has_errors else 'good' \n    return has_errors, user_experience\",\n\nIf the string 'bug' is found in the user_input, will the user_experience always be 'poor'?",
  "Explanation": "The control flow in the function determines that the presence of 'bug' in user_input sets has_errors to True, which directly influences user_experience to be 'poor'. Thus, without any intervention, finding 'bug' in the input invariably leads to a 'poor' user experience.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
