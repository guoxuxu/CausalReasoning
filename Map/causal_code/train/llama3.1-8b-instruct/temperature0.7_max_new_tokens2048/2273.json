  "Problem": "{\n        \"Description\": \"A software module for a content management system where posts by users are automatically categorized based on keywords and tagged by sentiment before being published. The sentiment tagging can occasionally fail due to API timeouts.\",\n        \"Code\": \"def categorize_post(post):\n    keywords = extract_keywords(post.content)\n    category = determine_category(keywords)\n    return category\n\ndef tag_sentiment(post):\n    try:\n        sentiment = sentiment_analysis_api(post.content)\n    except TimeoutError:\n        sentiment = 'Unknown'\n    post.sentiment = sentiment\n    return sentiment\n\ndef publish_post(post):\n    category = categorize_post(post)\n    sentiment = tag_sentiment(post)\n    database.save(post.category, post.sentiment, post.content)\n    return 'Post Published'\"\n    },\n\nIf a new policy requires manual review of posts with 'Unknown' sentiment tags before publishing, will this affect the number of posts published with incorrect categories?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention targets posts based on their sentiment tagging, which is independent of the categorization process. Categorizing posts is handled by a separate function using keywords extracted from the content, not sentiment. Thus, manual review based on sentiment would not impact the accuracy of categories assigned to posts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
