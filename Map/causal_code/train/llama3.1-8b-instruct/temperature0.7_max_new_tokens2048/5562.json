  "Problem": "def update_scores(scores, bonus, penalty): \n    for key, score in scores.items(): \n        if score > 50: \n            scores[key] += bonus \n        else: \n            scores[key] -= penalty \n    return scores\",\n\nAssuming a sudden decrease in most scores, can we infer penalties were increased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in scores could be due to several factors, including increased penalties. However, it could also be influenced by other factors not explicit in the code such as changes to the criteria determining who gets penalized or the introduction of new conditions (e.g., environmental factors) increasing the number of scores under 50. Thus, a direct causal inference here would be unsubstantiated.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
