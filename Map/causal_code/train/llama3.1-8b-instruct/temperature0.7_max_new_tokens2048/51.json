  "Explanation": "Manually invoking `update_temperature` with a positive delta directly changes the `temperature` attribute. Assuming the temperature surpasses 30 and humidity remains over 40, `apply_heat_index` will determine the heat index as 'High'. This demonstrates intervening to witness a change in effect directly stemming from the cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
