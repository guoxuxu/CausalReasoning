  "Problem": "Code provided above\",\n\nIf the prices are manually changed first, then the feedback scores are observed, would this correctly attribute the effect of price changes to customer feedback with intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Manually changing prices does not influence the feedback scores directly because feedback is inherently a customer-generated metric unaffected by explicit manual changes to the price in the system's design.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
