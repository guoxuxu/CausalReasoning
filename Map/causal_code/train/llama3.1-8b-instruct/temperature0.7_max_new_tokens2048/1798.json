  "Problem": "def compute_scores(data):\n    age_adjustment = data['age'] * 0.1\n    experience = data['years_of_experience'] - data['years_of_unemployment'] * 0.5\n    base_score = 70 + experience + age_adjustment\n    if data['has_degree']:\n        base_score += 15\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf 'base_score' is observed to be unusually high, is it correct to assume that 'years_of_unemployment' is very low or zero?",
  "Explanation": "A high 'base_score' cannot definitively indicate that 'years_of_unemployment' are low or zero, as other factors such as 'years_of_experience', 'age', or having a degree could compensate and result in a high score even if 'years_of_unemployment' is significant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
