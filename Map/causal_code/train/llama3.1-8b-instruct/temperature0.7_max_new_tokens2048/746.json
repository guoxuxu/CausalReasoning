  "Explanation": "Introducing a code change that limits transaction quantities will either prevent large quantities from being added at once, leading to multiple logs or an error, thus altering outputs in the log_action method reflecting these changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
