  "Explanation": "According to the condition in the `adjust_heating` function, if the temperature is below 20, the heating device is set to 'on', automatically turning on the heating without manual intervention. This effect is owing to the predefined control logic reacting to the detected temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
