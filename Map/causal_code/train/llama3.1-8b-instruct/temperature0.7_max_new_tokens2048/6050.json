  "Explanation": "The observation of fewer people outside cannot solely lead us to conclude there is higher rainfall because the observed change might be due to the policy effect and not directly due to more rainfall. People might be staying indoors not necessarily because of increased rain but because they are motivated by the incentives of the policy.",
