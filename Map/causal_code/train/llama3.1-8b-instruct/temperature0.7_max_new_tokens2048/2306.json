  "Problem": "def weather_impact(weather, season):\n    if weather == 'rainy' and season == 'winter':\n        return 'snowy'\n    elif weather == 'sunny' and season == 'summer':\n        return 'hot'\n    elif weather == 'cloudy' or (weather == 'rainy' and season == 'summer'):\n        return 'cool'\n    else:\n        return 'mild'\",\n\nIf an external system knew the function returned 'cool', could it determine whether the weather was 'cloudy' or 'rainy' without knowing the season?",
  "Explanation": "The return of 'cool' could either be from 'cloudy' weather regardless of the season, or from 'rainy' weather during 'summer'. Without intervention to specify or control the season, you cannot conclusively determine whether it was 'cloudy' or 'rainy' based solely on the effect of the function returning 'cool'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
