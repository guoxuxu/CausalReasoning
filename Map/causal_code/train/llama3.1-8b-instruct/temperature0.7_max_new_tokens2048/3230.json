  "Explanation": "Although lower temperatures tend to lead to changes in rain status when temperatures drop below 10, the final rain status is directly set by the newRainStatus parameter, not just by the temperature change.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
