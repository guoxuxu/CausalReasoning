  "Explanation": "An increased total sales figure could result from either adding more sales or due to the effects of the 'adjustSalesFigures' method following a promotion. Without additional information on whether new sales were added or promotions were applied, the increase alone cannot definitively indicate a promotion.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
