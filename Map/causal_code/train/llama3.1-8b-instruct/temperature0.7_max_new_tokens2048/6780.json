  "Problem": "Code provided above\",\n\nIf you forcibly overwrite the stock dictionary before calling the refill method, will it influence the method's outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Overwriting the stock dictionary directly affects the inventory state, which in turn changes the behavior of the refill method. Depending on the overwrite, the method might end up adding stock to an item that wasn't there originally or correcting a falsely depleted stock.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Overwriting the stock dictionary → Forcing a potential exception; Forcing a potential exception → Method's outcome is unpredictable",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Overwriting the stock dictionary before calling the refill method forces a potential exception, which makes the method's outcome unpredictable."
