  "Problem": "def compute_interest(account_balance, interest_rate, years):\n    for i in range(years):\n        account_balance += account_balance * interest_rate\n    return account_balance\n\naccount_balance = 1000\ninterest_rate = 0.05\nyears = 5\nfinal_balance = compute_interest(account_balance, interest_rate, years)\nprint('Final balance:', final_balance)\",\n\nIf the interest rate increases, will the final balance be higher, assuming no other changes?",
  "Explanation": "The function compute_interest calculates the final balance by applying the interest rate to the account balance over a number of years. If the interest rate is higher, each year the account balance increases by a greater amount, resulting in a higher final balance after the specified number of years.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
