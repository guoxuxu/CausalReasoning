  "Explanation": "In the code, 'new_value' is calculated as twice the 'value'. Subsequently, 'result' is calculated using 'new_value'. So if 'value' increases, 'new_value' and hence 'result' will increase, provided the 'condition' remains constant.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
