  "Problem": "def compute_health_index(age, diet_quality, exercise_frequency):\n    base_health_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health_score -= (age - 50) * 0.75\n    if diet_quality < 3:\n        base_health_score -= 20\n    else:\n        base_health_score += diet_quality * 5\n    base_health_score += exercise_frequency * 10\n    return base_health_score\",\n\nIf diet quality ratings are adjusted so that each point contributes to an increase of 10 in the index, will this enhance the health index?",
  "Explanation": "If the coefficient of diet quality in the health index formula is increased, then for any given level of diet quality, the contribution to the health index increases, which results in a higher overall health index. This is a direct consequence of artificially modifying the influence of diet quality.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
