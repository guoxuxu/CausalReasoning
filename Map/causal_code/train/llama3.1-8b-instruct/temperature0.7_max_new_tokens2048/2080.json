  "Explanation": "As raw_input decreases, processed_input, which is calculated as double the raw_input, decreases as well. Since analyze_data returns 'Low' for any input less than or equal to 20, a decreased raw_input that leads to a processed_input of 20 or less will change final_result to 'Low'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
