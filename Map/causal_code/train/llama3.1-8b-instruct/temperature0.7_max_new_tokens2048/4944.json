  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n    int temperature;\n    boolean raining;\n\n    WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean rain) {\n        temperature = temp;\n        raining = rain;\n    }\n\n    boolean isStormy() {\n        return raining && temperature < 20;\n    }\n\n    void setTemperature(int newTemp) {\n        temperature = newTemp;\n    }\n\n    void startRain() {\n        raining = true;\n    }\n\n    void stopRain() {\n        raining = false;\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf it is not stormy, can we be certain that it is not raining?",
  "Explanation": "The absence of storminess does not guarantee the absence of rain because storminess also depends on the temperature being below 20 degrees. It could simply be that the temperature is above 20 degrees while it's raining.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
