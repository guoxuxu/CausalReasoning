  "Problem": "class TrafficSystem {\n  boolean trafficLightRed = false;\n  int trafficDensity = 0;\n  int speedLimit = 60;\n\n  void updateTrafficLight(boolean isRed) {\n    trafficLightRed = isRed;\n  }\n\n  void adjustSpeedLimit() {\n    if (trafficLightRed) {\n      speedLimit = 30;\n    } else if (trafficDensity > 50) {\n      speedLimit = 45;\n    } else {\n      speedLimit = 60;\n    }\n  }\n\n  void recordTrafficDensity(int density) {\n    trafficDensity = density;\n    adjustSpeedLimit();\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the speedLimit is observed to be 30, can we be certain that the trafficLightRed is true?",
  "Explanation": "A speedLimit of 30 could either be due to the traffic light being red or high traffic density since both these conditions can result in the same speed adjustment independently in the absence of further context about traffic density.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
