  "Explanation": "Given the rules implemented in the 'setTemperature' method, rain is induced only when the temperature falls below 18 degrees. There's no other mechanism in the code changing the 'isRaining' status, hence, if it's raining, it must be true that the temperature is below 18 degrees.",
