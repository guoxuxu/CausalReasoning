  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, holiday): \n    if holiday: \n        discount_rate *= 1.5 \n    total_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate) \n    tax_amount = total_price * tax_rate \n    final_price = total_price + tax_amount \n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the base_price increases, will the final_price also increase without any other changes?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the base_price leads to a corresponding increase in total_price, holding other variables constant. Since final_price is based on total_price (and scaled by tax and discount factors), it logically follows that an increase in base_price results in an increase in final_price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
