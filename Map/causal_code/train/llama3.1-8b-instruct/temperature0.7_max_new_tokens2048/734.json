  "Problem": "def process(data, flag):\n    if flag:\n        result = sum(data) + 10\n    else:\n        result = sum(data) - 5\n    return result\n\ndata = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nflag = True\noutput = process(data, flag)\nprint(output)\",\n\nIf we manually set 'flag' to False, will we ensure that the output decreases irrespective of the data provided?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'flag' to False changes the formula inside the function to subtract 5 from the sum of 'data'. However, if 'data' contains numbers that total to a sum slightly less or more than when 'flag' was True plus 10, the output might not necessarily decrease (especially near the boundary values like sum 'data' returning 15 when flag was True versus 10 when false).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
