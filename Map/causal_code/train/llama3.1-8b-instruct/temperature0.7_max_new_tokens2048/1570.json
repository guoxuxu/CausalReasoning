  "Explanation": "Cars are only cleared when their waiting direction has a green light. Thus if cars were cleared, it means the light must have been green for their direction at that moment, indicating a switch if it was previously red for that direction.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
