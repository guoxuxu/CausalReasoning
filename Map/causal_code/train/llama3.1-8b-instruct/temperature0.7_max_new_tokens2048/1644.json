  "Explanation": "Low accuracy could result from multiple factors including but not limited to inadequate preprocessing. Factors such as model design, other data manipulations, or the inherent complexities and variations in the data could also lead to low accuracy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
