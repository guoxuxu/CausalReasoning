  "Explanation": "Although reconnection using server.connect() leads to a successful email send, a successful email operation on its own does not imply that reconnection was performed just before it. The server might have been already connected by default or from previous operations. Other factors (like server being initially connected) could also result in the email being sent and cached.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
