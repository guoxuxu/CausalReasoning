  "Problem": "class WeatherPredictor:\n    def __init__(self, temperature, humidity):\n        self.temperature = temperature\n        self.humidity = humidity\n\n    def feels_like(self):\n        adjusted_temp = self.temperature * 1.04 if self.humidity > 80 else self.temperature\n        return adjusted_temp\n\n    def possibility_of_rain(self):\n        return 'High' if self.humidity > 70 else 'Low'\n\",\n\nIf the output of feels_like() is increased, does it imply that humidity has definitely increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in the output of feels_like() could result from an increase in the initial temperature input rather than changes in humidity. Since feels_like() modifies temperature based on a humidity threshold (over 80), an increased output could be solely due to a higher input temperature, irrespective of humidity changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
