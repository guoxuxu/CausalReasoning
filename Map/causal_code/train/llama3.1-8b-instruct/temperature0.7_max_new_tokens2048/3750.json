  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  private int temperature;\n  private boolean raining;\n  public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean rain) {\n    temperature = temp;\n    raining = rain;\n  }\n  public void updateWeather(int newTemp, boolean newRain) {\n    temperature = newTemp;\n    raining = newRain;\n  }\n  public String getWeatherStatus() {\n    if (temperature > 20 && !raining) {\n      return \"sunny\";\n    } else if (temperature <= 20 || raining) {\n      return \"cloudy\";\n    }\n    return \"unclear\";\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the temperature is above 20 and it is not raining, will the weather status definitely be 'sunny'?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code logic in the 'getWeatherStatus' method, a temperature above 20 and the absence of rain results in a weather status of 'sunny'. There are no other conditions affecting this outcome in the given method, thus guaranteeing the 'sunny' status.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
