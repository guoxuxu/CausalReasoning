  "Explanation": "The change in the condition to 'modified_data' > 10 makes it impossible to infer the original 'input_data' accurately, because any 'input_data' resulting in 'modified_data' greater than 10 (i.e., 'input_data' > 5) would now lead to True. Thus, we cannot conclude the specific range of the original 'input_data' without knowing its unmodified result.",
