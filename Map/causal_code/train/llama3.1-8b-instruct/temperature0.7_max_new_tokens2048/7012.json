  "Problem": "def compute_score(health_index, environment_factor, genetic_factor):\n    base_score = 50\n    adjusted_health_score = base_score + (health_index * 10) - (environment_factor * 5)\n    final_score = adjusted_health_score + (genetic_factor * 15)\n    return final_score\",\n\nIf you could control the environment_factor to zero, how would an increase in health_index affect the final_score?",
  "Explanation": "Setting environment_factor to zero simplifies the function by removing its impact from the adjusted_health_score calculation. Any increase in health_index results directly in the increase in final_score because the adverse effect of environment_factor is neutralized (set to zero). Thus, we are seeing the causal impact of health_index on final_score with an intervention on environment_factor.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
