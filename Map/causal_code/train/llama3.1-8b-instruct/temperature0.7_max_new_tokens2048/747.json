  "Explanation": "Frequent logs indicating stock removal simply reflect repetitive calls to remove_stock. Without additional evidence on code changes, it cannot be concluded that new restrictions were placed; the activity might be due to normal operations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
