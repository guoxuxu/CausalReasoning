  "Explanation": "The final state of temperature being 60 degrees does not reveal the explicit usage of the constructor to set it initially because other methods could change it. However, considering this specific code pattern and no external modification to temperature outside of this class, it is appropriate to infer indirectly that the original setting from the constructor caused the initial setting. Answer should be 'Yes', considering no external interaction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
