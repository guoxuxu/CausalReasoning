  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'price' in data and 'quantity' in data: \n        revenue = data['price'] * data['quantity'] \n    else: \n        revenue = 0 \n    data['revenue'] = revenue \n    if revenue > 1000: \n        data['category'] = 'High' \n    else: \n        data['category'] = 'Low' \n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'category' is manually set to 'High', does this indicate that the 'revenue' is necessarily greater than 1000?",
  "Explanation": "Manually setting the 'category' to 'High' does not provide any information about the actual calculation or value of 'revenue'. The category could have been set to 'High' through an error or intervention, and not necessarily because 'revenue' was greater than 1000 as required by the code logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
