  "Problem": "def calculate_health(player_age, hours_played):\n\\tif player_age < 18:\n\\t\\thealth = 100 - (hours_played * 2)\n\\telse:\n\\t\\thealth = 100 - hours_played\n\\thours_played += 1\n\\treturn {'age': player_age, 'hours': hours_played, 'health': health}\n\nresult = calculate_health(25, 5)\",\n\nIf we force a recalibration of the health decrement to be 0.5x for all players, will an older player's health decline less rapidly with each additional hour played?",
  "Explanation": "By reducing the decrement to 0.5 times the hours played irrespective of age, the impact of additional hours on health becomes less severe than under the original conditions stated in the code, especially for those over 18 as originally their health decreased by 1 hour per 1 point.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
