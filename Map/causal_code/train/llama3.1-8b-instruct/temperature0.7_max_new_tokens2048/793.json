  "Explanation": "While receiving multiple 'A' events can set the flag to true, the current state of the flag doesn't necessarily indicate which type of event was last received, as subsequent 'B' events, resetting the counter to 0 and flag to false, could have occurred without changing the current observation of the flag if it wasn’t checked in between.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
