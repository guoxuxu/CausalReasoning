  "Explanation": "In the original code, 'sales' are calculated based on 'price' and 'ad_budget'. There is no mechanism by which increasing 'sales' directly affects 'ad_budget'. Changes in 'sales' are an effect of 'ad_budget' and 'price' changes, not a cause of them.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
