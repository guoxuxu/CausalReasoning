  "Explanation": "Considering that the primary factors for user2's health risk assessment are activity levels and diet quality, improving their health risk from 'high' to 'moderate' with exercise intervention would logically be linked to an improvement in activity level. This intervention directly targets and alters the cause (activity level), thereby affecting the observed effect (health risk status).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
