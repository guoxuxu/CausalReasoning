  "Explanation": "No change in weight does not exclusively imply that the calorie intake was below 700 per meal, as weight can be influenced by multiple factors including steps taken. It’s possible that the user might be consuming high-calorie meals but compensating with a higher number of steps or other factors not described in the code that maintain or reduce weight.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
