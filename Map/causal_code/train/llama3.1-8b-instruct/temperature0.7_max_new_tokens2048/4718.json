  "Problem": "class WeatherController { constructor() { this.temperature = 20; this.humidity = 50; } heatUp() { this.temperature += 5; this.updateHumidity(); } cooldown() { this.temperature -= 5; this.updateHumidity(); } updateHumidity() { this.humidity = this.temperature > 25 ? 60 : 40; } } const controller = new WeatherController(); controller.heatUp(); console.log(controller.temperature, controller.humidity);\",\n\nIf an external intervention modifies the humidity directly to 60, would this affect the operational logic or output of the heatUp() or cooldown() methods?",
  "Explanation": "Directly setting the humidity does not alter the operational logic or outputs of heatUp() or cooldown() methods since these methods manipulate temperature independently and adjust humidity based on the new temperature values post-method execution, not the other way around.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Direct modification of humidity does not affect the operational logic or output of heatUp() or cooldown() methods because the updateHumidity() method is dependent on the temperature, not the humidity value set externally."
