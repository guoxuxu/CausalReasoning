  "Explanation": "An increase in 'discounted_price' can result from multiple possible interventions: decreasing 'base_discount', lowering 'customer_loyalty_status', or external factors altering 'item_price' itself. Without direct observation or data about 'customer_loyalty_status', we cannot conclusively attribute the increased 'discounted_price' to a decrease in discount via changing loyalty status alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
