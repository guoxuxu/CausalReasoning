  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand_factor, tax_rate, discount): \n    base_price = price * demand_factor\n    if tax_rate > 0:\n        taxed_price = base_price * (1 + tax_rate)\n    else:\n        taxed_price = base_price\n    final_price = taxed_price - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the 'demand_factor' increases, will the 'final_price' necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'demand_factor' increases the 'base_price'. However, whether the 'final_price' increases depends on the 'tax_rate' and 'discount'. A higher 'base_price' could be offset by a higher 'discount', hence not necessarily increasing the 'final_price'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in demand_factor will necessarily lead to an increase in final_price, because it increases base_price, which in turn increases taxed_price, which then increases final_price."
