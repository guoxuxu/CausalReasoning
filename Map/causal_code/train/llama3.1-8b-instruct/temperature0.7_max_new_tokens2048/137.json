  "Explanation": "Age itself, in the provided code, does not directly influence the BMI calculation or the health risk category. While age-related factors can influence weight or muscle/fat ratio (thereby impacting BMI indirectly), the code strictly uses weight and height to calculate BMI. Therefore, aging without changes in weight or height does not alter the health risk category.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
