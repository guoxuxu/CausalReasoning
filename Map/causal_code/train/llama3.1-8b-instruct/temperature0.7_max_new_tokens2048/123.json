  "Explanation": "Given the control implementation in 'setTemperature', the heating is turned off only if the temperature goes above 25 degrees Celsius. Manually setting the temperature to 22 will thus not affect the previous state unless it was already above 25, in which case it remains off.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
