  "Explanation": "Setting all 'ages' to 30 normalizes part of the computation for 'salary', eliminating variation from ages. Though 'salary' still involves random categories and their respective age increases, the intervention stabilizes one key variable, illustrating a controlled, causal impact from an intervention (setting ages) to an effect (salary normalization).",
