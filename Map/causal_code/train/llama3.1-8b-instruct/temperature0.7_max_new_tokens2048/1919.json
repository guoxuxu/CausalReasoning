  "Explanation": "The 'vaccinate' method describes a reduction in patient count especially during flu season by a factor influenced by the percentage of patients vaccinated. Thus, vaccinating 30% of patients during flu season specifically leads to a reduction in the patient count due to a 30% vaccination factor reducing flu-related admissions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
