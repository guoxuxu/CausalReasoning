  "Explanation": "If the prepared equipment includes 'books', it means the activity planned was 'library visit', which according to the 'decide_activity' function, only happens when the weather is 'cloudy'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
