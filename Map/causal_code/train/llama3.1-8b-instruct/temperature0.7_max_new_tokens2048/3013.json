  "Explanation": "While 'class' being 'middle' does indeed reflect an 'income' between 30000 and 50000 under normal circumstances, it does not confirm whether this was set intentionally or happened naturally, as the function sets 'class' merely based on 'income' values and lacks context on the intentionality of the income setting.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
