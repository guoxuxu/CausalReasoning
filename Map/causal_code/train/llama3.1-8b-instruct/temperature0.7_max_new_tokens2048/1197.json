  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    result = []\n    for datum in data:\n        computed = datum * 2\n        if computed > 10:\n            result.append(computed)\n    return result\",\n\nIf the output list is empty, can it be concluded that the input data list did not contain any numbers greater than 5?",
  "Explanation": "The input list might still contain numbers greater than 5 but less than or equal to 5.5 since doubling these numbers would not exceed 10, hence they wouldn't be appended to the result list.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
