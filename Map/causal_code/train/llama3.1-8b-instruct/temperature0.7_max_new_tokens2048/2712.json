  "Explanation": "Intervening by restocking (increase inventory through the 'restock' function) can indeed change the outcome of a subsequent sale attempt. For instance, if previously a sale attempt would have failed due to insufficient inventory, restocking could make it successful.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
