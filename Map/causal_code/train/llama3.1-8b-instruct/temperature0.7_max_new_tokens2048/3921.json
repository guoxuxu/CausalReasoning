  "Explanation": "Changing the scholarship amount manually does not affect the student's age. The scholarship and age fields are causally independent in this way; the age determines the scholarship but not the other way around when manipulated directly. Therefore, increasing the scholarship doesn’t necessarily mean the student is younger.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
