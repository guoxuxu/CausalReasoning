  "Problem": "class WeatherStation { float temperature = 25.0; boolean isRaining = false; void updateWeather(float newTemp, boolean rainStatus) { temperature = newTemp; isRaining = rainStatus; } float getTemperature() { return temperature; } boolean getRainStatus() { return isRaining; } } WeatherStation station = new WeatherStation(); station.updateWeather(30.0, true); float currentTemp = station.getTemperature(); boolean currentRainStatus = station.getRainStatus();\",\n\nIf we call the 'updateWeather' method to set the temperature to 30.0 degrees, will 'getTemperature' definitely return 30.0 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "The 'updateWeather' method directly updates the 'temperature' attribute of the 'WeatherStation' instance. Whenever 'getTemperature' is subsequently called, it retrieves the current value of 'temperature', which would be 30.0 after the method call.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
