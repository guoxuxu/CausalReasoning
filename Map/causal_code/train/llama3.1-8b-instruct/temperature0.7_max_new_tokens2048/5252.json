  "Problem": "def update_temperature(weather, heating_on): \n    if weather == 'cold': \n        base_temp = 50 \n    else: \n        base_temp = 70 \n    if heating_on: \n        base_temp += 20 \n    return base_temp\",\n\nIf the returned temperature is higher than usual, can we conclude the weather was cold without further information?",
  "Explanation": "A higher temperature can result from either the weather being cold and having the heating turned on (50 + 20 = 70) or from the weather not being cold and having the heating turned on (70 + 20 = 90) or even not cold without heating (70). Therefore, a higher temperature is not exclusively due to cold weather.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
