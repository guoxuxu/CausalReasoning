  "Explanation": "Given the method set_temperature directly sets the temperature and updates the weather status to 'cold' if the temperature is 20 degrees or less, setting it to 10 degrees will override any previous weather conditions and set the status to 'cold', independent of the humidity or previous status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
