  "Explanation": "A spike in sales following an intervention could be the result of different factors manipulated, including a change in month (leading to different seasonal effects) or a direct manipulation of base sales; merely observing a spike in sales does not conclusively indicate that the change was due to an increase in advertising budget.",
