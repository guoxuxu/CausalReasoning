  "Explanation": "The update_inventory function reduces the inventory count of each sold item, hence more items sold will deplete the inventory levels.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If more items are sold, the inventory levels will decrease because the quantity of items sold directly influences the quantity of items sold, which in turn influences the inventory levels, and if the inventory levels fall below 5, restocking will occur, which increases the inventory levels."
