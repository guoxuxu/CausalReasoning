  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, a higher price directly reduces the base_sales as seen from the code `base_sales = 100 - price`. This implies that increased price inherently results in reduced sales, independent of the marketing spend.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
