  "Explanation": "Even with a set `weekend`, the `total_sales` is influenced not only by `location_type` but also by the `weekend` status. Adjusting `total_sales` through intervention doesn't distinctly reveal the `location_type`, because the same sales figure could potentially be achieved in different locations under varying weekend conditions.",
