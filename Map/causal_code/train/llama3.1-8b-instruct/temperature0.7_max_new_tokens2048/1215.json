  "Problem": "def calculate_health_score(age, weight, activity_level, smoked): \n    base_score = 100 \n    age_penalty = (age - 30) / 2 if age > 30 else 0 \n    weight_penalty = (weight - 150) * 0.1 if weight > 150 else 0 \n    activity_bonus = 20 if activity_level == 'high' else (-20 if activity_level == 'low' else 0) \n    smoking_penalty = 50 if smoked else 0 \n    health_score = base_score - age_penalty - weight_penalty + activity_bonus - smoking_penalty \n    return health_score\",\n\nIf we witness an increase in health_score, can we infer the individual has started a high activity level?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in health_score could be due to a variety of reasons such as lower age_penalty, lower weight_penalty, or ceasing to smoke, along with an increase in activity level. The presence of multiple influencing factors means that an increase alone does not conclusively indicate that the individual has commenced a high activity level. This represents an analysis from an effect to a prespective cause with an intervention, showing the caution needed in attributing a cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
