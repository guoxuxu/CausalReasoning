  "Problem": "public class WeatherSimulator { int temperature; boolean isRaining; public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean rain) { this.temperature = temp; this.isRaining = rain; } public void updateWeather(int newTemp, boolean newRain) { this.temperature = newTemp; this.isRaining = newRain; } public boolean isCold() { return this.temperature < 50; } public boolean willRainSoon() { return this.isRaining && this.temperature < 60; } }\",\n\nIf the method willRainSoon() returns true, can we conclude the temperature was below 60?",
  "Explanation": "The method willRainSoon() returns true only if it is raining and the temperature is below 60. Therefore, if this method returns true, it necessarily implies that the temperature was below 60.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
