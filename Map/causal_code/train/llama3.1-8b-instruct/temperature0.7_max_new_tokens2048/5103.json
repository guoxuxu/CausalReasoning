  "Problem": "def calculate_bonus(salary, performance_rating):\n    if performance_rating > 8:\n        bonus = salary * 0.2\n    elif performance_rating > 5:\n        bonus = salary * 0.1\n    else:\n        bonus = 0\n    return bonus\",\n\nIf the performance_rating increases from 6 to 9, will the bonus increase?",
  "Explanation": "The code specifies that a performance rating above 8 results in a higher bonus rate (20% of the salary) compared to a rating just above 5 (which gets 10%). Therefore, increasing the performance rating from 6 to 9 will indeed increase the bonus according to the predefined logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in performance rating causes an increase in the salary multiplier, which in turn causes an increase in the bonus."
