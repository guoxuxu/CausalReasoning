  "Problem": "class SalesAnalysis { double discount; double price; double increaseTraffic(double factor) { return factor * 0.5; } double salePrice() { return price - (price * discount); } }\",\n\nDoes a decrease in 'salePrice' imply an increase in 'discount' without intervening in other factors?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'salePrice' could also be caused by a decrease in the original 'price', not necessarily by an increase in 'discount'. Without additional information or control of other factors, the cause of the change in 'salePrice' can't be uniquely determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
