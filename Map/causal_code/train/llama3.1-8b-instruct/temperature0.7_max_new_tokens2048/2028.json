  "Problem": "def update_user_score(user, score_increase, bonus_applied=False):\n    if bonus_applied:\n        user['score'] += score_increase * 1.1\n    else:\n        user['score'] += score_increase\n\nuser = {'name': 'John', 'score': 50}\nupdate_user_score(user, 20, bonus_applied=True)\",\n\nIf the final score increased by more than 20 points, can we infer that the bonus was necessarily applied?",
  "Explanation": "Since the regular score increase (without bonus) matches the 'score_increase' and any amount more than that must be through the 1.1 multiplier, applied only when 'bonus_applied' is True. Thus, a final score increase of more than 20 implies the bonus was applied.",
