  "Explanation": "The 'daily_customers' method computes number_of_customers based on the product of the number_of_shops and the increase_factor. An increase in the number_of_shops leads to an increase in the number_of_customers, given a constant increase_factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
