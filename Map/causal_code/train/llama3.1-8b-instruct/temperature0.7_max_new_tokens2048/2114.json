  "Problem": "TrafficControlSystem class definition with methods to manage traffic based on car and pedestrian densities.\",\n\nKnowing the crosswalk signal changed externally to 'Walk', can we determine a change in the traffic light status?",
  "Explanation": "Updates to the crosswalk_signal putatively depend on pedestrian_density, not directly influencing or reflecting changes in the traffic_light unless the logic within the system explicitly links these variables, which in the original code they do not.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
