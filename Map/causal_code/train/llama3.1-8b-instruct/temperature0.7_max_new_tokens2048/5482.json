  "Explanation": "The post-intervention increase in 'discounted_price' after surpassing 100 sales is influenced by a conditional increase in the method 'make_sale' and not directly correlated with the initial state of 'discount'. The increase is due primarily to operational logic in the sales method, rather than an original discount setting.",
