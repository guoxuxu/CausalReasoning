  "Explanation": "The health class checks if the pollution level where John lives (9) is greater than 8; if so, the sickness is determined by a random condition factor. The higher the pollution level, the more likely that the condition factor threshold (>2) will categorize John as sick.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
