  "Explanation": "If the air quality changes to 'Good' following an intervention, it must mean that both the conditions required by the `check_air_quality` method are true: the air purifier is on and the filter is not dirty. This inherently suggests that the intervention involved both cleaning the filter and turning on the machine.",
