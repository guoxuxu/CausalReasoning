  "Explanation": "Decreasing the temperature alone does not always increase the likelihood of rain. It depends on the humidity as well. If the humidity is not over 85, just lowering the temperature below 20 doesn't necessarily lead to a higher likelihood unless the humidity criteria is also met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
