  "Problem": "def process_data(data, factor, offset): \n\\tadjusted_data = [x * factor for x in data] \n\\tfinal_data = [y + offset for y in adjusted_data] \n\\treturn final_data \n\nresult = process_data([1, 2, 3], 2, 5)\",\n\nAfter manually setting 'offset' to zero, if 'factor' is doubled, will this result in doubling of 'final_data'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'offset' to zero removes it from influencing the final outcome. In this case, 'final_data' becomes directly proportional to 'adjusted_data', which is in turn directly proportional to 'factor'. Therefore, doubling 'factor' will double the values in both 'adjusted_data' and 'final_data'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
