  "Explanation": "The 'change_price' method updates the 'price' and immediately recalculates 'sales' via the 'calculate_sales' method. Setting a new lower price can make the product's price more competitive compared to 'competitor_price', likely leading to an increase in 'sales' as modeled in 'calculate_sales'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
