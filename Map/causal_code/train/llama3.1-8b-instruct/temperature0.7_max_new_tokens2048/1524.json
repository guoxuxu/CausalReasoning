  "Explanation": "Although an increase in daily steps beyond 10,000 decreases weight, weight could also change due to changes in calorie intake (eating more than 700 calories increases the weight by 0.2). Thus, weight decrease alone doesn't definitively indicate an increase in steps as the cause without knowing the food intake.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
