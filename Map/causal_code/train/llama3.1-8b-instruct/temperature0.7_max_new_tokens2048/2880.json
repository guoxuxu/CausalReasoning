  "Explanation": "Adding 5 to each data item before processing (an intervention) would change the original parity of all numbers (odd numbers become even and vice versa). Therefore, the processing after this adjustment—multiplying even numbers by 10 and adding 10 to odd numbers—would not reflect the original numerical categorization.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
