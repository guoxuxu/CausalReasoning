  "Problem": "def increment(x): return x + 1\ndef double(x): return x * 2\ndef process_data(x): y = increment(x); z = double(y); return z\",\n\nIf the output `z` is modified through an external intervention to a specific higher value, can this indicate the original input `x` was also higher?",
  "Explanation": "By externally setting the output `z` to a specific value, it decouples the natural causation chain within the `process_data` function. With `z` set independently of `y` or `x`, changes in `z` provide no information about the original inputs since `z` is no longer a product of `y` calculated from `x`. The intervention breaks the causal link that would normally allow `z` to infer values of `x`.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
