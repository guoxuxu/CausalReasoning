  "Problem": "from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n# Loading the diabetes dataset\nX, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)\n\n# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Creating a RandomForest Classifier\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier()\n\n# Fitting the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predicting the test set results\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\",\n\nIf we manually modify the random_state in the train_test_split function to a different fixed number, will this likely change the model's accuracy on the test set?",
  "Explanation": "Changing 'random_state' alters the random seed used to shuffle the data before splitting. This results in different subsets of data in the training and testing sets, potentially impacting the model's learned parameters and its resulting accuracy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
