  "Explanation": "Setting 'reinvestment' to 0 manually does not provide information about the actual 'net_profit', as the intervention disrupts the natural causation from 'net_profit' to 'reinvestment'. The 'net_profit' could technically be anything, but the manual intervention overrides this.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
