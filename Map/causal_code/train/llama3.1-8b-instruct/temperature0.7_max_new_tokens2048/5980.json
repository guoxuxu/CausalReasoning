  "Explanation": "The fact that it starts raining indicates that the temperature has gone below 20 degrees, but this does not necessarily mean that the season has changed to Winter. The temperature could have been affected by other factors or might have already been below 20 degrees irrespective of a shift in season.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
