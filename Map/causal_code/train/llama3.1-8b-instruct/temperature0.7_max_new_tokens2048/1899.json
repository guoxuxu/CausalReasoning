  "Explanation": "By calling the `connect` method and setting `self.connected` to True (provided the `db_type` is 'SQL'), the database is in a connected state, allowing `add_record` to successfully add records.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
