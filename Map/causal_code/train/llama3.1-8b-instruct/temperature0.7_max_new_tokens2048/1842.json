  "Explanation": "Given the code structure, 'speed' can only be greater than 0 if the engine has been started (as initially, 'speed' is set to 5 upon starting the engine), and further increases can only occur if the engine is on and 'accelerate' method is called. Therefore, a non-zero speed infers that the engine is necessarily on.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
