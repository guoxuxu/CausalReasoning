  "Explanation": "A health status of 'high' can be because either the age is over 50 with a low activity level, or other conditions in a modified or extended version of the code that aren't visible in this snippet. We only know that one possible route to a 'high' status is an age over 50 combined with low activity, but it's not a definitive cause because we haven't examined all possible pathways or conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
