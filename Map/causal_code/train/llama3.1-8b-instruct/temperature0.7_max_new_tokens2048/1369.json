  "Explanation": "When temperature is forced above 30 degrees, calling updateTemperature() during evaluateComfort() will only decrease the temperature by 2 degrees, keeping it above the minimum of 23 degrees required to be considered 'Hot'. Thus, evaluateComfort() will consistently declare it 'Hot'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
