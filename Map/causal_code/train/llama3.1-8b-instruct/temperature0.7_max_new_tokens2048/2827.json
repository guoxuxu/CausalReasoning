  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag): \n    result = [] \n    if flag: \n        for d in data: \n            if d % 2 == 0: \n                result.append(d ** 2) \n    else: \n        for d in data: \n            if d % 2 != 0: \n                result.append(d + 1) \n    return result\",\n\nDoes obtaining a list with values incremented by 1 imply that the 'flag' condition was set to False?",
  "Explanation": "In the function 'process_data', if 'flag' is False, it processes odd integers by adding 1 to each and appending to 'result'. Thus, if the output contains values incremented by 1, it indicates the input consisted of odd integers and the 'flag' was set to False.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
