  "Explanation": "While observing a 'jacket' suggests temperatures between 15 to 20 degrees, this condition could happen in Los Angeles as well, if the random variation decreases the temperature slightly. Thus, you cannot conclusively intervene and assume the city based just on the observation of the 'jacket'.",
