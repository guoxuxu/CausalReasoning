  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, demand, discount_flag):\n    adjusted_prices = {}\n    for item, price in prices.items():\n        if demand[item] > 100:\n            if discount_flag:\n                adjusted_prices[item] = price * 0.9\n            else:\n                adjusted_prices[item] = price * 1.05\n        else:\n            adjusted_prices[item] = price\n    return adjusted_prices\",\n\nIf observing that the price of an item has decreased, can we conclude the discount_flag was set to True?",
  "Explanation": "A price decrease might suggest the discount_flag was set to True especially under high demand conditions, but it's not an inevitable conclusion without further information—prices could theoretically be decreased by other external factors or promotions not modeled in this code. This demonstrates the complexity of drawing effect-to-cause conclusions with interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
