  "Problem": "def process_data(input_list):\n    modified_list = [x * 2 for x in input_list]\n    final_sum = sum(modified_list)\n    if final_sum > 100:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    return result\n\ndata = [10, 20, 30]\noutput = process_data(data)\",\n\nDoes the truth value of `result` allow us to infer the exact elements of `input_list`?",
  "Explanation": "The truth value of `result` only indicates whether the sum of double the values in `input_list` exceeds 100 or not. Multiple `input_list` configurations could yield the same `result`, making precise inference about `input_list` elements impossible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
