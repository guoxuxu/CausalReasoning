  "Problem": "def calculate_profit(revenue, costs, tax_rate): \n    profit_before_tax = revenue - costs \n    tax = profit_before_tax * tax_rate \n    profit_after_tax = profit_before_tax - tax \n    return profit_after_tax\",\n\nIf we observe a decreased profit_after_tax while keeping revenue fixed, did costs necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "While keeping revenue constant, a decrease in profit_after_tax could imply an increase in costs; however, it could also be due to an increase in the tax_rate. Since both these factors can independently influence profit_after_tax, we cannot definitively say that only an increase in costs caused the decrease in profit_after_tax without specifying the behavior of the tax_rate in this scenario.",
