  "Problem": "def update_temperature(location, date, adjustment):\n    base_temp = weather_api.get_temperature(location, date)\n    if location == 'desert':\n        adjusted_temp = base_temp + adjustment * 1.5\n    else:\n        adjusted_temp = base_temp + adjustment\n    return adjusted_temp\",\n\nIf 'location' is 'desert', will 'adjusted_temp' potentially be higher even if 'adjustment' is zero?",
  "Explanation": "The code increases the 'adjusted_temp' by 1.5 times the 'adjustment' in desert locations. However, even if the 'adjustment' is zero, the 'adjusted_temp' will equal 'base_temp', which does not necessarily mean it's higher; 'base_temp' itself can vary. The question's phrasing might suggest that in desert, inherently, temperatures could be higher, but this solely depends on 'base_temp' from the 'weather_api', not due to the multiplication factor in the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
