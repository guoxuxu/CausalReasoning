  "Explanation": "While being sunny typically implies that the temperature is above 20, the implementation always sets 'isSunny' based on the temperature being greater than 20. However, without additional information or the current state (e.g., just after it stops raining), we can't infer this as certain if we only observe 'isSunny' without knowing recent weather changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
