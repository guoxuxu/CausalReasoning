  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private float temperature; private boolean raining; public void setTemperature(float temp) { temperature = temp; if (temp < 32) { raining = false; } } public boolean isRaining() { return raining; } public void startRain() { if (temperature > 50) { raining = true; } } }\",\n\nIf it is observed that it is not raining, can we conclude the temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit?",
  "Explanation": "The fact that it is not raining only implies that it either hasn’t been triggered to start rain or the temperature is below 32 degrees. Since raining can also be false if the temperature is above 50 degrees and startRain() was not called, we cannot conclusively determine the exact temperature range just from the absence of rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
