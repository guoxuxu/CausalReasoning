  "Problem": "def compute_bonus(sales, quota):\n    if sales > quota:\n        return 0.1 * (sales - quota)\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ndef main():\n    sales = 15000\n    quota = 10000\n    bonus = compute_bonus(sales, quota)\n    print('Bonus for the employee:', bonus)\n\nmain()\",\n\nIf the 'sales' value increases, will the 'bonus' definitely increase?",
  "Explanation": "The bonus is directly proportional to the amount by which sales exceed the quota. Therefore, increasing sales, provided they are above the quota, directly increases the bonus calculated by 10% of the excess.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
