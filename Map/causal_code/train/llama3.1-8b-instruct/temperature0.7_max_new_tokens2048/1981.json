  "Explanation": "Without the deposit method call, the initial balance was 100 and only 150 was attempted to be withdrawn, which would adjust the balance but not to 150. The balance would be -50 assuming the operations could continue, but by the given code, the withdraw operation would not proceed without enough balance, hence the final_balance would not be 150 but remain 100.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
