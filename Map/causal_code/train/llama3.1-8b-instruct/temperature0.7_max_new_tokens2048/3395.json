  "Problem": "def price_calculator(age, student, coupon_code):\n    base_price = 100\n    age_discount = 20 if age < 18 else 0\n    student_discount = 10 if student else 0\n    coupon_discount = 30 if coupon_code == 'SAVE30' else 0\n    final_price = base_price - age_discount - student_discount - coupon_discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final price is 90, does it necessarily imply that the person is a student?",
  "Explanation": "A final price of 90 can be achieved through different combinations of discounts, such as being under 18 or using a 'SAVE30' coupon, aside from just being a student. There's no direct causal relationship that can conclusively determine the person is a student based solely on the final price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "age < 18 → age_discount; student → student_discount; coupon_code == 'SAVE30' → coupon_discount; age_discount, student_discount, coupon_discount → final_price; final_price → 90; student → student_discount; student_discount + age_discount + coupon_discount → final_price"
