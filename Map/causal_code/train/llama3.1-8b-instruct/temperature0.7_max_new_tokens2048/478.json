  "Explanation": "An increase in heart risk could also be due to aging over 50 or a decrease in fitness level. Without additional information, one cannot conclusively attribute the rise in risk to smoking alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
