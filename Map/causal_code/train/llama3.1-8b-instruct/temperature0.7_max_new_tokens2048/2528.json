  "Problem": "Python code provided above.\",\n\nIf 'issue_alert' method returns 'High Alert', does it imply that 'SO2' concentrations must have been high?",
  "Explanation": "Although high 'SO2' concentrations contribute to a higher pollution index, a 'High Alert' can also be triggered by high values of 'CO', 'NO2', or 'PM2.5'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "SO2 concentration → Air Quality; Air Quality → issue_alert; issue_alert → 'High Alert'; 'High Alert' → implication of high SO2 concentration"
