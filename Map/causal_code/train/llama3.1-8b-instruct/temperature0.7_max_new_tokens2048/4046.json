  "Problem": "class SalesData { constructor(year) { this.year = year; this.salesFigures = {}; this.inflationRate = 0.03; } updateSales(month, value) { this.salesFigures[month] = value; } applyInflation() { Object.keys(this.salesFigures).forEach(month => { this.salesFigures[month] *= (1 + this.inflationRate); }); } calculateTotalSales() { return Object.values(this.salesFigures).reduce((total, current) => total + current, 0); } }\",\n\nIf the inflation rate increases, will the calculated total sales amount likely increase without any new sales being recorded?",
  "Explanation": "The calculateTotalSales method sums up the sales figures which are modified by applyInflation method according to the inflation rate. If inflation rate increases, the applyInflation method would adjust the figures upwards, thus increasing the total calculated without new sales records.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
