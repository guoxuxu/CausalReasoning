  "Explanation": "If you intervene to stop the rain (setting 'isRaining' to false), according to the 'updateWeather' method, the temperature will decrease by 10 degrees instead of 5 (which is the decrement used when it is raining). Hence, if there is a significant drop of 10 degrees observed, it is likely due to the intervention of stopping the rain influencing how temperature decrement is calculated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
