  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'sales' in data: \n        data['revenue'] = data['sales'] * data['price'] \n    if data['revenue'] > 1000: \n        data['category'] = 'High' \n    else: \n        data['category'] = 'Low' \n    return data\",\n\nKnowing that an intervention was made to set the 'category' directly to 'High', can we determine the 'sales'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the 'category' directly to 'High' disconnects the natural relationship between 'sales', 'price', 'revenue', and 'category'. Therefore, without this natural progression, you cannot deduce 'sales' information based solely on the intervention-applied 'category'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
