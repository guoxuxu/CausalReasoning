  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 25 degrees followed by checkUmbrellaNeed returning false could occur from either the temperature change or a previous state of no rain. Since the method does not revert the state of rain but merely checks condition at the time of invocation, and given that rain is false if temperature alone was considered (as it checks if temperature <= 20), we cannot assert it was raining previously without more information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
