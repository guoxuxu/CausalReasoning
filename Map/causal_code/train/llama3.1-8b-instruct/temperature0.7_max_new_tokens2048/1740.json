  "Explanation": "Setting the age to 70 meets one of the conditions for 'isAtRisk' to return true, which is being over the age of 65, regardless of the other variable 'hasChronicDisease'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
