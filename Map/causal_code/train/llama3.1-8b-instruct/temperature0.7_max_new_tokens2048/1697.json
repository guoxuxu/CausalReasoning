  "Problem": "class HealthReport { int calories; bool exercise; int stressLevel; void updateExercise(bool didExercise) { exercise = didExercise; if (didExercise) { calories -= 100; } } void updateStressLevel(int workHours) { if (workHours > 8) { stressLevel += 5; } else if (workHours < 5) { stressLevel -= 3; } } }\",\n\nIf we modify the number of work hours to below 5 in the updateStressLevel, will this necessarily reduce the stress level?",
  "Explanation": "Per the updateStressLevel method logic, reducing work hours below 5 leads to a decrease in stress level by 3 units, which is an intended and direct consequence of the function's execution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
