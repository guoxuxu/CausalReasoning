  "Problem": "See above\",\n\nDoes altering `average_result` affect the value of `threshold`?",
  "Explanation": "The value of `average_result` is calculated based on the `threshold`, not vice versa; changing the result does not feedback to affect the input threshold.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
