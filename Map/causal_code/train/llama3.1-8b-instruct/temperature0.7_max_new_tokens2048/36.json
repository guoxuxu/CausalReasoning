  "Explanation": "High visitor satisfaction could result from either an independently good weather, comfortable temperature, or both. Even though optimal intervention on both factors might be a likely reason for high satisfaction, it's not the only possibility. Other uncontrolled combinations (warm temperature or sunny conditions alone) could also lead to high satisfaction scores. Thus, consistent high satisfaction doesn't conclusively indicate successful intervention on both fronts.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
