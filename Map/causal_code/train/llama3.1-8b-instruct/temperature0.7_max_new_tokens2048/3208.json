  "Problem": "def calculateInterest(balance, rate): \n    if balance > 1000: \n        interest = balance * (rate / 100) \n    else: \n        interest = balance * (rate / 2 / 100) \n    return interest\",\n\nIf an intervention sets the rate to double its previous value, will the interest increase?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the rate directly influences the interest calculation in the function, leading to doubling of the interest output if balance remains unchanged, thereby increasing overall interest.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
