  "Problem": "def compute_score(temperature, humidity):\n    discomfort_index = (0.81 * temperature) + 0.01 * humidity * (0.99 * temperature - 14.3) + 46.3\n    if discomfort_index > 80:\n        return 'High'\n    elif discomfort_index > 60:\n        return 'Moderate'\n    else:\n        return 'Low'\n\nresult = compute_score(30, 70)\",\n\nIf the discomfort index is 'High', was the temperature likely to be high?",
  "Explanation": "Since the discomfort index uses a formula where temperature strongly influences the outcome, a 'High' discomfort index generally implies a higher temperature input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
