  "Explanation": "The 'High risk of frost' alert is only issued if the temperature is below 0 and the humidity is above 80. Thus, there is a direct causal relationship where the issuing of this type of alert implies that the temperature condition was below zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
