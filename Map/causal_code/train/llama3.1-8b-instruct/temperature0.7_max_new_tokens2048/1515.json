  "Explanation": "The code shows that if the age is over 50 and the person does not have diabetes, the `calculate_risk` method returns 'Moderate'. This means that aging increases the risk level to 'Moderate' even without diabetes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
