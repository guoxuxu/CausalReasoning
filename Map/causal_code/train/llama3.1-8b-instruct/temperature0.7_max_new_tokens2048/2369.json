  "Problem": "int calculateProduct(int a, int b) { return a * b; } int main() { int x = 5; int y = 10; int z = calculateProduct(x, y); int w = z + 10; return w; }\",\n\nIf we manually set 'z' to a higher value, will this necessarily impact the value of 'w'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'z' to a higher value directly impacts 'w' since 'w' is computed as 'z' plus 10. The calculation of 'w' does not depend on 'x' and 'y' once 'z' is set explicitly to a new value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
