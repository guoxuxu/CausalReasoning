  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { constructor(temperature, humidity) { this.temperature = temperature; this.humidity = humidity; } rainProbability() { return (this.humidity > 80 && this.temperature > 15) ? 80 : (this.humidity > 60 ? 50 : 20); } useEffect() { if (this.temperature > 25) { this.humidity += 5; } else if (this.temperature < 10) { this.humidity -= 10; } } }\",\n\nWill a higher rain probability indicate higher temperatures?",
  "Explanation": "Higher rain probability primarily indicates higher humidity, and while it can be associated with higher temperatures if both factors contribute, it’s not necessary that high temperatures are present. It's possible to have high rain probability with moderate temperatures (above 15°C) if humidity is sufficiently high.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Higher humidity causes higher temperature, which in turn causes higher rain probability, which does not directly indicate higher temperatures, but higher temperature causes higher humidity."
