  "Explanation": "A change in 'revenue' could be due to alterations in either 'tax_percentage' or 'sales_figures'. Without specific intervention or additional information, it is impossible to definitively attribute the change in 'revenue' to 'tax_percentage' alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
