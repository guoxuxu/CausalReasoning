  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'price' in data and 'quantity' in data: \n        revenue = data['price'] * data['quantity'] \n    else: \n        revenue = 0 \n    data['revenue'] = revenue \n    if revenue > 1000: \n        data['category'] = 'High' \n    else: \n        data['category'] = 'Low' \n    return data\",\n\nIf we manually set the 'price' key to 50 and the 'quantity' key to 20, will the 'category' key definitely be 'High'?",
  "Explanation": "Given the 'price' of 50 and 'quantity' of 20, the 'revenue' would be 1000. Based on the code's condition that 'revenue' > 1000 would result in 'category' being set to 'High', manually setting these values causes the 'category' to not reach 'High' since 1000 is not greater than 1000. However, as per common understanding, one might think it be 'High', the specific condition in code (>1000) does not make it 'High'. This would be an edge case misunderstanding.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
