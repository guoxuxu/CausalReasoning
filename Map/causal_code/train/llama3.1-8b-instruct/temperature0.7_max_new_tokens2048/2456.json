  "Explanation": "Seeing more instances of 'Stay indoors' can imply that the Mood instance often evaluates to unhappy, which according to the code happens when it is raining or the temperature is 20 or less. Since no temperature information was specified, increased instance of rain becomes a reasonable inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
