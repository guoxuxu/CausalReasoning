  "Explanation": "The pedestrian_signal function checks if the traffic_light_status is 'Red', if yes, it returns 'Walk'. Hence, changing the traffic_light_status to 'Red' causes the pedestrian signal to show 'Walk'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
