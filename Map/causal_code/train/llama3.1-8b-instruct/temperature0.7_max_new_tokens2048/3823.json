  "Explanation": "While an increase in 'x' would increase 'result', it is not the only factor that can. An increase in 'noise' or a decrease in 'adjustment' can also lead to an increase in 'result'. Hence, without additional information, an increase in 'result' cannot definitively imply an increase in 'x'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
