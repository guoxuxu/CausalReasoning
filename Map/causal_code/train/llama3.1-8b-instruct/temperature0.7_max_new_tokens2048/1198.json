  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    result = []\n    for datum in data:\n        computed = datum * 2\n        if computed > 10:\n            result.append(computed)\n    return result\",\n\nIf you replace 'computed = datum * 2' with 'computed = datum * 3' in the code, will the output list size likely increase for the same input?",
  "Explanation": "Tripling the numbers instead of doubling will result in higher values for each datum, thereby making it more likely that more numbers will exceed the threshold of 10, hence more numbers will be appended to the result list.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
