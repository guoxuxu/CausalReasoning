  "Explanation": "Given the current code structure, only active users' login counts are added to the login_counts dictionary due to the condition 'if user.active' in the dictionary comprehension. If a user’s count is in the dictionary, it can be concluded that they were active at the time of being processed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
