  "Explanation": "Lower teacher effectiveness reduces the 'additional_learning' computed in `update_grades`, because it multiplies with 'study_hours'. This leads to lesser improvement in grades, thereby reducing the grades component in the success score calculation. Hence, a lower success score may be due to lower teacher effectiveness.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
