  "Problem": "provided above\",\n\nIf public health funding is increased, will economic spending necessarily decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing public health funding directly decreases health issues by reducing the impact of weather severity on health. Lower health issues then lead to reduced economic spending on healthcare and related services, assuming other variables remain constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
