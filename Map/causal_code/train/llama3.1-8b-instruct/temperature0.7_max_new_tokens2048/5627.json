  "Explanation": "From cause to effect without intervention - An increase in age leads to a change in the base heart rate calculation (from 70 to 80), and since the calculation for heart rate in people aged 50 or above factors in this higher base rate, the heart rate will increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
