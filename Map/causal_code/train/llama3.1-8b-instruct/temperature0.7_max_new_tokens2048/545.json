  "Problem": "def compute_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == '20OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == '10OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.1\n    return total - discount\",\n\nIf the list of items and their quantities increase, will the final payable amount increase without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, the total amount is calculated as the sum of the prices multiplied by the quantities of the items. Without intervention, increasing either the quantity or the price of the items will naturally lead to an increase in the total calculated amount before any discounts are applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
