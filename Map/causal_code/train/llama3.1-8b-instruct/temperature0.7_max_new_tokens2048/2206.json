  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    data['adjusted'] = data['original'] * 1.2 \n    if data['environment'] == 'urban': \n        data['final'] = data['adjusted'] + 20 \n    else: \n        data['final'] = data['adjusted'] - 10 \n    return data\",\n\nIf we observe a higher 'final' value upon manually setting the environment to urban, can we infer that the 'original' value was definitely raised?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the environment to urban itself causes an increase in the 'final' value due to the addition of 20 points. This increase can occur irrespective of the 'original' value, which means observing a higher 'final' value does not necessarily imply that the 'original' value was raised.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
