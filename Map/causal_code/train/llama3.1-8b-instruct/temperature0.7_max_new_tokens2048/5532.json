  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount, holiday):\n    if holiday:\n        discount += 0.1\n    final_price = base_price * (1 - discount)\n    tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate\n    total_cost = final_price + tax_amount\n    return total_cost\",\n\nIf there is a decrease observed in the 'final_price', can it be concluded that it was a holiday?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'final_price' could be caused by other factors, such as an increase in the 'discount' not related to a holiday or a decrease in the 'base_price'. The holiday is just one of the possible causes for decreasing the 'final_price'. We cannot conclusively determine the holiday occurrence solely based on 'final_price' decrease.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A decrease in holiday may lead to an increase in discount, which in turn may lead to a decrease in final_price."
