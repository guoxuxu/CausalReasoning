  "Explanation": "A total observed to be less than the sum of item prices after `calculate_total` implies a reduction, possibly from `apply_discount_code` method or the quantity discount in `calculate_total`. In this case, considering `SAVE20` was applied correctly, it can be deduced the discount code intervention was successful.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
