  "Explanation": "Setting 'customer_loyalty_status' to 'none' results in 'incremental_discount' being zero. This intervention directly affects the 'final_discount', which now equals only the 'base_discount' since 'incremental_discount' is eliminated, reducing the overall discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
