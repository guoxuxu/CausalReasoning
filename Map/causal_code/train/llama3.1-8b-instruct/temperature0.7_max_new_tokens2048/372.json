  "Explanation": "The output of noisy_data is based on random numerical additions; therefore, it is impossible to deduce precisely which seed was used just by observing noisy_data. Different seeds could produce similar random additions, leading to homogeneously indistinguishable outcomes. Here, understanding the effect backward to its random cause remains non-deterministic despite intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
