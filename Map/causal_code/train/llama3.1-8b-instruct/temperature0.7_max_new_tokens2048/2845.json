  "Explanation": "A smaller increase in the total after adding an item might suggest it is less expensive or due to other reasons but under a new policy that eliminates the 'onSale' discounts, similar increases would be observed regardless of items' previous 'onSale' status. The observed effect (lesser increase in total) cannot definitively suggest the cause (item was onSale) when intervention (policy change) eradicates the effect of 'onSale'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
