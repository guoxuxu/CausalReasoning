  "Explanation": "While rain() does indeed reduce the temperature provided humidity is above 70, an intervention lowering humidity below this threshold would prevent rain from triggering. Therefore, a decrease in temperature does not necessitate high initial humidity if we assume humidity was modified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
