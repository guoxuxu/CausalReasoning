  "Explanation": "If the `tax_bracket` changes from 'low' to 'high', it suggests that the `income` which initially qualified for the 'low' bracket (i.e., 30000 or less), must have increased above 30000. Although the exact initial income is unknown, we can infer that it was <= 30000 before an increase led to reclassification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
