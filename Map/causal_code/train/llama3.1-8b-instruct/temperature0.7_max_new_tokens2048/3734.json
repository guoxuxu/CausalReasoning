  "Explanation": "In the code, whether a promotion is active or not, increasing the quantity always leads to an increase in sales since `sales += quantity` in the non-promotional branch, and `sales += 1.2 * quantity` in the promotional branch. Thus, more quantity directly leads to more sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
