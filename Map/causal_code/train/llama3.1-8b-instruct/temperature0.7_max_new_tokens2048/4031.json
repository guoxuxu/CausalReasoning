  "Explanation": "Assuming other factors such as temperature and humidity remain constant, a decrease in the comfort index could be caused by the transition of 'isRainy' from false to true, based on the 'calculateComfortIndex' function. However, it's important to note that changes in temperature or humidity could also affect the comfort index, hence this is not a definitive conclusion.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
