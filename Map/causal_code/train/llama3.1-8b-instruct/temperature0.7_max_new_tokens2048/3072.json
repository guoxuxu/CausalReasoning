  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'user_activity' in data:\n        if data['user_activity'] > 100:\n            data['category'] = 'high'\n        else:\n            data['category'] = 'low'\n    else:\n        data['category'] = 'unknown'\n    return data\",\n\nIf we modify the code to set 'user_activity' to 50 whenever it is not present in the data, will this ensure 'category' is always 'low' or 'high'?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an intervention where 'user_activity' is set to a default value of 50 if it's missing ensures that 'user_activity' always exists. Given the conditional checks, this will result in 'category' being set to 'low' (since 50 is not greater than 100), thereby never resulting in 'unknown'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
