  "Explanation": "Activating the premium membership status gives the user a 5% discount on all their orders (price *= 0.95 regardless of the use of any discount codes). Therefore, intervening to modify membership status before calling the function indeed affects the final price outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
