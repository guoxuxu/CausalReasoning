  "Problem": "def calculate_cost(products, discount, tax): \n    total = 0 \n    for price in products: \n        total += price \n    if discount > 0: \n        total *= (1 - discount) \n    total *= (1 + tax) \n    return total\",\n\nAssuming there has been an intervention to limit the maximum 'total' cost, would that necessarily imply that 'discount' has increased?",
  "Explanation": "Capping the 'total' cost (effect) could result from multiple interventions. It could be due to an increase in 'discount' or a decrease in prices of 'products' or even a decrease in 'tax' rate. Without more specific information, this conclusion about the increase in 'discount' would be incorrect as the effect could be due to multiple causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
