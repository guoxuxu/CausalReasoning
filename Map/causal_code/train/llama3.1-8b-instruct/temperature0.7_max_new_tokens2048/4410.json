  "Explanation": "Even after intervention, a 'final_value' of -1 does not conclusively indicate small original values; it might suggest the intervention did not amplify the values sufficiently or the cumulative total was still not enough, possibly due to the nature of the values (e.g., presence of zeros or small numbers).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If data values are multiplied by 5, the result affects transformed_data, which in turn affects data_sum, leading to a determination of whether is_large, and ultimately influencing final_value. The original data values also directly contribute to data_sum."
