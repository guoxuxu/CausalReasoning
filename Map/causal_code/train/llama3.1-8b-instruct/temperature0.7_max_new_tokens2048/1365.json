  "Explanation": "Adding fertilizer increases the soil quality index and thus influences plant growth, but it doesn't alter the influence of sunlight hours on plant growth. The relationship sunlight hours have with plant growth remains unchanged, as it maintains its direct multiplier in the growth calculation formula, showing that causal effect remains consistent, even with this intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
