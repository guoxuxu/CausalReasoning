  "Explanation": "Following a successful coffee making after 'water_added' intervention indicates that the intervention addressed the previous shortage. It shows causality where the action of adding water resolved the issue, thus highlighting causality from effect (successful coffee) to cause (adding water as intervention).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
