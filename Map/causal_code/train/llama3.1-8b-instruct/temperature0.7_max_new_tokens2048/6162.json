  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    if flag:\n        result = [x * 2 for x in data]\n    else:\n        result = [x + 5 for x in data]\n    filtered_result = [x for x in result if x > 10]\n    return filtered_result\",\n\nIf 'filtered_result' contains only values greater than 20, does it always mean 'data' was altered to only contain values greater than 10 when flag is True?",
  "Explanation": "'filtered_result' having values greater than 20 can occur with smaller original values in 'data' multiplied by 2 if flag is True, or added by 5 if flag is False, without needing each to be greater than 10 initially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
