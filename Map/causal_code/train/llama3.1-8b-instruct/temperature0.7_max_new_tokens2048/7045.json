  "Explanation": "The increase in humidity above 70 changes the weather from CLEAR to CLOUDY. The weather state will not remain CLEAR as the condition for it to be CLEAR (humidity <= 70) is not met.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
