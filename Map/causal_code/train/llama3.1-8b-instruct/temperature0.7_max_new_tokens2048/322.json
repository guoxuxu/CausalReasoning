  "Problem": "class Calculator { constructor(initValue) { this.value = initValue; } add(x) { this.value += x; } subtract(x) { this.value -= x; } getValue() { return this.value; } } const calc = new Calculator(10); calc.add(5); calc.subtract(3); const output = calc.getValue();\",\n\nDid the initial value of the calculator determine the use of the 'add' method?",
  "Explanation": "The decision to use the 'add' method is independent of the initial value set in the constructor. The method's usage is part of the designed sequence of operations and doesn’t causally depend on the initial value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
