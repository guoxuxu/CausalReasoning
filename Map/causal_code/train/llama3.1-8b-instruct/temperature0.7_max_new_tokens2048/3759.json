  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'price' in data and 'quantity' in data: \n        revenue = data['price'] * data['quantity'] \n    else: \n        revenue = 0 \n    data['revenue'] = revenue \n    if revenue > 1000: \n        data['category'] = 'High' \n    else: \n        data['category'] = 'Low' \n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'revenue' key in the data dictionary is greater than 1000, does this imply that both 'price' and 'quantity' were provided and non-zero?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'revenue' is directly computed as the product of 'price' and 'quantity', and it can only be greater than 1000 if neither of these is zero, it implies both were provided and were sufficiently large to yield a 'revenue' over 1000.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
