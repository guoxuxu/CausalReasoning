  "Explanation": "The increase in immunity level could be due to a higher vaccination rate, a larger number of people, or both. Without additional information, a higher number of people alone does not necessarily imply a higher vaccination rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
