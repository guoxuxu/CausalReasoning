  "Problem": "`\nvar inputA = 10;\nvar inputB = 5;\nvar result = 0;\n\nfunction multiply(a, b) {\n  return a * b;\n}\n\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nfunction processInputs(a, b) {\n  var tempResult = multiply(a, b);\n  result = add(tempResult, a);\n  return result;\n}\n\nresult = processInputs(inputA, inputB);\nconsole.log(result);\n`,\n\nSuppose you modify the function processInputs to always add a constant value of 10 to inputA within the function. Will this change cause an increase in the final value of result?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the code to always add a constant value to inputA inside the processInputs function will increase both the product of the multiplication operation in multiply(a, b) – since inputA has an increased value – and the sum in the add function. Consequently, the modification leads directly to an increase in result.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
