  "Explanation": "Although increasing the base_price leads to an increase in final_price, the inverse is not necessarily true. An increase in final_price could also be the result of a change in tax_rate or due to initial calculations before any discounts are applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
