  "Problem": "def compute_health_index(age, weight, diet_quality, exercise_freq): \n\\tif age > 50 and diet_quality < 3: \n\\t\\thealth_index = weight * 0.8 \n\\telif exercise_freq > 4: \n\\t\\thealth_index = weight * 0.6 \n\\telse: \n\\t\\thealth_index = weight \n\\treturn health_index\",\n\nIf a health policy increases minimal exercise frequency requirements, how would this affect the health_index?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the minimal exercise frequency, assuming it shifts exercise_freq above 4 for more individuals, leads to more individuals having their health_index computed as weight * 0.6, typically resulting in a lower health index for heavier individuals, demonstrating a clear intervention effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
