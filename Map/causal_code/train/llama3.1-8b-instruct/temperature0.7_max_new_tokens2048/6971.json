  "Explanation": "An increase in revenue could be ascribed to multiple factors such as an increase in demand, an increase in price, or an increase in marketing spend, aside from the change in season. Without isolating the season as a variable or controlling other factors, one cannot definitively conclude that the change in season from winter to summer alone caused the increase in revenue.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
