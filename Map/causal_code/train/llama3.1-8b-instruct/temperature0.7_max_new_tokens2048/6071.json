It also includes a method to check if the user can rent a car, which depends solely on their driving license status.\"\n  },\n\nIf a user's age is changed to 20, will this enable them to successfully rent a car without changing any other information or logic in the code?",
  "Explanation": "In the existing logic, the method `canIssueDrivingLicense()` will return true for users of age 20, which then sets `hasDrivingLicense` to true. Consequently, the method `tryToRentCar()` will return true due to the user having a driving license. This is a direct causality from a cause (user age being 20) to an effect (ability to rent a car) without any external interference or additional modification.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
