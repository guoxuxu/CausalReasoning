  "Explanation": "Although calling 'turnOffEngine' sets 'speed' to 0, it's not possible to definitively conclude that 'turnOffEngine' was called just because 'speed' is 0. The vehicle might have never had the engine turned on in the first place, or the initial speed could have been 0 even if the engine was never turned on.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
