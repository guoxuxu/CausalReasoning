  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, membership_status, promo_code_active):\n    discount = 0\n    if membership_status:\n        discount += 10\n    if promo_code_active:\n        discount += 5\n    final_price = max(0, price - (price * discount / 100))\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf final_price is observed to increase, can we conclude that promo_code_active was deactivated?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in final_price could result from several factors such as a decrease in the discount rate due to deactivation of the promo code or loss of membership. However, it could also result from an increase in the base price, which could offset an unchanged or even an increased discount. Thus, an increase in final price alone does not definitively indicate that the promo_code was deactivated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
