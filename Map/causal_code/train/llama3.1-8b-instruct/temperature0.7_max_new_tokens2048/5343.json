  "Explanation": "The person's mood being 'good' is not solely determined by it being sunny. Although sunny weather means there is no traffic jam, the mood also depends on whether the person had coffee or not. Without coffee, even on a sunny day, the mood could be 'neutral'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
