  "Explanation": "By intentionally keeping the window closed (intervention) and detecting motion, the system is designed to trigger the alarm when motion is detected alone, as indicated by the second elif block in the trigger_alarm method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
