  "Explanation": "A 'mild' weather status is determined purely by the specific range of temperatures (between 10 and 30). While humidity could influence these conditions, it is not necessary for an intervention in humidity to have occurred for a 'mild' result, as this can also be due to a standard weather condition without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
