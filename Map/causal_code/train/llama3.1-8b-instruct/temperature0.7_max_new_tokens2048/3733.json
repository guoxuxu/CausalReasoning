  "Explanation": "Changing the growth level value manually does not change the internal logic and conditions required for the plant to grow, which includes being watered and exposed to sunlight. The prerequisites for growth remain unchanged regardless of the growth level.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
