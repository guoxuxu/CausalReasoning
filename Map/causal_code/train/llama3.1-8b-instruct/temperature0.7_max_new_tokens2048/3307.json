  "Explanation": "A positive customer response, signified by a high satisfaction level, can be triggered by a price under 80, which can occur irrespective of age being above or below 30, since adjustments based on income can result in prices less than 80 in both age groups.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
