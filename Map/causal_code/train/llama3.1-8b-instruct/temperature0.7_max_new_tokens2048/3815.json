  "Explanation": "The 'willItRain' function only returns true if the temperature is below 20 and it is stormy. Since it does not consider any other conditions for rain, if it is raining, we can determine that the temperature is indeed below 20 and it's stormy without requiring additional interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
