  "Explanation": "By setting x to 0.75 in 'apply_intervention' which returns '2 * x_value + 0.1 * np.random.randn(data_size)', and observing an increase, it implies a direct positive causal influence of 'x' on 'y', since we directly intervened by setting 'x_value' and observed the effect on 'y_intervened' without other dependencies influencing this specific relationship.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
