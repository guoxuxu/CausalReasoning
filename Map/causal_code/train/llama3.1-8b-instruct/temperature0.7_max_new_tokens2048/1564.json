  "Explanation": "An increase in inventory could be due to restocking after checking the stock, which is independent of whether an order was cancelled afterwards. The order cancellation has its separate influence by possibly reducing the inventory slightly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
