  "Explanation": "An increase in total payment could be caused not only by an increase in item prices but also by a decrease in the discount rate or an increase in quantities. Without specific information, we cannot confirm the cause definitively.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
