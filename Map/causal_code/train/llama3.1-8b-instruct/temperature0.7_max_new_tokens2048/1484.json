  "Problem": "int sales = 200; \nint advertising_expense = 50; \nif (advertising_expense > 40) {\n    sales += advertising_expense * 2;\n} else {\n    sales -= 10;\n}\nint customer_feedback = (sales / 10); \nif (customer_feedback > 30) {\n    advertising_expense += 20;\n}\",\n\nDoes a high customer feedback score indicate that previous sales were high?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, customer feedback is calculated as sales divided by 10. Thus, a high customer feedback directly indicates that sales must have been high as this metric solely depends on the value of sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
