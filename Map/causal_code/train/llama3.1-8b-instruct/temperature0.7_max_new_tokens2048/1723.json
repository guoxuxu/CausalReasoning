  "Explanation": "While an increase in temperature could be due to the heater being on, it could also result from external natural temperature rise or slower adjustment of room temperature towards a higher external temperature. Thus, it's not a direct inference.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
