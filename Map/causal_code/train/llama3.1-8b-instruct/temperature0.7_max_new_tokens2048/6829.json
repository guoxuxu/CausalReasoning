  "Problem": "def adjust_temperature(sensor, desired_temp):\n    current_temp = get_reading(sensor)\n    heater_on = False\n    if current_temp < desired_temp - 5:\n        heater_on = True\n        increase_temperature(desired_temp - current_temp)\n    elif current_temp > desired_temp + 5:\n        decrease_temperature(current_temp - desired_temp)\n    return heater_on\",\n\nIf the desired temperature is achieved, can we conclude that either 'increase_temperature' or 'decrease_temperature' was called?",
  "Explanation": "Reaching the desired temperature when there is a significant initial difference in temperature as per the coded logic implies that internal functions to adjust temperature, i.e., 'increase_temperature' or 'decrease_temperature', would have been involved. This manipulation likely intervened to correct the temperature discrepancy.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
