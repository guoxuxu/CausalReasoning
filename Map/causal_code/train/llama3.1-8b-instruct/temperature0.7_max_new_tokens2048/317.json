  "Explanation": "In the code, 'calculateTotal' computes the total tax based on the current 'salesAmount' and 'taxRate'. Increasing or decreasing 'taxRate' directly influences the tax amount, which in turn affects the total value returned by 'calculateTotal'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
