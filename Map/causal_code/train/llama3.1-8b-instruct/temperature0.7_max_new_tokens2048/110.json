  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, adjustment_factor, demand, supply):\n    if supply > demand:\n        adjustment_factor *= 0.9\n    else:\n        adjustment_factor *= 1.1\n    new_prices = {product: price * adjustment_factor for product, price in prices.items()}\n    return new_prices\",\n\nIf the adjustment_factor decreased, was it necessarily because the supply was greater than the demand?",
  "Explanation": "The only place in the code where the adjustment_factor is decreased (multiplied by 0.9) is within the 'if' condition 'supply > demand'. Thus, if we observe that the adjustment_factor has decreased, it necessarily indicates that the supply was greater than the demand at the time of computation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
