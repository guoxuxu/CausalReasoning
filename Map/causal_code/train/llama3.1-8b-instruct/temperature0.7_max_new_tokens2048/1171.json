  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    modified_data = data * 2 \n    final_data = modified_data + 100 \n    return final_data\n\nresult = process_data(50)\",\n\nIf 'final_data' is observed to be 200, can we infer that 'modified_data' was necessarily set to 100 due to an intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Observing 'final_data' at 200 does not necessarily confirm 'modified_data' was set to 100 through intervention. 'final_data' equaling 200 could result from the natural workings of the function or other possible alterations not specified. This conclusion presumes no other modifications affecting the output apart from the given intervention scenario, which is not exclusive.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
