  "Explanation": "The removal of high pollution as a stressor due to the intervention results in the removal of 'respiratory issues' from John's health. This, in turn, restores his energy partially (increases by 10), signifying a direct causal impact upon his energy if the intervention occurs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
