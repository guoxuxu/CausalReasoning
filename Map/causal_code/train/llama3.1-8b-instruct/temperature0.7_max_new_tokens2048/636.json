  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data and data['age'] > 18:\n        data['adult'] = True\n        if data['income'] > 50000:\n            data['tax_bracket'] = 'high'\n        else:\n            data['tax_bracket'] = 'low'\n    else:\n        data['adult'] = False\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'none'\n    return data\",\n\nGiven a 'tax_bracket' output of 'high', can we intervene to assess whether the input 'age' was definitely greater than 18?",
  "Explanation": "Seeing 'tax_bracket' set to 'high' requires both the 'adult' flag to be True and 'income' over 50000. Since 'adult' is True only if 'age' is over 18, this indirectly confirms that 'age' was greater than 18.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
