  "Problem": "def update_score(score, bonus, penalty): \n    new_score = score + bonus - penalty \n    return new_score \n\ninitial_score = 100 \nadditional_bonus = 20 \nextra_penalty = 5 \n\nfinal_score = update_score(initial_score, additional_bonus, extra_penalty)\",\n\nIf an intervention sets the penalty to zero, will the new score equal the sum of the initial score and the bonus?",
  "Explanation": "With a penalty of zero due to an intervention, the new score becomes simply the initial score added to the bonus, as there is no subtraction of the penalty.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
