  "Explanation": "Lowering the reorder threshold means that more units of a product must be sold before reaching it, potentially reducing frequency of restocking as it allows for more sales to occur before replenishing inventory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
