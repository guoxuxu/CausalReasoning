  "Explanation": "In the original code, the probability of raining decreases (from more than 0.3 to more than 0.7) as the temperature increases above 20 degrees, indicating lower probability of raining at higher temperatures.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
