  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  private boolean isRaining;\n  private int temperature;\n  public WeatherSimulator(boolean isRaining, int temperature) {\n    this.isRaining = isRaining;\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n  }\n  public void updateWeather(boolean newRainStatus, int newTemperature) {\n    if (newTemperature > 20 && !isRaining) {\n      newRainStatus = false;\n    }\n    this.isRaining = newRainStatus;\n    this.temperature = newTemperature;\n  }\n  public String getWeatherStatus() {\n    if (isRaining) {\n      return \"Rainy\";\n    } else if (temperature > 25) {\n      return \"Sunny\";\n    } else {\n      return \"Cloudy\";\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nHaving observed the weather status changing to 'Sunny', can we infer that the recent intervention was a temperature adjustment above 25 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "In this context, the only condition under which the 'Sunny' status would be returned by getWeatherStatus is if the temperature is exceeding 25. Hence an intervention causing a temperature rise above 25 is the most logical inference, especially if it wasn't raining.",
