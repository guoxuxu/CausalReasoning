  "Explanation": "Artificially doubling the virus spread rate does not imply causally that the number of confirmed cases or the average temperature has increased. Since this intervention is hypothetical and does not change the underlying variables ('covid_positive' or 'temperature'), there are no grounds to claim an increase in these variables from a manipulation in virus spread rate metric alone.",
