  "Explanation": "Only increasing humidity beyond 85% doesn't guarantee an increase in rain probability unless the temperature is also above 15°C. Without knowing the specific temperature, we cannot definitively claim that rain probability will increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
