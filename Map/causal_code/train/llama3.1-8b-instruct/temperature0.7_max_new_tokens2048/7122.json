  "Explanation": "While calling order_stock with a positive integer indeed increases the stock level, the stock_level might also be modified directly or potentially by other future methods in the code that are not displayed here. Thus, seeing an increase in stock_level does not definitively indicate that order_stock was called.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
