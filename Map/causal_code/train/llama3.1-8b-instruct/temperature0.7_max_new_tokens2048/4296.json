  "Problem": "{\n    \"code\": \"class ClimateControlSystem { \n    int temperature;\n    boolean airConditioningOn;\n\n    public void adjustTemperature(int desiredTemp) {\n        if(desiredTemp > 25) {\n            airConditioningOn = true;\n            temperature = desiredTemp - 5;\n        } else {\n            airConditioningOn = false;\n            temperature = desiredTemp + 2;\n        }\n    }\n}\",\n    \"language\": \"Java\"\n  },\n\nIf an external intervention modifies the temperature, does this determine the state of the air conditioning?",
  "Explanation": "In the provided method adjustTemperature, temperature setting changes are dependent on the condition if desired temp is greater than 25 or not, solely. External changes to the temperature won't automatically trigger or change the air conditioning state without executing adjustTemperature method with appropriate desiredTemp value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
