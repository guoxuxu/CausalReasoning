  "Problem": "int calculateInterest(int principal, int rate, int time) { int interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100; return interest; } int main() { int principal = 10000; int rate = 5; int time = 3; int interest = calculateInterest(principal, rate, time); int totalAmount = principal + interest; return totalAmount; }\",\n\nIf the principal amount increases, will the totalAmount also increase without any other changes to the code?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the principal directly increases the interest calculated, since interest is dependent on the principal. As a result, since totalAmount is the sum of principal and interest, it will also increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
