  "Problem": "class Store {\n  constructor() {\n    this.stock = {'apple': 20, 'banana': 30};\n    this.prices = {'apple': 1.0, 'banana': 0.5};\n  }\n\n  purchase(item, quantity) {\n    if(this.stock[item] >= quantity) {\n      this.stock[item] -= quantity;\n      return this.prices[item] * quantity;\n    }\n    return 0;\n  }\n\n  restock(item, quantity, price) {\n    if(item in this.stock) {\n      this.stock[item] += quantity;\n      if(price !== undefined) {\n        this.prices[item] = price;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the total price calculated in a purchase is different from previous calculations for the same quantity of an item, can it be concluded that the manager used the restock method to intervene and change the item's price?",
  "Explanation": "According to the provided code, the only way the price per item can change is via the restock method. Thus, if the total price for the same quantity changes, it indicates that the restock method was utilized to adjust the item's price.",
