  "Problem": "def update_status(temperature, rainfall):\n    if temperature > 30 and rainfall < 10:\n        status = 'drought'\n    elif temperature < 0 and rainfall > 50:\n        status = 'flood'\n    else:\n        status = 'normal'\n    return status\n\ndef send_alert(status):\n    if status == 'drought':\n        alert_sent = True\n    elif status == 'flood':\n        alert_sent = True\n    else:\n        alert_sent = False\n    return alert_sent\",\n\nIf the temperature is increased above 30 with a low rainfall, would the `status` definitely be 'drought'?",
  "Explanation": "The `update_status` function sets the status to 'drought' when the temperature exceeds 30 and the rainfall is less than 10. An increase in temperature above 30 with low rainfall fits these conditions, leading to the status being 'drought'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If temperature is increased, it can lead to low rainfall, which in turn can lead to 'drought' status, and a 'drought' status can trigger an alert."
