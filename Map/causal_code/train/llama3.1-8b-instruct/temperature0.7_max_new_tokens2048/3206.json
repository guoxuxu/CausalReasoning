  "Problem": "def calculateInterest(balance, rate): \n    if balance > 1000: \n        interest = balance * (rate / 100) \n    else: \n        interest = balance * (rate / 2 / 100) \n    return interest\",\n\nIf the balance increases, will the interest calculated also increase, assuming no other changes?",
  "Explanation": "In the given function, the interest is directly calculated based on the balance and rate. If the balance increases, the computed interest either grows proportionally (when balance > 1000) or at a lesser rate (when balance <= 1000) without other changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
