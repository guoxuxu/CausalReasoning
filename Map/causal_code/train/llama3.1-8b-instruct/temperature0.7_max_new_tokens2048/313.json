  "Problem": "def compute_scores(data):\n    average = sum(data)/len(data)\n    adjustments = [x * 0.1 for x in data]\n    corrected_scores = [x + adjust for x, adjust in zip(data, adjustments)]\n    return corrected_scores, average\n\nscores = [65, 70, 75, 80]\nadjusted_scores, mean_score = compute_scores(scores)\",\n\nIf the list 'scores' contains higher values, will the 'mean_score' also be higher?",
  "Explanation": "The 'mean_score' directly depends on the values in 'scores' since it is computed as the average of these values. Increasing the values in 'scores' increases their sum, thus increasing the calculated 'mean_score'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
