  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    mean = sum(data) / len(data)\n    adjusted_data = [x - mean for x in data]\n    final_data = [x**2 if x >= 0 else abs(x) for x in adjusted_data]\n    result = sum(final_data)\n    return result\",\n\nIf the 'data' list contains larger numbers, will the 'result' necessarily be larger?",
  "Explanation": "While increasing the numbers in 'data' increases the 'mean', the adjustment subtracted from each data point scales accordingly. This can potentially lead to smaller or similarly scaled 'adjusted_data', and because the transformation applied in 'final_data' includes squaring or taking the absolute value, this does not directly guarantee larger outcomes in 'result'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
