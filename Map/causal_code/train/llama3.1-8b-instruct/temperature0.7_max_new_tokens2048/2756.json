  "Problem": "def sales_forecast(hours_worked, ad_budget): \n  productivity = hours_worked * 0.5\n  ad_effectiveness = ad_budget * 0.3\n  total_sales = (productivity + ad_effectiveness) * 1000 \n  return total_sales\",\n\nIf we set a specific advertising budget, can we predict total sales from changes in hours worked?",
  "Explanation": "By setting a constant ad_budget, ad_effectiveness becomes constant. Changes in hours_worked will directly alter productivity, and since ad_effectiveness is constant, any variation in total_sales must come from the changes in productivity (caused by changes in hours worked).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
