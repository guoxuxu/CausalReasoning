  "Problem": "{\n    \"Code\": \"def calculate_discount(price, coupon_code):\n  if coupon_code == 'SUMMER20':\n    price *= 0.8\n  elif coupon_code == 'WINTER10':\n    price *= 0.9\n  return price\n\ndef purchase_item(item_price, has_coupon, time_of_year):\n  discount_code = ''\n  if has_coupon:\n    if time_of_year == 'Summer':\n      discount_code = 'SUMMER20'\n    elif time_of_year == 'Winter':\n      discount_code = 'WINTER10'\n  final_price = calculate_discount(item_price, discount_code)\n  return final_price\"\n  },\n\nWould setting has_coupon to False affect the final price even if it is initially Summer and the discount_code is 'SUMMER20'?",
  "Explanation": "Changing 'has_coupon' to False in the middle of the function execution does not alter the 'discount_code' already set based on the initial conditions in 'purchase_item'. Since the code 'SUMMER20' applies a 20% discount, the final price remains discounted irrespective of changes to 'has_coupon' status after the discount code assignment.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
