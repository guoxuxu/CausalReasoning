  "Explanation": "According to the `checkGrowthConditions()` method, plant growth occurs only when both conditions are met: the temperature is above 20 and the light is on. Therefore, observing plant growth implies that both conditions were true, including the temperature being above 20.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
