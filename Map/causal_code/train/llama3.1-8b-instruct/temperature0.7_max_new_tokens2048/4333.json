  "Explanation": "According to the code, Alice is graded based on her score using the 'assign_grade' method. A score of 85 falls within the range of 80-89, which corresponds to a grade of 'B'. There is a direct relationship between the score and the grade it translates to, without any external intervention affecting this outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
