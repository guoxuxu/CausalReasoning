  "Problem": "def update_inventory(product_sell, current_inventory): \n    if product_sell['product_id'] in current_inventory: \n        current_inventory[product_sell['product_id']] -= product_sell['quantity'] \n        if current_inventory[product_sell['product_id']] < 0: \n            current_inventory[product_sell['product_id']] = 0 \n    return current_inventory\",\n\nIf we modify the inventory update method to not check for negative values, will the inventory potentially end up with negative values when sales exceed the stock?",
  "Explanation": "Without the check for negative values (an intervention), the code simply decrements the current inventory by the 'quantity' sold, allowing it to potentially be negative.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
