  "Explanation": "The original initialization, which sets each teacher to have 30 students, remains unchanged. Changes due to intervention (like hiring more teachers for the same or reduced number of students, thereby affecting the ratio) do not affect how the original code structurally assigns students per teacher at initialization.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
