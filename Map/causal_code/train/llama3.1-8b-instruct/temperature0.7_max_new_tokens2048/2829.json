  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag): \n    result = [] \n    if flag: \n        for d in data: \n            if d % 2 == 0: \n                result.append(d ** 2) \n    else: \n        for d in data: \n            if d % 2 != 0: \n                result.append(d + 1) \n    return result\",\n\nIf we observe that all values in the output of 'process_data' are odd, can we conclude that 'data' initially had only odd integers?",
  "Explanation": "While the function does add 1 to each odd data point when 'flag' is False, resulting in odd output values, observing all odd values in the output does not exclusively indicate that the input had only odd integers, as even integers squared (from the scenario when 'flag' is True) might also generate odd values (e.g., 2^2 = 4; 4+1 = 5). Hence, an intervention or additional check to the presence of 'flag' and its effect on processing is needed to draw a precise conclusion.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
