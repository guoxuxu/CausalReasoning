  "Explanation": "Turning the heater on through an external script breaks the natural causality in the regulate_temperature function. The heater's state (on/off) no longer reliably informs us about the room's temperature in relation to the target temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
