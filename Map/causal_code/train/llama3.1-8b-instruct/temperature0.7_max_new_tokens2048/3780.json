  "Problem": "See above Python code\",\n\nIf an admin sets the content visibility to False, will it remain invisible regardless of view count?",
  "Explanation": "The admin_override method directly sets the visibility state, overriding any previous state or effects due to view_count changes in the update_visibility method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
