  "Problem": "class WeatherPredictor: \n    def __init__(self, temperature, humidity): \n        self.temperature = temperature \n        self.humidity = humidity\n\n    def predict_rain(self): \n        if self.humidity > 80 and self.temperature < 20: \n            return True \n        else: \n            return False\",\n\nIf the function predict_rain returns True, can we conclude that the temperature was definitely below 20?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the function predict_rain is designed to return True only if both conditions (humidity > 80 and temperature < 20) are met, if it returns True, both conditions must be satisfied. Therefore, the temperature must be below 20.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
