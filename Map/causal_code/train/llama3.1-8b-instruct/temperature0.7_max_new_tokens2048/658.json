  "Problem": "def analyze_temperatures(data): \n    avg_temp = sum(data) / len(data) \n    hot_days = [day for day in data if day > 30] \n    cold_days = [day for day in data if day < 10] \n    result = {'average': avg_temp, 'hot_days_count': len(hot_days), 'cold_days_count': len(cold_days)} \n    return result\",\n\nIf we replace all temperature values in 'data' to be above 30 degrees, will the 'cold_days_count' in the results become zero?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening to set all temperatures above 30 directly impacts the calculation of 'cold_days', effectively filtering out any days that could be considered cold. This manipulation of the original cause (data's temperatures) leads to a specific effect (cold days count) with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
