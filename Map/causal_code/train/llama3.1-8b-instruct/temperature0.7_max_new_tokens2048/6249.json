  "Problem": "Provided in the Description\",\n\nIf customer loyalty points are increased, would the final price always decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing customer loyalty points beyond certain thresholds (100 points) increases the loyalty_discount, leading directly to a decrease in the final price when other variables remain constant. This is a clear case of intervention affecting the cause (loyalty points) leading directly to an effect on the outcome (final price).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Increased customer loyalty points → Reduced final price; Reduced final price → Decreased customer spending; Decreased customer spending → Increased customer satisfaction; Increased customer satisfaction → Increased customer loyalty points",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing customer loyalty points causes a reduced final price, which in turn leads to decreased customer spending, resulting in increased customer satisfaction, which ultimately leads to increased customer loyalty points."
