  "Explanation": "Without overtime, 'total_pay' is directly proportional to 'hours_worked' as calculated from 'total_pay = hours_worked * rate_per_hour + bonus'. Increasing 'hours_worked' will linearly increase 'total_pay'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
