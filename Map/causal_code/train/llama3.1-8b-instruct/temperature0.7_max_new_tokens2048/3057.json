  "Explanation": "If the 'make_investment' method returns a failure (setting 'investment_success' to False), it means that the condition checking if funds are sufficient (funds >= investment_amount) was not met. This directly indicates that the funds were less than the investment amount prior to attempting the investment. This is a valid cause to effect inference with the method acting as an intervening mechanism.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
