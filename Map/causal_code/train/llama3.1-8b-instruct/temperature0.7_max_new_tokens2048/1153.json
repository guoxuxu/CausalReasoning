  "Explanation": "While improved health suggests adequate sunlight and water, it could also be significantly influenced by the addition of fertilizer. Thus, health alone does not definitively imply sufficient sunlight and water.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
