  "Explanation": "The `calculate_demand` function sets higher base demand for sunny weather (120) compared to rainy (80) without considering other variables like holiday or marketing campaign. Thus, changing the weather to rainy will reduce the base demand irrespective of any interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
