  "Explanation": "While increased exercise_frequency positively affects the health_index, stating the previous insufficiency only based on an increase is speculative without prior data on their exercise habits. Other factors like diet could have also been altered or were previously compensating.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
