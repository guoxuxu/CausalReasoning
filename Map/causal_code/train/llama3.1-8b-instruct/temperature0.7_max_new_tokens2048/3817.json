  "Explanation": "Stopping the storm and observing no rain does not reliably indicate that the temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius because the rain condition in 'willItRain' depends on both the storminess and the temperature being below 20. Without the storm, the lack of rain doesn't necessarily mean that the temperature wasn’t low enough.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
