  "Explanation": "Reducing the costs would increase the profit due to the formula `profit = revenue - costs`; however, this increase is independent from the execution path related to the marketing campaign. The campaign specifically affects the revenue, not the cost reduction, thus the profit increase due to cost cutting is from a different causal path in the code.",
