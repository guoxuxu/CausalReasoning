  "Explanation": "Increasing the price of items would indeed increase the sales value if the same quantity is sold, as the sales are calculated based on the quantity times the price of the item. Intervention by increasing item prices thus causes an increase in total sales value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
