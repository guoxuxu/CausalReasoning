  "Explanation": "Observing an increase in the size of 'processed_data' implies that the conditional inclusion criteria might have been broadened. Since a broader condition would allow more of the smaller values from 'data' to pass through (from original entries in 'data'), it suggests that the condition likely was adjusted to include smaller numbers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
