  "Explanation": "The intervention explicitly changes the causal structure so that 'cloudy' now also results in taking an umbrella. Thus, changing weather to 'cloudy' now has a direct effect on the decision to take an umbrella.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
