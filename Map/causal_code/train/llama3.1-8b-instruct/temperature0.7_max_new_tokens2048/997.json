  "Explanation": "A decrease in total_cost could result from either a decrease in the price or a decrease in the tax rate, or an increase in a Discount on a DiscountProduct instance. Without knowing which variable changed, we cannot directly infer that the decrease in total_cost was due to a decrease in price alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
