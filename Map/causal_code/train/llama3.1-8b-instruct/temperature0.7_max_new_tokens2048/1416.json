  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n    private int temperature;\n    private boolean isRaining;\n\n    public WeatherSimulator(int temperature) {\n        this.temperature = temperature;\n        this.isRaining = false;\n    }\n\n    public void updateWeather(int deltaTemp, boolean startRain) {\n        temperature += deltaTemp;\n        if (startRain && temperature < 20) {\n            isRaining = true;\n        } else {\n            isRaining = false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public boolean willItRain() {\n        return isRaining && temperature < 15;\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf it is observed that it is raining, can we infer that the temperature is currently below 15 degrees without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "While rain occurring does strongly suggest low temperature, it being below 15 degrees is only a possibility, not a certainty, as rain can start as long as the temperature is below 20 degrees. Hence, we cannot infer with certainty that the temperature must be below 15 degrees just from the rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
