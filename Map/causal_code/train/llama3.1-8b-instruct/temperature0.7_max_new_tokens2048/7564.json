  "Explanation": "The absence of snow suggests either the temperature is not below 0 or the humidity is not above 30, or both. Since the humidity was intervened to be set at 20, the humidity condition for snow is unmet. However, this scenario alone does not confirm the season change to summer as the lack of snow can result from various other non-seasonal factors or interventions affecting temperature or humidity.",
