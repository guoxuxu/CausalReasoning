  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, stock, discount_factor):\n    if discount_factor > 0.5:\n        discount = price * 0.10\n    else:\n        discount = price * discount_factor\n    final_price = price - discount\n    total_sales = final_price * stock\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf the discount_factor increases, will total_sales necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount_factor does not necessarily result in higher total_sales. If the discount_factor exceeds 0.5, the discount is capped at 10% of the price, limiting the final_price reduction and potentially the increase in total_sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
