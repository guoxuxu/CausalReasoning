  "Explanation": "Just increasing humidity won't necessarily cause a prediction of rain to change unless it surpasses 85 alongside a temperature below 20—as per the conditions in `willRainSoon` method. Simply increasing humidity does not guarantee the temperature condition for rain is met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
