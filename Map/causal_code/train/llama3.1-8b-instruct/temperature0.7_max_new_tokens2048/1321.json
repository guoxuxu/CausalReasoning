  "Problem": "class CommercialBuilding { int rent; int bill; bool popular_area; int num_tenant(int guests) { this.rent += 50; if(guests > 100 || popular_area) { bill += guests * 2; return guests; } else { return guests / 2; } } void adjust_rent_and_bill(bool economic_crisis) { if(economic_crisis) { rent -= 100; bill += 50; } else { rent += 100; bill -= 20; } }}\",\n\nIf we enforce an economic stimulus (intervention) causing elimination of an economic crisis, will this result in increased rent?",
  "Explanation": "The method 'adjust_rent_and_bill' specifies that in absence of an economic crisis (through intervention), rent increases by 100. Thus, effectively handling an economic crisis leads to a direct increase in rent.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
