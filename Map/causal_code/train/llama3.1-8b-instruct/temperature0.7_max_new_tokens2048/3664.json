  "Explanation": "By setting water levels to be consistently above 50, any increase in plant growth can then be attributed to the effective interaction of ample sunlight (>75) and soil quality, as suboptimal conditions in either would prevent the maximization of growth.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
