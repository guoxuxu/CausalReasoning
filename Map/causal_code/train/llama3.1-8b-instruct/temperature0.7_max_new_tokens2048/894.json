  "Problem": "def calculate_scores(temperature, adjustment): \n    if temperature > 20: \n        score = 70 \n        if adjustment: \n            score += 15 \n    else: \n        score = 50 \n        if adjustment: \n            score -= 10 \n    return score\",\n\nIf an intervention is made to always activate adjustment when temperature is greater than 20, will this effect the score when temperature is 25?",
  "Explanation": "When the adjustment is always activated at temperatures greater than 20, at a temperature of 25 the score, initially 70, would increase by an additional 15 due to the true condition of adjustment, resulting in a score of 85.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
