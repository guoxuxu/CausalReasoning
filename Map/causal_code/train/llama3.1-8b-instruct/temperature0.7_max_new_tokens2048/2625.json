  "Explanation": "An increased task count suggests that the system had been set to ready, but it doesn't necessarily mean it was 'manually' done; it could have been done by the `initializeSystem` function itself. Thus, this doesn't conclusively imply manual intervention without more context.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
