  "Explanation": "Even with an intervention allowing manual setting of rainy conditions, no rain does not definitively indicate that the temperature didn’t exceed 30 degrees. The weather could’ve been set to non-rainy manually irrespective of the temperature. Thus, the relation between temperature state and rain is not conclusively inverse under intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
