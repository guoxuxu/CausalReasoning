  "Problem": "def compute_final_score(base_score, bonus, penalty, is_new_user): \n  if is_new_user:\n    bonus *= 2\n  final_score = base_score + bonus - penalty\n  return final_score\",\n\nIf an intervention sets the 'is_new_user' to true, does the 'final_score' generally increase?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'is_new_user' to true doubles the 'bonus', which directly adds more to 'final_score' than it would otherwise (assuming all else remains constant). The intervention manipulates the causal chain by increasing an intermediary ('bonus'), thus generally increasing the 'final_score'. This is a cause-to-effect scenario with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
