  "Explanation": "Under the given code, traffic_flow being zero strictly occurs when signal_green is False (signal is red). Thus, a reduction in traffic_flow to zero confidently indicates the signal turned red without directly observing the signal status, as no other condition in the code reduces traffic_flow to zero.",
