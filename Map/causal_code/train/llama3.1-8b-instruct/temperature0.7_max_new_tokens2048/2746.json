  "Explanation": "Studying for more hours directly affects John's grades due to the `update_grades` function where grades are recalculated by adding additional learning. Higher grades improve the grade component in the success score calculation in `predict_success`, which leads to a higher overall success score.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
