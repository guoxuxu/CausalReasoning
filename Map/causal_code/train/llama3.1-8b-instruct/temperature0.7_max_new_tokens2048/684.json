  "Explanation": "The code shows that if supply increases while demand stays constant, price will decrease because price is determined by the ratio of supply to demand, as seen from the 'else' condition in calculate_price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
