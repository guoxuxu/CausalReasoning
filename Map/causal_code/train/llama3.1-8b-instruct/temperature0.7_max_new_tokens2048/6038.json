  "Explanation": "With x controlled at a constant value, an increase in t2 could result not only from an increase in y but also from already having t1 > 50, such that the conditional logic in the if block triggers adding more to t2 regardless of changes in y.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
