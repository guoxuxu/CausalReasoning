  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(prices, discounts, tax_rate): \n    discounted_prices = [p - (p * d) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)] \n    taxed_prices = [dp * (1 + tax_rate) for dp in discounted_prices] \n    total_sales = sum(taxed_prices) \n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf an intervention measures an increase in total_sales after decreasing the tax_rate, could this have been caused by increasing the discounts?",
  "Explanation": "While the decrease in the tax rate, by itself, tends to increase total sales by reducing the overall price, an increase in discounts can also contribute to the rise in total_sales. This depends on how the interplay between less tax and higher discounts affects the final taxed prices and the corresponding consumer response.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
