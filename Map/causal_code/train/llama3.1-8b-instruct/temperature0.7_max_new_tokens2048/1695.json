  "Problem": "class HealthReport { int calories; bool exercise; int stressLevel; void updateExercise(bool didExercise) { exercise = didExercise; if (didExercise) { calories -= 100; } } void updateStressLevel(int workHours) { if (workHours > 8) { stressLevel += 5; } else if (workHours < 5) { stressLevel -= 3; } } }\",\n\nIf the updateExercise method is called with 'true', will there necessarily be a decrease in calorie count?",
  "Explanation": "The method updateExercise modifies the exercise attribute and adjusts the calories based on the boolean input. If 'didExercise' is true, it explicitly decreases the calorie count by 100.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
