  "Explanation": "evaluateHealth returning false can be due to any one or more of the following reasons: insufficient sleep, inadequate water intake, or inappropriate calorie intake. It is incorrect to determine the specific cause (calorie intake in this case) from the effect (evaluateHealth result) without further intervention or information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
