  "Problem": "int process(int x, int y) {\n  int a = x + y;\n  int b = a * 2;\n  int c = b - 3;\n  if (c > 10) {\n    return b;\n  } else {\n    return a;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the output of the function increments after setting y to a constant and increasing x, can we be sure that the original values of x and y would always produce a lesser output?",
  "Explanation": "Setting y constant and increasing x could potentially shift the function's outcome from returning a to b (if the influence of the intervention causes c to exceed 10), which generally means a larger output value due to different computation (a = x + y, b = 2(x + y)). However, because the relationship and output depend heavily on whether c crosses 10, solely increasing x with fixed y does not guarantee that all smaller original x and y values would produce a lesser output, especially around the threshold where outputs switch from a to b.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
