  "Problem": "def compute_score(health, age, medication_status):\n    base_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_score -= (age - 50) * 0.75\n    if health < 5:\n        base_score -= (5 - health) * 20\n    if medication_status == True:\n        base_score += 20\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf observing a decreased `base_score`, can it be concluded that `health` has necessarily worsened?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in `base_score` can result from several factors in the code, not just a worsening in health. It could also be due to an increase in age over 50 or lack of medication. Therefore, observing a lower score does not directly imply that health has worsened, as the cause might be one of several other factors.",
