  "Explanation": "Intervening to help students manage stress can effectively reduce stress levels, but this reduction does not necessarily link back directly to the number of questions in a quiz. A reduced stress level could be due to the intervention's effectiveness, better coping mechanisms, or other factors, rather than solely the quiz format.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
