  "Explanation": "Setting the season to 'winter' actually applies a discount to the prices, which should lower the price of each item. However, because the total sales are also affected by the quantity of units sold, the decrease in unit price doesn't necessarily mean that total sales will decrease; sales might even increase if more units are sold due to the lower prices.",
