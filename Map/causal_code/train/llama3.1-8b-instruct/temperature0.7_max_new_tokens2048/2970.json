  "Explanation": "The budget directly affects the amounts allocated to both tv_ads and online_ads. Since ad_impressions is calculated based on these amounts, increasing the budget should result in more ad_impressions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
