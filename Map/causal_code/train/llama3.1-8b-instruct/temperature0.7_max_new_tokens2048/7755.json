  "Problem": "public class HealthApp { int dailySteps; boolean reachedGoal; public void updateSteps(int steps) { dailySteps += steps; if (dailySteps >= 10000) { reachedGoal = true; } else { reachedGoal = false; } } public boolean hasReachedGoal() { return reachedGoal; } public void resetSteps() { dailySteps = 0; reachedGoal = false; } }\",\n\nIf an external method sets dailySteps directly to 10000 and updateSteps(0) is then called, does reachedGoal become true?",
  "Explanation": "By setting dailySteps to 10000, calling updateSteps with 0 will check the condition dailySteps >= 10000, which is true, hence setting reachedGoal to true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
