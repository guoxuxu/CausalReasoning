  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'age' in data: \n        data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n    if 'income' in data and data['is_adult']:\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'high' if data['income'] > 50000 else 'low'\n    return data\",\n\nCan the presence of 'tax_bracket' data alone determine if 'is_adult' is True?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of 'tax_bracket' indicates both 'is_adult' and 'income' conditions were met (i.e., age must be at least 18 and income data must exist). However, without knowing the specific income and age values directly or indirectly inferring from other data fields, the fact that 'tax_bracket' exists does not solely determine that 'is_adult' is True directly; it’s implied but other missing data might influence this.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
