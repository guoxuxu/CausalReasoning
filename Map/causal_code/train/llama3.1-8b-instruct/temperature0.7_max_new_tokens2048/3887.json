  "Problem": "def product_sales(increase_advertising, current_sales):\n    increased_traffic = increase_advertising * 1.5\n    if increased_traffic > 100:\n        sales_jump = 20\n    else:\n        sales_jump = 5\n    new_sales = current_sales + sales_jump\n    return new_sales\",\n\nIf the sales jump was observed as 20, can we infer that the increase in advertising was sufficient to create traffic above 100?",
  "Explanation": "Given the way the conditional is set up, a sales jump of 20 would only occur if the increased traffic was above 100, which in turn could only happen if the advertising was increased by a certain amount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
