  "Explanation": "Although environmental pollution directly affects John's stress level by increasing it, the observation of high stress cannot confirm the increase in pollution because there are multiple factors contributing to stress, including noise level which is also influenced by traffic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
