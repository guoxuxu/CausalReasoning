  "Explanation": "While the state will be set to 'gas' if the temperature is above 100 degrees, the state might not always remain 'gas' if other interventions occur. For example, an increase in pressure can change other properties like compressibility or density but does not affect the state directly determined by temperature in this code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
