  "Problem": "ClimateControl class managing a climate system.\",\n\nDoes observing a specific indoor temperature directly indicate a specific user setting?",
  "Explanation": "While the `set_user_settings` allows for custom temperature settings, indoor temperature can also adjust based on weather changes without direct user interventions. Therefore, observing a specific temperature isn't solely indicative of a specific user setting.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
