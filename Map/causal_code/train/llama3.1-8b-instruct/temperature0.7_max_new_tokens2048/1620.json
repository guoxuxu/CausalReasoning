  "Explanation": "While clear weather is a necessary condition for daily operations success in the 'daily_operations' method, the method's success also depends on light traffic. Therefore, successful operation could also occur on a clear day with light traffic, not clear weather alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
