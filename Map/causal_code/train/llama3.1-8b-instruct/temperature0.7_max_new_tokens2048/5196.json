  "Problem": "def compute_total_cost(price, num_items, tax_rate, discount, apply_discount):\n    if apply_discount:\n        total = (price * num_items) * (1 - discount)\n    else:\n        total = price * num_items\n    return total * (1 + tax_rate)\",\n\nIf the 'total' cost calculated is higher, does it necessarily mean the 'price' per item was higher?",
  "Explanation": "A higher 'total' could be caused by several factors other than a higher 'price' per item; it could also be due to more items being purchased ('num_items'), a higher tax rate ('tax_rate'), or changes in the discounting ('discount' and 'apply_discount').",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
