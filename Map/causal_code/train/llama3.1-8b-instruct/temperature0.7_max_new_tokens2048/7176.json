  "Problem": "def calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, bonus_percentage):\n    taxes = gross_salary * tax_rate\n    bonus = gross_salary * bonus_percentage\n    net_salary = gross_salary - taxes + bonus\n    return net_salary\",\n\nIf we manipulate the net salary by changing taxation rules, can we infer changes in the gross salary?",
  "Explanation": "Manipulating net salary by altering tax rules only provides information about the dependence of net salary on tax rates under the conditions of that intervention. It does not provide direct information about gross salary since multiple configurations of gross salary, tax rate, and bonus percentage can lead to the same net salary.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
