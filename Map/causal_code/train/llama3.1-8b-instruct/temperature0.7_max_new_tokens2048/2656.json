  "Problem": "def analyze_purchases(user, products, preference_threshold):\n    total_spent = 0\n    preferred_products = []\n    for product in products:\n        if product['price'] > preference_threshold:\n            user['budget'] -= product['price']\n            total_spent += product['price']\n            if product['category'] in user['preferences']:\n                preferred_products.append(product)\n    return total_spent, preferred_products\",\n\nIf we modify the code to ignore user's budget limitations while buying, will this change lead to an increase in preferred_products being bought?",
  "Explanation": "Ignoring the user's budget limitations allows them to purchase more (or potentially all) products that meet their preferences and price criteria, regardless of total cost, likely increasing the number of preferred products purchased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
