  "Problem": "See above\",\n\nIf the calculated average is significantly large, does this indicate that the code now excludes extremely low values through a new computational step?",
  "Explanation": "A high average by itself doesn't confirm the introduction of a new computational step for excluding low values; it could simply mean the dataset primarily contains higher numbers, or the threshold set excludes lower values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "New computational step → Exclusion of extremely low values; Exclusion of extremely low values → Significantly large calculated average; Significantly large calculated average → Code excludes extremely low values"
