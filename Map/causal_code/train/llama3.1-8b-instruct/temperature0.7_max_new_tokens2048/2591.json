  "Problem": "class WeatherController {\n public void controlWeather(boolean cloudy, boolean raining) {\n  if (cloudy) {\n    activateCloudSystem();\n    if (raining) {\n      activateRainSystem();\n    }\n  } else {\n    deactivateCloudSystem();\n  }\n }\n private void activateCloudSystem() { System.out.println('Cloud system activated.'); }\n private void deactivateCloudSystem() { System.out.println('Cloud system deactivated.'); }\n private void activateRainSystem() { System.out.println('Rain system activated.'); }\n}\",\n\nIf it is cloudy, will the cloud system be activated?",
  "Explanation": "The `controlWeather` method checks if 'cloudy' is true and then calls `activateCloudSystem`. There is no intervention involved; the activation is directly caused by the condition being true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
