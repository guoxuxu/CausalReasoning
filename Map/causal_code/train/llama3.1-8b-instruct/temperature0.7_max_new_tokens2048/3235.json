  "Explanation": "A 'failed' status occurs both when there is an 'error' key in the input data and when a ValueError exception occurs due to the inability to cast the 'value' field to an integer. Therefore, seeing a 'failed' status does not definitively indicate a ValueError occurred; it could be simply due to the presence of an 'error' in the data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
