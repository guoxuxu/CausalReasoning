  "Explanation": "An increase in predator population occurs if plant growth is more than 30 units. This can happen not only when the weather is sunny (20 units plant growth, which is not enough alone), but also in rainy conditions (50 units, sufficient for increase). Weather being windy (10 units) won't directly cause enough plant growth unless accumulated from previous growths, or other unaccounted factors affect this.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
