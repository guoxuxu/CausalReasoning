  "Explanation": "The alert can be set to True either if the temperature is above 30 or if the humidity is above 70. Therefore, an alert being True does not definitively indicate that the temperature was the cause, as high humidity could also have triggered the alert.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
