  "Explanation": "In the code, calculate_tax() returns the product of base_price and tax_rate. Thus, modifying the base_price directly impacts the outcome of calculate_tax(), reflecting a causal relationship from cause (base_price) to effect (tax calculation).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
