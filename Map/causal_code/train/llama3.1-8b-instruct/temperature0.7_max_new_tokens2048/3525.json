  "Explanation": "A renewal decision could be influenced by either the final cost being below 100, which could be achieved with various discount rates depending on the base price or if the 'trend_factor' is above 5, irrespective of the discount applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
