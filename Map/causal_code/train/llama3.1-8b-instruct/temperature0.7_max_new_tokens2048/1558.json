  "Explanation": "While the reduction in risk scores could be due to successful anti-smoking campaigns, it could also be influenced by changes in other factors such as age or BMI improvements. Without isolating the effect, we cannot conclusively attribute the reduction to changes in smoking habits alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
