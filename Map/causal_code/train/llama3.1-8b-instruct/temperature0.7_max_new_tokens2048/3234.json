  "Explanation": "The code attempts to cast the 'value' field to an integer and multiply it by 2 under the 'status' of 'success'. If this casting fails, a ValueError is raised, and the except block sets the 'status' to 'failed'. Since this happens after the initial check for an 'error' in the data, any ValueError in this step directly leads to a 'failed' status without further intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
