  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n   modified_data = data.copy()\n   modified_data['temperature'] += 10\n   if modified_data['temperature'] > 30:\n       modified_data['status'] = 'high'\n   else:\n       modified_data['status'] = 'normal'\n   return modified_data\",\n\nIf the desired final 'status' of 'modified_data' is to be forced into 'normal', could decreasing the initial temperature in the data induce this change?",
  "Explanation": "To ensure the 'status' is 'normal', the temperature needs to be adjusted to be 30 or below after processing. Thus, if the original temperature is set below or equal to 20 (which becomes at most 30 after adding 10), the 'status' will consequently be set to 'normal' as specified in the else block of the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
