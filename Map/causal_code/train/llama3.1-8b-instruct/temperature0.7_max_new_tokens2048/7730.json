  "Problem": "class Car:\n    def __init__(self, model, year):\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n        self.speed = 0\n\n    def accelerate(self, increment):\n        self.speed += increment\n        if self.speed > 120:\n            self.speed = 120\n\n    def brake(self, decrement):\n        self.speed -= decrement\n        if self.speed < 0:\n            self.speed = 0\",\n\nIf we call the accelerate method, will the car's speed always exceed 120?",
  "Explanation": "The accelerate method includes a check to ensure that the car's speed does not exceed 120. Whenever the speed reaches or exceeds 120, it is set to 120. Therefore, calling the accelerate method does not guarantee that the speed will always exceed 120, but it will ensure that it does not.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
