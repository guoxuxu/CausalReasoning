  "Problem": "def calculate_health(running, diet_quality, hours_of_sleep):\n    fitness = running * 0.3 + diet_quality * 0.5\n    health_score = fitness * 2 + hours_of_sleep * 0.8\n    return health_score\n\nhealth = calculate_health(running=3, diet_quality=8, hours_of_sleep=7)\",\n\nGiven a decrease in `health_score`, if we hold `diet_quality` constant, does this imply that either `running` or `hours_of_sleep` has decreased?",
  "Explanation": "Since `diet_quality` is held constant, the only other factors that can cause a decrease in `health_score` are decreases in `running` or `hours_of_sleep`. Since both these factors directly contribute to the determination of `health_score`, a reduction in either while keeping `diet_quality` constant must be the cause of the decrease in `health_score`.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
