  "Explanation": "For rain to occur, clouds must first form, which happens if the humidity is above 80% and the temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, rain only falls when clouds are present and the temperature is below 15 degrees Celsius.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
