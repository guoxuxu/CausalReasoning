  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'stock_threshold' while keeping the 'current_stock' constant will lower the difference between these two values, making it more probable that 'current_stock' is less than the 'stock_threshold'. Hence, 'restock_check' would likely return True.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
