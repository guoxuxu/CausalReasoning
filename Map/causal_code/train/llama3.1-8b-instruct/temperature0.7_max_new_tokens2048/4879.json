  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'error' in data:\n        data = correct_errors(data)\n    cleaned_data = clean_data(data)\n    processed_data = analyze_data(cleaned_data)\n    return processed_data\n\ndef correct_errors(data):\n    return data.replace('error', 'corrected')\n\ndef clean_data(data):\n    return data.strip()\n\ndef analyze_data(data):\n    if len(data) > 50:\n        return 'Data is too large'\n    else:\n        return 'Data processed successfully'\",\n\nIf the function 'correct_errors' is modified to not fully correct certain error types, will 'process_data' fail to return successfully processed results?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function 'correct_errors' is directly responsible for fixing errors before further data processing in 'process_data', a failure to properly fix errors will affect the later stages of data cleaning and analysis, causing 'process_data' to possibly fail in turning out successfully processed data. This is a case of inferring the effects of a change in the cause without intervention elsewhere.",
