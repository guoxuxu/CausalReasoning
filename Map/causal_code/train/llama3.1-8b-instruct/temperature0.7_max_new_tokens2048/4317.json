  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand, advertisement_expense, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        season_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        season_factor = 0.8\n    base_sales = price * demand * season_factor\n    if advertisement_expense > 1000:\n        return base_sales * 1.1\n    else:\n        return base_sales\",\n\nIf the price increases, will sales increase without changing any other variables?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, increasing price would intuitively seem to increase sales (base_sales = price * demand * season_factor), yet the relationship between price and demand is typically inversely related: as price increases, demand generally decreases unless explicitly modelled otherwise. Since this dependency isn't stated, the increase in price, while keeping demand constant, is unrealistic, therefore not supporting direct cause to effect without other influences.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
