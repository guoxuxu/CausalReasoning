  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    mean = sum(data) / len(data)\n    adjusted_data = [x - mean for x in data]\n    final_data = [x**2 if x >= 0 else abs(x) for x in adjusted_data]\n    result = sum(final_data)\n    return result\",\n\nIf we adjust the code to scale down the 'data' before calculating the 'mean', will the 'result' systematically change?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling down 'data' before calculating 'mean' reduces both the calculated 'mean' and the magnitude of 'data' points. Since 'adjusted_data' becomes smaller, the final squares or absolute values in 'final_data' are likely reduced, which will usually decrease 'result'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
