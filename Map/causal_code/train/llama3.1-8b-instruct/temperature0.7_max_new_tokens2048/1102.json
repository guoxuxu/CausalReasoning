  "Explanation": "The 'marketing_efficiency' is labelled 'Low' if the advertising spending exceeds 10% of the total sales. Thus, if 'marketing_efficiency' is 'Low', it reflects a high advertising expense relative to sales, indicating a direct relationship.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
