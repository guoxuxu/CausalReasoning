  "Explanation": "Observing an increase in 'y_intervened' does indicate the product of the intervention on 'x' and the coefficient (2 in this case) led to a positive number. However, it does not distinctly reveal if the change was because the intervened value was positive, as the noise component (0.1 * np.random.randn(data_size)) could also push the results to exhibit positive values even if the intervened 'x' were non-positive.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
