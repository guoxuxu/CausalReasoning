  "Problem": "class Car {\n    constructor(gasTank, engineHealth) {\n        this.gasTank = gasTank;\n        this.engineHealth = engineHealth;\n        this.isRunning = false;\n    }\n    startEngine() {\n        if (this.gasTank > 0 && this.engineHealth > 50) {\n            this.isRunning = true;\n        }\n    }\n    drive() {\n        if (this.isRunning) {\n            this.gasTank -= 10;\n            this.engineHealth -= 5;\n        }\n    }\n    refuel(gas) {\n        this.gasTank += gas;\n    }\n    repair() {\n        this.engineHealth = 100;\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf the car is driving, does it mean the engine was healthy before starting?",
  "Explanation": "For the car to drive, it must be running, which only happens if the engine is healthy above 50 and there is enough gas. Therefore, driving implies that the engine was healthy at the start.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
