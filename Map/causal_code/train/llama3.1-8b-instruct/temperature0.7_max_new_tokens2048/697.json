  "Explanation": "An increase in temperature could occur from calling `activate_heating`, which internally calls `adjust_temperature`. Therefore, the temperature increase doesn't directly reveal that `adjust_temperature` was specifically and directly executed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
