  "Problem": "public class WeatherSimulator { int temperature; boolean isRaining; public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean rain) { this.temperature = temp; this.isRaining = rain; } public void updateWeather(int newTemp, boolean newRain) { this.temperature = newTemp; this.isRaining = newRain; } public boolean isCold() { return this.temperature < 50; } public boolean willRainSoon() { return this.isRaining && this.temperature < 60; } }\",\n\nIf the temperature is set to 40 but no rain status is updated, will the method isCold() return true?",
  "Explanation": "The method isCold() checks if the temperature is less than 50. Setting the temperature to 40 meets this condition, hence it returns true irrespective of the rain status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
