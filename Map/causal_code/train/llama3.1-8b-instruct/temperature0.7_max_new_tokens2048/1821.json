  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  private boolean isRaining;\n  private int temperature;\n  public WeatherSimulator(int temperature, boolean isRaining) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.isRaining = isRaining;\n  }\n  public void adjustWeather(int newTemp) {\n    if (newTemp < 0) {\n        this.isRaining = false;\n    }\n    this.temperature = newTemp;\n  }\n  public boolean checkUmbrellaNeed() {\n    return isRaining && temperature <= 20;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf it is raining, is it likely that a person will need an umbrella?",
  "Explanation": "The method checkUmbrellaNeed checks if it is raining and if the temperature is 20 degrees or below. Under these conditions, it returns true indicating a need for an umbrella. Since no explicit mention of temperature's exact value when it's raining is made, we answer based on the available conditional logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
