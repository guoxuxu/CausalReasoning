  "Explanation": "While administering medication improves healthScore for a smoker and people over 50, there is no information on whether the healthScore might not also improve due to other unrelated interventions or recovery factors in the real scenario. The code specifically targets smokers and elderly, but an increase doesn't tell us definitively that the person belongs to these groups without additional information.",
