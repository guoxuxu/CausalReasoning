  "Explanation": "An increase in 'd' could result from several factors due to the dependencies in the function: an increase in 'a' or 'b', or a favorable change in 'x' (e.g., a larger positive value). Without specific information on 'b' and 'x', one cannot conclusively deduce that an increase in 'a' is the sole or direct cause for the increase in 'd'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
