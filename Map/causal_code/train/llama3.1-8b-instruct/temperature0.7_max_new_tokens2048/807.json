  "Problem": "def compute_sales_data(prices, discounts, tax_rate):\n    final_prices = [(p - p * d) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)]\n    tax_amounts = [fp * tax_rate for fp in final_prices]\n    total_sales = sum([fp + ta for fp, ta in zip(final_prices, tax_amounts)])\n    return total_sales\",\n\nAssuming a policy change that has increased tax rates, if we see an increase in total sales, can we conclude that an increase in prices or a reduction in discounts caused this?",
  "Explanation": "While an increase in tax rates typically adds to the cost burden on consumers, which might suppress sales, an observed increase in total sales despite higher taxes does not straightforwardly imply that prices were increased or discounts were reduced. The increase could also stem from a higher volume of sales, changes in consumer preferences, or other promotional activities not captured in the price or discount alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
