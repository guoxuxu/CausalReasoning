  "Problem": "def calculate_co2_emissions(vehicle_type, miles_driven, fuel_efficiency):\n    if vehicle_type == 'electric':\n        emissions = 0\n    else:\n        emissions = miles_driven * (1 / fuel_efficiency) * 20\n    return emissions\",\n\nIf you increase 'miles_driven', will 'emissions' increase for a gasoline vehicle?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, for non-electric vehicles, emissions are calculated as a product of 'miles_driven', the inverse of 'fuel_efficiency', and 20. Thus, increasing 'miles_driven' increases the 'emissions' linearly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
