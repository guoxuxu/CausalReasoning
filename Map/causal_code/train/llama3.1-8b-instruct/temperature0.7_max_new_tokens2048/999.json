  "Explanation": "The discounted_cost is calculated by subtracting the discount from the base cost. If the discounted_cost is zero, it can only mean that the discount was exactly equal to, or exceeded, the base cost. This is a definitive inference based on how discounted_cost is computed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
