  "Explanation": "Given that the sales and restock amounts for 'apple' remain constant, an increase in the final inventory for 'apple' would likely indicate a higher initial quantity. However, without isolation from other variables, this alone might not be definitively conclusive.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
