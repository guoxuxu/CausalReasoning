  "Explanation": "The introduction of a vaccine reduces the number of infected individuals by a factor of the vaccine's efficiency (reduction = self.infected * efficiency), which directly decreases the pool of infectious subjects faster than if no vaccine was introduced, assuming the vaccine has a non-zero efficiency.",
