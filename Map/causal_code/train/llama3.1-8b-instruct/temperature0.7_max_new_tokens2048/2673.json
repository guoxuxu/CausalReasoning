  "Explanation": "Observing a decrease in temperature following the threshold adjustment suggests that the new threshold is probably lower, causing external temperatures, which would have had no effect before, to now trigger the cooling mechanism.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
