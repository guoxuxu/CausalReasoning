  "Problem": "A=5; B=10; C=A+B; D=C*2; if B > 5: E=D+10 else: E=D-5\",\n\nDoes an increase in E necessarily imply an increase in B?",
  "Explanation": "E depends on both D and the condition on B. However, B's affect on E is mediated through C and then D. E increases if D reaches or crosses a threshold while B influences if additional sum (10 or subtract 5) but doesn't solely define the increase in E.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
