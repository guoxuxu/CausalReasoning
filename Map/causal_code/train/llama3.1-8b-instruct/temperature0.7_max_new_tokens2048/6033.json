  "Problem": "class EventSimulator { int eventCount; double healthLevel; boolean isActive; EventSimulator() { eventCount = 0; healthLevel = 100.0; isActive = true; } void triggerEvent() { if (isActive) { eventCount++; healthLevel -= 10.0; } } void reset() { eventCount = 0; healthLevel = 100.0; isActive = true; } void deactivate() { isActive = false; } }\",\n\nIf we manually deactivate the simulator and then trigger an event, will healthLevel still decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Upon calling deactivate(), the isActive flag is set to false. When triggerEvent() is called thereafter, the condition if(isActive) fails. As a result, even though an event attempt occurs (triggering), healthLevel does not decrease because the event's effect is inactivated by the isActive flag being false.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Deactivating the simulator causes it to be inactive, which prevents event triggers from decreasing the health level."
