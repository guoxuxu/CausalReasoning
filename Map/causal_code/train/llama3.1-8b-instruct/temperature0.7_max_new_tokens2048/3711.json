  "Explanation": "An increase in 'adjusted_profit' could result from either an increase in 'revenue', a decrease in 'costs', or a change in 'city' from 'New York' to another city. Without additional information on 'costs' or 'city', 'revenue' alone cannot be determined as the sole cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
