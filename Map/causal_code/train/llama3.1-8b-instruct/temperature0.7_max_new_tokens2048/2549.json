  "Explanation": "Bypassing the 'clean_data' function and passing data directly to 'analyze_data' removes any data manipulation typically handled by 'clean_data'. Since the dataset already conforms to the age condition enforced by 'clean_data', its rules don't affect the outcome, meaning 'analyze_data' operates on the dataset exactly as received.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
