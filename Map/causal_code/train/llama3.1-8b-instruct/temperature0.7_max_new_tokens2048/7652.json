  "Problem": "...\",\n\nIf predators are manually decreased, can we establish if herbivores will increase without observing plant growth?",
  "Explanation": "Decreasing predators does not directly affect herbivores; it removes a predator threat but does not ensure adequate food resources for herbivore growth. Herbivore populations are directly linked to plant availability, which wasn't observed or manipulated directly in this scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the predator population is manually decreased, it will lead to an increase in the herbivore population, which will then lead to an increase in plant growth, and subsequently, an increase in the herbivore population."
