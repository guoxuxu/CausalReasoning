  "Explanation": "Modifying the base_score computation to a constant means that hours studied will no longer influence the score calculation, thus making the number of hours studied irrelevant to the final score.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
