  "Explanation": "When 'increaseHeat' is invoked with the source 'solar', the code specifically increases humidity by 10 units, indicating a direct causal effect from the 'source' being 'solar' to humidity increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
