  "Explanation": "The function sets 'category' to 'minor' if 'is_adult' is False or if 'is_adult' does not exist (e.g., when 'age' key is missing). Hence a 'minor' category does not necessarily mean the 'age' must be under 18.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
