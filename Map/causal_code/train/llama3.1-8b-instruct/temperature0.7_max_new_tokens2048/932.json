  "Explanation": "According to the increaseTemperature method, when the temperature rises above 30 degrees, isRaining is set to true, indicating that it will indeed start raining when the temperature increases significantly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
