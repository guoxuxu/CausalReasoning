  "Explanation": "A 'High Risk' output in health_status can be caused by either being a smoker, age over 50 or both. Without knowing the age, one cannot definitively conclude the smoking status solely based on the health risk category. So, causality from effect to cause is uncertain without additional details on age.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
