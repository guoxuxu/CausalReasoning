  "Explanation": "Assuming no other interventions or changes to the speed, the function traffic_influence clearly adds 10 to the vehicle speed (which starts at 50) when the weather is sunny, making the vehicle speed 60.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
