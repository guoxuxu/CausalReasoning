  "Problem": "class HealthSystem { constructor(age) { this.age = age; this.healthStatus = 'healthy'; } updateHealthStatus(newStatus) { this.healthStatus = newStatus; } updateAge(newAge) { this.age = newAge if (this.age > 50) { this.updateHealthStatus('at risk'); } } } const person = new HealthSystem(30); person.updateAge(55); console.log(person.healthStatus);\",\n\nAssuming an administrative action that can modify any person's age regardless of current age, would setting a person's age to 51 cause their health status to change to 'at risk'?",
  "Explanation": "The updateAge method in the HealthSystem checks if the age is greater than 50 to set the healthStatus to 'at risk'. Therefore, administratively changing the age to 51 would trigger this condition and change the health status according to the code logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
