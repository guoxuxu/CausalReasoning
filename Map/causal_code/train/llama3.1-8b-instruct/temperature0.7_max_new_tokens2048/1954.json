  "Explanation": "If `heater_on` is true, based on the code logic, the only condition under which this happens is if `temp_outside` is less than `desired_temp` when `adjust_temperature` method is called.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
