  "Explanation": "Given how the code is structured, 'bonus_sales' being set to 100 directly results from the discount_factor being greater than 0.5. The value of 'bonus_sales' in this context is causally dependent on the value of discount_factor, causally indicating it surpassed 0.5.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
