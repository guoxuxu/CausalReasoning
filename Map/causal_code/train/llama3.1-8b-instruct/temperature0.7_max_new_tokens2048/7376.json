  "Problem": "def update_status(temperature, rainfall):\n    if temperature > 30 and rainfall < 10:\n        status = 'drought'\n    elif temperature < 0 and rainfall > 50:\n        status = 'flood'\n    else:\n        status = 'normal'\n    return status\n\ndef send_alert(status):\n    if status == 'drought':\n        alert_sent = True\n    elif status == 'flood':\n        alert_sent = True\n    else:\n        alert_sent = False\n    return alert_sent\",\n\nAssuming an alert was sent and then rainfall readings were manipulated to show increases, can we infer that the original status was definitely not 'normal'?",
  "Explanation": "The manipulation of rainfall readings post the alert being sent does not impact the original status determination by `update_status` function. Since the alert was sent, the initial status must have been either 'drought' or 'flood' as alerts are not sent for the 'normal' status. Thus, the original status was definitely not 'normal'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
