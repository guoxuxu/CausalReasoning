  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount percentage directly reduces each product's price by a greater margin, as per the formula in `apply_discount`. If the percentage is raised, the final price after discount of each product will indeed be lower.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
