  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_threshold):\n    filtered_data = [d for d in data if d > filter_threshold]\n    added_value = sum(filtered_data) + 10\n    return added_value\n\nresult = process_data([3, 15, 7, 22, 5], 10)\",\n\nIf the filter_threshold is increased, will the result of the process_data function necessarily decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the filter_threshold will reduce the number of items in the filtered_data list because fewer data points will exceed the higher threshold. Since added_value relies on the sum of filtered_data, a reduction in the number or size of elements in filtered_data reduces the sum, leading to a decrease in added_value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing filter_threshold causes a decrease in filtered_data, which in turn causes added_value to decrease."
