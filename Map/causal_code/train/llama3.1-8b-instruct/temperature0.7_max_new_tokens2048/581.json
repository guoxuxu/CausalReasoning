  "Problem": "class WeatherSystem {\n    int windSpeed = 10;\n    int airPressure = 100;\n    boolean isRaining = false;\n\n    void updateWeather(int newWindSpeed, int newAirPressure) {\n        windSpeed = newWindSpeed;\n        airPressure = newAirPressure;\n        if (windSpeed > 15 && airPressure < 95) {\n            isRaining = true;\n        } else {\n            isRaining = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf the wind speed increases beyond 15 without changing air pressure, will it rain?",
  "Explanation": "For it to rain, both conditions need to be met according to the original code: wind speed must be greater than 15 and air pressure must be less than 95. Simply increasing wind speed without reducing air pressure does not satisfy both conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
