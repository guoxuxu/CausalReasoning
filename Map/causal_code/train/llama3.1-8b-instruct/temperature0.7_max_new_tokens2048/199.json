  "Explanation": "Assuming all other variables are constant, improving the diet quality of a person over 50 years old, who historically had a 'Moderate' health risk due to a poor diet, will transition the health risk rating from 'Moderate' to 'Low' by improving one risk factor addressed in the decision conditions of the health_status function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
