  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, increment, should_update): \n    if should_update: \n        for i in range(len(prices)): \n            prices[i] += increment \n    return prices\",\n\nIf `should_update` is set to True, will the prices always increase?",
  "Explanation": "The code increments each element in the `prices` list by the `increment` when `should_update` is True. Thus, assuming positive increments, the prices will always increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
