  "Explanation": "A discrepancy in the expected total price could suggest that how the discounts were applied might be different from the norm. This might be due to changes in the discount rate or errors in applying them.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
