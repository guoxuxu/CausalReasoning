  "Explanation": "The absence of notification can equally be due to an intervention like disabling the print feature in notify_customers, not necessarily indicating that 'Sprocket' was absent from the list.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
