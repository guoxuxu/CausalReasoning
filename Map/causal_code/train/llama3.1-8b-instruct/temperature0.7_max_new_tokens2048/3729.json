  "Explanation": "Additional investments affect only the net profit after the computation of gross profit. Gross profit is calculated purely from sales and cost of goods sold, independent of how additional investments are treated. Therefore, changes in additional investments do not imply changes in gross profit.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
