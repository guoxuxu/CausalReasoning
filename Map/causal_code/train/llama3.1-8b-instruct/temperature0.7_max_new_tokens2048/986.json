  "Problem": "public class MotionSensor { private boolean isActive; private int detectedMovements; public MotionSensor() { isActive = false; detectedMovements = 0; } public void activate() { isActive = true; } public void deactivate() { isActive = false; } public void detectMovement() { if (isActive) { detectedMovements++; } } public boolean isAlarmTriggered() { return isActive && detectedMovements > 5; } }\",\n\nIf the function 'activate' is called, will the alarm eventually be triggered with subsequent movements?",
  "Explanation": "By activating the sensor using 'activate()', the sensor begins to detect and count movements. If sufficient movements (more than five) are detected, the alarm is triggered. The activation directly allows the sensor to record movements and eventually trigger the alarm if the threshold is exceeded.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
