  "Explanation": "A reduction in final prices from tax rate intervention only reflects changes in the tax component and does not necessarily imply any alteration in base prices. Other elements like membership discounts still influence the final total independently of the base price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
