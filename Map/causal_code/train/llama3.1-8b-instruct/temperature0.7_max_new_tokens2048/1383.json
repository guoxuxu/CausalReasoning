  "Problem": "def process_orders(order_data):\n    total_items = sum([order['quantity'] for order in order_data])\n    if total_items > 50:\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0\n    total_cost = sum([order['quantity'] * order['price'] * (1 - discount) for order in order_data])\n    return total_cost\",\n\nIf a new order comes in with a higher quantity than usual, will it increase the total cost calculated by the function?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the order quantity increases total_items. If total_items remains below or equals 50, the discount stays at 0, and thus, increases the total_cost since more items remain at full price. If it crosses 50, the discount kicks in, which might change the scenario depending on the price points of the items, but typically, given the similar order settings, total cost should still increase, only at a reduced rate due to the discount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
