  "Explanation": "From the code logic, raining is set to true only when 'hour' exceeds 11, during the updateWeather method's last condition block.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
