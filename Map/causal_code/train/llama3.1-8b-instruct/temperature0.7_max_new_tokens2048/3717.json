  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'age' in data: \n        data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n    if 'income' in data and data['is_adult']:\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'high' if data['income'] > 50000 else 'low'\n    return data\",\n\nCan changing the value of 'tax_bracket' to 'low' in the code indirectly determine a change in the 'age' field?",
  "Explanation": "Changing 'tax_bracket' to 'low' can be due to either the income being less than or equal to 50000 or 'is_adult' being False. However, since the 'tax_bracket' field does not impact the 'age' field directly or determine it indirectly, its modification cannot be used to infer or alter 'age'. The change in 'tax_bracket' does not causally affect 'age'; it only reflects conditions that could be attributed to other fields ('income' or 'is_adult').",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
