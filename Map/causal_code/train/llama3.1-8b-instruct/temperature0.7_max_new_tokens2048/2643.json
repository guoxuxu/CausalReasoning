  "Problem": "def compute_score(age, system_upgrade, error_count):\n    bonus = 10 if age > 2 else 5\n    if system_upgrade:\n        bonus += 5\n    score = 100 - error_count + bonus\n    return score\",\n\nIf you observe an increase in 'score', can it be inferred that 'error_count' definitely decreased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in 'score' could result from decreased 'error_count', an increase in 'age' crossing the bonus threshold, or the effect of a system upgrade. Thus, no certain inference about 'error_count' can be made without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
