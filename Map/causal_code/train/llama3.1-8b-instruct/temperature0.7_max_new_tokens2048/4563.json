  "Problem": "def update_inventory(store, item, quantity, operation):\n    if operation == 'add':\n        store[item] = store.get(item, 0) + quantity\n    elif operation == 'remove':\n        if item in store:\n            store[item] -= quantity\n            if store[item] <= 0:\n                del store[item]\n        else:\n            print('Item not found')\",\n\nIf the quantity of an item in the store increases, can we say that the 'add' operation was performed?",
  "Explanation": "While an increase in quantity often results from an 'add' operation, there could be other reasons such as updating the store object directly outside the function or adding the quantity through a different operation mistakenly not accounted for in the provided code. Hence, one cannot definitively say the add operation caused the increase without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
