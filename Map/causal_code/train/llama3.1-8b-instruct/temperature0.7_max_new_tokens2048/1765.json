  "Problem": "def compute_discount(price, is_member, discount_rate):\n    if is_member:\n        discount = price * discount_rate\n    else:\n        discount = 0\n    final_price = price - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nCan we confirm that someone is a member if we observe that no discount has been applied to their purchase?",
  "Explanation": "The absence of a discount (`discount = 0`) does not necessarily mean that the person is not a member; it could also imply that a member has a `discount_rate` of 0%. Thus, without intervention, we cannot definitively reverse infer membership status solely by observing no discount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
