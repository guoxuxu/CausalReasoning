  "Explanation": "When temperature is set directly, it bypasses the adjust_temperature method's conditional check that would normally increase rainfall when the temperature exceeds 30 degrees. Hence, rainfall does not increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
