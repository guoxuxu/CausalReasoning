  "Explanation": "After the intervention where the heating is forced to stay off irrespective of temperature readings, observing the heating to be on cannot be logically attributed to low temperatures, since our intervention ignores temperature conditions. This suggests another cause (possibly an error or override somewhere) is making the heating turn on.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
