  "Explanation": "Seeing a 'moderate' weather status could mean the initial scenario had a humidity not far above 70% with a temperature not above 30 degrees. Increasing humidity above 80% does not provide information about the initial state of temperature; the temperature could be low or slightly below 30. The causal path from humidity to temperature is not determined just from an increase in humidity and observing 'moderate' status.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
