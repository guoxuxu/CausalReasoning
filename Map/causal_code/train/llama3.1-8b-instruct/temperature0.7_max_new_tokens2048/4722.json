  "Explanation": "The rain starting cannot directly imply a temperature set below 0 from the method 'changeWeather', as the rain condition in 'changeWeather' triggers only when the temperature is above 30, not below 0. When the temperature is below 0, the code specifically sets 'isRaining' to false, indicating it would snow instead.",
