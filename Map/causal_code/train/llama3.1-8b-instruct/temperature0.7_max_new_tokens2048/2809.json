  "Explanation": "Low output from the add method after updating the values does not provide conclusive evidence regarding the original product's value, as the original values of a or b might have been such that they provided a high product with different addition results (e.g., higher a, lower b). This illustrates that an intervention adjusted values without offering information on the original state, thus preventing a reliable inference from effect to cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
