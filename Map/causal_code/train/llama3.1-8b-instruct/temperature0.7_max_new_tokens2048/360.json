  "Explanation": "Setting the day to clear modifies the temperature independent of its prior state. A temperature change following this manual intervention only confirms execution of the method's functionality, not the previous weather condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
