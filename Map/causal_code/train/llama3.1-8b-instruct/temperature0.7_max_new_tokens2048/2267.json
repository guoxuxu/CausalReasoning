  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { double temperature; boolean isRaining; WeatherSimulator(boolean rain, double temp) { isRaining = rain; temperature = temp; } void updateWeather() { if (temperature < 0) { isRaining = false; } temperature -= isRaining ? 5 : 10; } boolean willItRainTomorrow() { return temperature > 3 && !isRaining; } }\",\n\nIf the temperature is initially 10 degrees Celsius and it is not raining, will decreasing the temperature to 5 degrees cause it to rain?",
  "Explanation": "In the given code, rain depends directly on the temperature being above 3 degrees Celsius and it currently not raining ('willItRainTomorrow' method). Simply lowering the temperature from 10 degrees to 5 degrees, without other interventions, does not violate these conditions nor trigger any mechanistic change in the 'isRaining' status since the 'updateWeather' method does not make it start raining if it was not already.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
