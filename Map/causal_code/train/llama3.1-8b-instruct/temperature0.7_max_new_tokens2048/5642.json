  "Explanation": "Although a significant increase in final_sales suggests a strong influence from advertising_impact, without knowing the specific starting point of initial_sales, we cannot conclusively deduce whether it was significantly boosted due to being very low or moderately increased despite being high. Both scenarios could produce similar final_sales, implying the need for more specific data or an intervention to distinguish between these cases.",
