  "Explanation": "While a bad diet increases the health risk, a high risk value could also result entirely or in part from low exercise, which adds 1.5 to the risk factor. Hence, a high health risk does not unequivocally indicate a bad diet.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
