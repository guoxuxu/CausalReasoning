  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, stock, replenish):\n    for item, sold in sales.items():\n        if item in stock:\n            stock[item] -= sold\n            if stock[item] < 5:\n                if item in replenish:\n                    stock[item] += replenish[item]\n    return stock\",\n\nIf the final stock for a specific item is significantly higher than its initial stock, can we infer there have been adjustments through the replenish dictionary?",
  "Explanation": "A significant increase in final stock compared to initial can typically only occur through replenishment as sales generally reduce stock. Thus, a higher ending stock suggests intervention in replenishment, confirming the effect (higher stock) through a cause (replenishment intervention).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
