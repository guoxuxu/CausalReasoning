  "Problem": "TrafficControlSystem class definition with methods to manage traffic based on car and pedestrian densities.\",\n\nIf the traffic light is Green, can we infer the car traffic density is between 11 and 50?",
  "Explanation": "The only condition under which the traffic_light is set to 'Green' is when the car_traffic_density is between 11 and 50 inclusive.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
