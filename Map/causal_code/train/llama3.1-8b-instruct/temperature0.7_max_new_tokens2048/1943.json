  "Explanation": "Changing the plan affects outcome in the `activity` function. With an 'indoor' plan, the activity could be different such as 'visiting a museum' even without a raincoat, thus limiting the dependency of the activity on the specific outfit like raincoat.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
