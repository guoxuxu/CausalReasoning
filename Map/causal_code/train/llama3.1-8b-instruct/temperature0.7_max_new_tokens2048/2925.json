  "Explanation": "When the action is fixed to 'multiply', a higher final score implies that the scaling factor, delta, was higher. Since multiplication scales the initial scores by the delta value, observing a higher resulting score would suggest a higher delta was applied, assuming no other interventions in the scores.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
