  "Explanation": "Customer satisfaction can change depending on both the price and the quality of the product. Reducing price alone (cause) does not assure maintaining the same level of customer satisfaction (effect) if the initial product conditions differ.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
