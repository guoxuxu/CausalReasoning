  "Explanation": "The outcome of the status report purely depends on the temperature sensor and the logic within `adjust_heating`. Manually changing the status of the heating does not affect the internal decision-making process in `adjust_heating`, which relies on the value of `current_temperature` propositioned by `temperature_sensor`.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
