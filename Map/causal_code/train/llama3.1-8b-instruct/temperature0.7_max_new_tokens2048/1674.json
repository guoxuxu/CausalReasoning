  "Explanation": "An averaged increase in 'final_result' doesn't necessarily imply that the increment for even numbers was increased. It could result from the initial distribution of 'data_list' containing higher or differently spaced numbers, or a combination of even and odd handling in the unaltered process. Specific knowledge or observation of the modification to the function is necessary to confirm such a change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
