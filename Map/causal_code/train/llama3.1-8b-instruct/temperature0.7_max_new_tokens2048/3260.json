  "Explanation": "Setting `exercisesRegularly` to true and then updating the diet to 'healthy' will make both `hasHealthyDiet` and `exercisesRegularly` true. As per the logic in `updateHealthStatus()`, this combination guarantees an 'excellent' healthStatus.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
