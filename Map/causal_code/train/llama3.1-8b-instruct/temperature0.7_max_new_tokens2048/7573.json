  "Problem": "def compute_scores(data):\n  age_weight = 0.3\n  score_weight = 0.7\n  age_score = data['age'] * age_weight\n  test_score = data['test_score'] * score_weight\n  final_score = age_score + test_score\n  return final_score\",\n\nIf the 'age_weight' increases, will the 'final_score' increase for a candidate older than 30 with a constant test score?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'age_weight' raises the contribution of the 'age_score' component to the 'final_score', assuming the candidate's age and test score remain constant. Since the candidate is over 30, the higher 'age_weight' amplifies this segment of the score, hence increasing the 'final_score'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
