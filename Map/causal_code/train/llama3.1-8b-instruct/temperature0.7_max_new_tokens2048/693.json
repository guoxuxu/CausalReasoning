  "Problem": "class Employee { constructor(name, performanceRating, salary) { this.name = name; this.performanceRating = performanceRating; this.salary = salary; } updateSalary(percentIncrease) { this.salary += this.salary * percentIncrease / 100; } } const john = new Employee('John Doe', 85, 50000); function reviewPerformance(employee) { let newRating; if (employee.performanceRating > 80) { newRating = employee.performanceRating + 5; employee.updateSalary(10); } else { newRating = employee.performanceRating + 2; } employee.performanceRating = Math.min(newRating, 100); } reviewPerformance(john);\",\n\nCan a change in John's salary indicate a change in his performance rating without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "In this particular setup, a salary increase is conditional on John's performance rating being above 80, and it increases by a specific rate (10%) only when this condition is met. Therefore, an increase in salary is a direct indicator that John's performance rating was high enough to trigger this adjustment.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
