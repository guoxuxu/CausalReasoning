  "Explanation": "Without a reset, modifying the initial value of 10 twice would result in 40 (10*2*2). The only way to achieve a final value of 30 with two modifications is if a reset intervened with a new starting value that would produce 30 when modified twice.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
