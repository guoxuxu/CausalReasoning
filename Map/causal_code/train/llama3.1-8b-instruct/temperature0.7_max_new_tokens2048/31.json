  "Explanation": "From cause to effect with intervention - The intervention uniformly reduces the base risk to 0.1 regardless of age. Given this, the additional risk applied due to symptoms is the same (0.3) in both age groups, resulting in equal total risk.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
