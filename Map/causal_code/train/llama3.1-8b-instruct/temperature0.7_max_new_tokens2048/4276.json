  "Problem": "def process_data(data, switch): \n  if switch: \n    data = [x * 2 for x in data] \n  else: \n    data = [x / 2 for x in data] \n  result = sum(data) \n  if result > 50: \n    status = 'high' \n  else: \n    status = 'low' \n  return status, result\",\n\nIf an external adjustment sets all items in 'data' to be above 25, and 'switch' is set to True, will the 'status' invariably be 'high'?",
  "Explanation": "With all data items adjusted to above 25 and the 'switch' set to True, multiplying each item by 2 results in all data items being at least 50, leading to a 'result' that sums beyond 50, inevitably setting the 'status' to 'high'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
