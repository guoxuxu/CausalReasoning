  "Problem": "def update_scores(scores, action, delta):\n    if action == 'add':\n        for i in range(len(scores)):\n            scores[i] += delta\n    elif action == 'multiply':\n        for i in range(len(scores)):\n            scores[i] *= delta\n    return scores\n\nscores_list = [10, 20, 30]\nupdate_scores(scores_list, 'add', 5)\nupdate_scores(scores_list, 'multiply', 2)\",\n\nIf the initial values of scores_list were increased, would the final values of scores_list also increase without any change in the actions performed?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the initial scores in `scores_list` would lead to higher final scores after the same sequence of 'add' and 'multiply' actions because both actions are dependent on the current values of scores. The 'add' action increases each score directly, and the 'multiply' action scales it, making the output directly proportional to the input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
