  "Explanation": "Increased advertising will always result in higher sales as shown in the `calculate_sales` function where sales is computed with `0.5 * advertising` added to the weather-based sales figure. As a result, any increase in advertising budget, regardless of weather, will increase total sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
