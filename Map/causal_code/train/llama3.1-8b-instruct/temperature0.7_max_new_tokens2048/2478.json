  "Explanation": "If health status improves following an anti-smoking campaign intervention, it implicitly indicates the person was a smoker, as the direct act of stopping smoking (intervention) impacts only smokers in reducing their risk scores according to the 'risk_factor' method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
