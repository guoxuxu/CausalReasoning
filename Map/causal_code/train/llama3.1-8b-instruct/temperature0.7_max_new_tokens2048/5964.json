  "Explanation": "The method 'weatherStatus' returns 'Snowing' only if 'isRaining' is true and 'temperature' is below 32 degrees. Therefore, the report of 'Snowing' directly implies that these conditions were met without needing any additional information or intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
