  "Explanation": "When the `heater_override` is set to True, the `heater_on` status is forced to True irrespective of the actual temperature. As a result, the code explicitly increases the `temperature` by 3 (`self.temperature += 3`), leading to a guaranteed rise in `temperature` due to the heater being on.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
