  "Explanation": "Being classified as high risk does suggest they might meet the criteria of being over 50 and smoking; however, the code doesn't exclude potential future updates or changes where additional conditions might also set patient.highRisk to true. Therefore, while currently true, it's not a definitive backward conclusion without additional assumptions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
