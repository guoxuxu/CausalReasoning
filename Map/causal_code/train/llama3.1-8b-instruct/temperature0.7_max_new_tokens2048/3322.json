  "Explanation": "The method 'updateWeather' adjusts the temperature by the 'deltaTemp' parameter. If 'deltaTemp' is not zero, then the temperature will change from its initial state of 20 degrees. The lack of rain only ensures that the temperature does not set to 5 under rainy and cold conditions, but other changes through 'deltaTemp' affect the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
