  "Explanation": "The sales outcomes directly depend on the income levels since the base purchase likelihood values are assigned according to income groups in the CUSTOMER_BASE dictionary. Without any marketing intervention, these base values are the only factors influencing the purchase decisions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
