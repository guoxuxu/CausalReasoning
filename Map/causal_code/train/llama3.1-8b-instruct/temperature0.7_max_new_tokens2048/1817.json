  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private float temperature; private boolean raining; public void setTemperature(float temp) { temperature = temp; if (temp < 32) { raining = false; } } public boolean isRaining() { return raining; } public void startRain() { if (temperature > 50) { raining = true; } } }\",\n\nIf the temperature is set to 31 degrees Fahrenheit, will it begin to rain?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 31 degrees ensures it is below 32 degrees. According to the code, if the temperature is below 32 degrees, raining is set to false; thus, it does not start raining.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
