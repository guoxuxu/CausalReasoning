  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(prices, discounts, region):\n    base_prices = [p - (p * d / 100) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)]\n    if region == 'East':\n        tax = 0.07\n    elif region == 'West':\n        tax = 0.09\n    else:\n        tax = 0.05\n    final_prices = [bp * (1 + tax) for bp in base_prices]\n    average_price = sum(final_prices) / len(final_prices)\n    return average_price\",\n\nIf the region is forcibly changed to 'East', would the 'average_price' typically increase compared to being in 'West'?",
  "Explanation": "Although the tax rate in 'East' (7%) is lower than in 'West' (9%), which could imply lower final prices, changing the region does not necessarily mean the average price will be typically higher or lower without knowing the baseline prices and discounts. The change in tax can have a lowering effect on the final prices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
