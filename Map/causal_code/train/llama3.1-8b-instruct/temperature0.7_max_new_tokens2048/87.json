  "Explanation": "Setting 'restocked_units' to zero simplifies the function to 'new_inventory = current_inventory - sold_units'. Any increase in 'units_sold' now directly reduces 'new_inventory', as no units are being added to counterbalance the sales. This is an instance of observing causation from the change in the cause to the effect with an intervention (setting restock to zero).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
