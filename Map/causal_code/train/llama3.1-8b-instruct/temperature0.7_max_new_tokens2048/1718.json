  "Explanation": "Increase in temperature could be due to it not raining on the current day, and not specifically because it did not rain yesterday. The temperature change is tied to current weather conditions rather than extending causally from conditions of the previous day.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
