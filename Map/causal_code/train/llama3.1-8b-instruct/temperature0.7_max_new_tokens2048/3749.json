  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data:\n        data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n    if 'income' in data and data.get('is_adult'):\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'high' if data['income'] > 50000 else 'low'\n    return data\",\n\nIf we observe that the tax bracket is 'low', can we intervene and determine that making any individual under 18 would change the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "Changing an individual's age to under 18 would set 'is_adult' to False (assuming 'age' affects the 'is_adult' status in a typical scenario), which would skip the tax bracket calculation altogether. Therefore, making someone under 18 will not transition 'low' to 'high' tax bracket but rather remove the individual from the tax computation context,. This demonstrates that specific interventions (making someone underage) not only might not reverse the effect but also cease the relevant causal chain operation (tax bracket assessment).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
