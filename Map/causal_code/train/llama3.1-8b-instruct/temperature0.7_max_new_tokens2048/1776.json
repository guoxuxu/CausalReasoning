  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulation { private int humidity; private int temperature; public WeatherSimulation(int initialHumidity, int initialTemperature) { this.humidity = initialHumidity; this.temperature = initialTemperature; } public void increaseHumidity(int increment) { this.humidity += increment; if (this.humidity > 90) { this.temperature += 2; } } public int getHumidity() { return humidity; } public int getTemperature() { return temperature; } public void heatUp(int increment) { this.temperature += increment; if (this.temperature > 30) { this.humidity += 5; } } }\",\n\nDoes manually adjusting humidity using the increaseHumidity method guarantee a change in observed temperature?",
  "Explanation": "The method 'increaseHumidity' includes a condition that if the humidity exceeds 90, the temperature will be increased by 2. Therefore, manual intervention by drastically increasing humidity to above 90 guarantees an increase in temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
