  "Explanation": "Given the model's logic in predict_sales(), observing an increase in sales without other interventions implies that the external factor must be above 5, as only then would sales hit 50% of inventory levels.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
