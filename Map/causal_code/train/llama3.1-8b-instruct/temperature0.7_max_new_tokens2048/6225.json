  "Problem": "def compute_salary(base_salary, days_worked, bonus, tax_rate):\n    salary_without_tax = base_salary * days_worked / 30\n    if bonus:\n        salary_without_tax += 500\n    tax = salary_without_tax * tax_rate\n    net_salary = salary_without_tax - tax\n    return net_salary\",\n\nIf the government introduces a tax subsidy that effectively lowers the tax_rate, would this intervention lead to an increase in net_salary?",
  "Explanation": "The `net_salary` calculation involves the subtraction of `tax` from `salary_without_tax`. A lower `tax_rate` due to the tax subsidy reduces the `tax` amount (calculated as `salary_without_tax` * `tax_rate`), thereby increasing the resulting `net_salary`. This shows a straightforward positive impact of a tax rate reduction (intervention) on the net salary.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
