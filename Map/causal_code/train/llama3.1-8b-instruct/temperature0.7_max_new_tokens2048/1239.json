  "Explanation": "Modifying the profit_multiplier affects only the final computation of profit from revenue. It does not provide direct information about pricing strategy or how prices were set, as these components are upstream in the causal chain and unaffected by changes in the profit_multiplier.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
