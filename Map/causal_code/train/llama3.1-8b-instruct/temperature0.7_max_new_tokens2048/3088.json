  "Explanation": "The code explicitly decreases blood pressure by 10 units if medication is taken, irrespective of the stress level. Thus, administering medication leads to a direct intervention that lowers blood pressure.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
