  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting the discount to a fixed percentage (20%) irrespective of the season, the variability in discount introduced by the seasonal variation is removed, making the discount consistent. Thus, given a constant product price, the final price would also remain consistent across all seasons.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
