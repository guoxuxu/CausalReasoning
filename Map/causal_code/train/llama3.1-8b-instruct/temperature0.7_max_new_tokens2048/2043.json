  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(principal, rate, years):\n    if principal < 0 or rate <= 0 or years <= 0:\n        return 'Invalid input'\n    interest = principal * (rate / 100) * years\n    total_amount = principal + interest\n    return total_amount\n\namount = 1000\ndeposit_rate = 5\ninvestment_period = 10\nfinal_amount = calculate_interest(amount, deposit_rate, investment_period)\",\n\nIf we enforce a new policy to increase the 'deposit_rate', will the 'final_amount' necessarily be bigger than before for the same 'investment_period' and 'amount'?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'deposit_rate' through a policy change directly affects the 'interest' calculation in the function 'calculate_interest'. Since 'interest' is part of the formula to compute 'final_amount', its increase due to a higher 'deposit_rate' will yield a higher 'final_amount' given that other factors ('investment_period' and 'amount') remain constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
