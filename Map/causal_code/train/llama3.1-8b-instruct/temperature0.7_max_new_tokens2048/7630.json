  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'price' in data and 'discount' in data:\n        data['final_price'] = data['price'] - (data['price'] * data['discount'])\n        if data['final_price'] > 100:\n            data['shipping_cost'] = 10\n        else:\n            data['shipping_cost'] = 5\n    return data\",\n\nIf the shipping cost changes, can this indicate a change in the final price?",
  "Explanation": "A change in the shipping cost implies a change in the range of the final price. If the shipping cost is less or more, it indicates crossing the threshold of final price being greater than or equal to 100 units.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
