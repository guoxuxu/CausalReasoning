  "Explanation": "The store's rating could increase due to either an improvement in product quality, customer service, or both. The observed increase in rating alone does not conclusively pinpoint the cause without additional information about product quality and customer service.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
