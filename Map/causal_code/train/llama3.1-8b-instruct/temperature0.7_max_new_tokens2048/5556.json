  "Explanation": "While the 'decrease' action does reduce the input (by dividing it by 1.5), setting action to 'else' (implying any string other than 'increase' or 'decrease') subtracts 10 from the data, which could also lead to an output less than the input, depending on the original data value.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the output is less than the input, then the action was not 'increase', but we cannot be certain it was 'decrease', because data - 10 could have resulted in a smaller output."
