  "Explanation": "While increasing the adjustment factor will raise both 'precision' and 'recall' linearly, the final 'f1_score' is a harmonic mean of these values and doesn't necessarily increase linearly with increases in individual values due to its dependence on the ratio of 'precision' and 'recall'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in the adjustment factor causes an increase in the accuracy, precision, and recall of the metrics, which in turn causes an increase in the f1 score."
