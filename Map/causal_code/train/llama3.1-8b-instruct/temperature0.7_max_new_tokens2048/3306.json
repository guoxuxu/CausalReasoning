  "Explanation": "The code has two age groups divided at age 30. If the age increases from below or at 30 to above 30, the base price increases from 50 to 100, which would directly increase the final adjusted price. Changes within the same age group (below or above 30) don't affect the price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
