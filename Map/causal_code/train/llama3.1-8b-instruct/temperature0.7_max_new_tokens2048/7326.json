  "Explanation": "Several factors besides age can affect the health score decrease, such as changes in diet quality or exercise frequency. Therefore, a decrease in health score does not necessarily indicate an increase in age across the specific 50-year threshold.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
