  "Explanation": "Pre-processing to remove negatives will not affect the 'mean_value', because the 'clean_data' method within the DataProcessor class inherently performs this action. Hence, the preprocessing step outside the class doesn't change resulting 'mean_value' since it duplicates the internal cleaning logic.",
