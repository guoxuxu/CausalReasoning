  "Problem": "Python code above\",\n\nBy manipulating recommended outcomes, can one infer back the exact preferred genre of a user?",
  "Explanation": "Manipulating outcomes indirectly through genre changes won't clearly reveal user preferences unless specific controlled experiments on genre variations are conducted, especially given the straightforward scoring system that only uses genre match and past ratings.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Manipulated outcomes → User preference; User preference → Preferred genre; User behavior → User preference; Preferred genre → User behavior; User behavior → Manipulated outcomes"
