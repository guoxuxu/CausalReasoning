  "Explanation": "Aging from 49 to 51 crosses the threshold set in the code from being less than or equal to 50, where the base score reduction is 10, to being greater than 50, where the base score reduction is 20. Therefore, the health score will decrease solely due to the age change.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
