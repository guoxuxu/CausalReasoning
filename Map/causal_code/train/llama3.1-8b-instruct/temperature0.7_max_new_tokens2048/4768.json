  "Explanation": "The state being 'gas' does not definitively indicate that the temperature was above 100 since no other condition specifically sets the state back to any other form based on temperature directly. However, it is inferred generally in this code that such a temperature is likely the cause without the intervention of pressure modifications or external factors.",
