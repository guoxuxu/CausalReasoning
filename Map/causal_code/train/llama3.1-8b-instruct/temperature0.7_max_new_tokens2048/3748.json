  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data:\n        data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n    if 'income' in data and data.get('is_adult'):\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'high' if data['income'] > 50000 else 'low'\n    return data\",\n\nIf we manually set 'is_adult' to True, regardless of age, will this assure that we enter the income tax bracket calculation?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the data to set 'is_adult' as True manually will cause the flow of the code to proceed to the income tax computation if 'income' is provided, as the condition checks only the boolean value of 'is_adult'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
