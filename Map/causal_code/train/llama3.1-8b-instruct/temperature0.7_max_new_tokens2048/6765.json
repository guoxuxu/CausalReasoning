  "Explanation": "The density is influenced by pressure in two ways: if pressure > 2, density is 0.5 * pressure; otherwise, density is pressure + 1. There are multiple pressure values that can result in a density of 1.5 (e.g., pressure = 1 or 3 atmospheres). Therefore, observing a density of 1.5 does not allow us to conclusively determine the initial pressure was 1 atmosphere.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If temperature is above 100, it causes the state to be gas, and if pressure is above 2, it causes the density to increase, which can lead to a state of gas, but if the temperature is 120, we can't conclusively say pressure was initially 1 atmosphere because density is 1.5, which doesn't require pressure to be exactly 1 atmosphere."
