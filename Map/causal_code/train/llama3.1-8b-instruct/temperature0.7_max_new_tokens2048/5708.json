  "Explanation": "A high performance score is computed from both patient satisfaction and hospital reputation, and these metrics themselves can be affected by varying factors (like decrease in number of doctors, which might not necessarily worsen performance if the decrease is small). Therefore, a high performance score does not straightforwardly infer an increase in doctors without additional information.",
