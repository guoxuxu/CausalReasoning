  "Explanation": "A decrease in speed does not necessarily indicate a deliberate deceleration command by the driver. It might be because the speed was set to a lower value post-deceleration, or speed reaches zero due to a high deceleration value in relation to the current speed, but it's not mandated that this reduction is always due to a deceleration command.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
