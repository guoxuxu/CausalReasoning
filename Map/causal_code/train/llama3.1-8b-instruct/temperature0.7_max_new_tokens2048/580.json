  "Explanation": "The inventory showing 60 apples could be due to various factors such as adding more than 50 initially or removing fewer than 10 apples. Without specific information about these actions, we cannot conclusively say no apples were removed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
