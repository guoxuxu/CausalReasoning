  "Explanation": "In the provided code, after a patient is vaccinated, if they are older than 60, they are automatically marked as not having the flu. Thus, vaccination leads to a person not getting the flu for patients over 60 according to the system's rules.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
