  "Explanation": "The `apply_medication` function sets is_smoker to False if reduce_smoking is True, directly reducing the risk level by 1 if the person was previously a smoker. The function also calls update_risk_level, although its final effect depends on whether the age condition still contributes to the risk level.",
