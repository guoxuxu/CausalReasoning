  "Problem": "class Thermostat {\n  private int temperature;\n  private boolean power;\n\n  public Thermostat() {\n    temperature = 22; // Default room temperature in Celsius\n    power = false; // Thermostat is initially turned off\n  }\n\n  public void turnPowerOn() {\n    power = true;\n  }\n\n  public void turnPowerOff() {\n    power = false;\n  }\n\n  public void setTemperature(int newTemp) {\n    if (power) {\n      temperature = newTemp;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public boolean isPowerOn() {\n    return power;\n  }\n\n  public int getTemperature() {\n    return temperature;\n  }\n\n}\",\n\nIf the power is on, will adjusting the setTemperature method affect the temperature?",
  "Explanation": "When the power is on, the setTemperature method directly modifies the temperature attribute. Therefore, if the power is on and you adjust the temperature through the setTemperature method, the internal temperature state will change accordingly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
