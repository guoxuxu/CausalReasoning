  "Explanation": "A decrease in environment_health could be due to an increase in pollution_level, but it could also be a result of decreased regulation_strictness. Without knowing the exact cause or intervening, we can't definitively say the pollution level has increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
