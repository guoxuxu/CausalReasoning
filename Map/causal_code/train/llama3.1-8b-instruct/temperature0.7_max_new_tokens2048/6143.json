  "Explanation": "Yes, because the algorithm parameter determines whether a linear model or a decision tree model is trained. This affects how the predict method processes new data, thus modifying the algorithm parameter changes the behavior of the predict method directly without any external intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
