  "Explanation": "If the bike accelerates (increases speed by 5) and then following intervention the light is set to 'Red' leading to an observed speed decrease, the only pre-intervention state that allows both acceleration and braking in the same cycle is 'Yellow'. Thus, the light was likely initially 'Yellow'.",
