  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, is_holiday):\n    if is_holiday:\n        discount = 0.15\n    else:\n        discount = 0.05\n\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we manually set the discount to 0.15, will this simulate the effect of a holiday on the final_price?",
  "Explanation": "Manually setting the discount to 0.15 applies the same discount rate as during a holiday, thus the final_price will be reduced by the same percentage as it would be on a holiday.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
