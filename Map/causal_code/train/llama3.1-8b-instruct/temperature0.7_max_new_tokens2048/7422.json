  "Explanation": "Given the initial random range for system_states and influence from external_effect, a state over 0.5 suggests multiple iterations are needed to accumulate such a value, especially considering capping at 1 and the nature of the external effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
