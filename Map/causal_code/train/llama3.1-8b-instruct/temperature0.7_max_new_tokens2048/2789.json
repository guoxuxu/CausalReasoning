  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'temperature' in data:\n        temp_adjust = data['temperature'] * 1.8 + 32\n    else:\n        temp_adjust = 0\n    result = temp_adjust + 10\n    if data.get('pressure', 100) > 120:\n        result += 5\n    return result\",\n\nIf the output 'result' is exactly 15, does this confirm that no 'pressure' manipulation was done above 120?",
  "Explanation": "When 'result' is exactly 15, it means no additional points were added from the 'pressure' condition, thus confirming that the pressure was not manipulated to be above 120. If it were, the result would increase by 5, making the total greater than 15.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
