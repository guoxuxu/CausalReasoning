  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, stock, replenish):\n    for item, sold in sales.items():\n        if item in stock:\n            stock[item] -= sold\n            if stock[item] < 5:\n                if item in replenish:\n                    stock[item] += replenish[item]\n    return stock\",\n\nIf the stock for a particular item is low after the function execution, does this imply the sales for that item were high?",
  "Explanation": "The low stock could also be influenced by having limited initial stock or by stock not being replenished even though it is low, not necessarily only high sales. Hence, the causation from stock level to sales isn't direct.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
