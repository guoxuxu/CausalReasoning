  "Explanation": "A decrease in the method's output, specifically for non-member customers, might imply a change in `firstTimeCustomer` status from true to false. When `firstTimeCustomer` is false, non-members receive no discount, thus reducing the return value compared to when this flag is true.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If the return value of computeDiscount decreases, then firstTimeCustomer was updated from true to false, because a decrease in the return value of computeDiscount is directly influenced by a change in firstTimeCustomer, which in turn is directly influenced by an update to firstTimeCustomer."
