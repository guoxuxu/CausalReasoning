  "Explanation": "An increase in 'interaction_rate' can be influenced by either an increase in 'interactions' or a decrease in 'adjusted_users'. A decrease in 'user_growth_rate' does lead to fewer 'adjusted_users', potentially increasing 'interaction_rate'. However, the same increase could also stem from higher 'interactions'. Unless an intervention specifically controls or observes changes in 'interactions', attributing causality solely to changes in 'user_growth_rate' is not reliable.",
