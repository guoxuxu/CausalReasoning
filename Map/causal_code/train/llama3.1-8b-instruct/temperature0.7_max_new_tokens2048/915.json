  "Explanation": "An increase in updated sales could result from increasing any segment of the budget (social media, TV, or radio ads) or a combination of them. Thus, sales alone can't conclusively tell which specific part was intervened upon without additional specific information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
