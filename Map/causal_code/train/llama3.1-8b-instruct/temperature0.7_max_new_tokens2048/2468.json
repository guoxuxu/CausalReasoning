  "Explanation": "In this causal setup, the only factor directly affecting the rise in blood pressure in the given functions is stress, hence an increase in blood pressure suggests an increase in stress level. However, it's crucial to rule out other external factors not represented in this code which could also influence blood pressure.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
