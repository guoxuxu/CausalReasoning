  "Problem": "def multiply_by_factor(number, factor=2): \n    result = number * factor \n    print('Output:', result) \n    return result \n\nfactor = 5 \nmultiply_by_factor(10, factor)\",\n\nIf the output printed is 50, can we assume the factor was definitely set to 5?",
  "Explanation": "Although the function output of 50 suggests that the factor used in the multiplication might have been 5 (since 10*5=50), there are other possible values for the factor which, when multiplied by 10 or any appropriately adjusted 'number', would give 50. We can't be certain about the specific value of the factor without further information. This tests from effect to cause without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
