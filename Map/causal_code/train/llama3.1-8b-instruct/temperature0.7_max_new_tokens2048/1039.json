  "Problem": "class WeatherStation { float temperature = 25.0; boolean isRaining = false; void updateWeather(float newTemp, boolean rainStatus) { temperature = newTemp; isRaining = rainStatus; } float getTemperature() { return temperature; } boolean getRainStatus() { return isRaining; } } WeatherStation station = new WeatherStation(); station.updateWeather(30.0, true); float currentTemp = station.getTemperature(); boolean currentRainStatus = station.getRainStatus();\",\n\nIf 'getTemperature' returns 25.0 degrees, can we conclude that the 'updateWeather' method was never called?",
  "Explanation": "Returning 25.0 degrees from 'getTemperature' simply reflects the currently set temperature. It's still possible that 'updateWeather' was called but set back to 25.0 degrees, or it was never called since 25.0 is also the initialization value. Without further information on calls between initial instantiation and the call to 'getTemperature', we cannot conclusively determine the previous invocation of 'updateWeather'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
