  "Explanation": "By increasing all sales amounts via the 'Increase Prices' strategy, all records' 'amount' will still be positive if they were positive initially. Since the check for 'Profit' is if all amounts are positive, and none of them turn negative by increasing, 'Profit' will be returned.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
