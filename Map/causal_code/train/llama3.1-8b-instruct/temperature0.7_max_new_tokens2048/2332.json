  "Explanation": "According to the 'determineWeather' method, 'Mild' is returned only when the temperature is between 20 and 30 degrees. Hence, observing a 'Mild' condition directly infers that the temperature must be within that specific range.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
