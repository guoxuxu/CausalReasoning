  "Explanation": "An abnormal increase in internal temperature could be due to other factors not depicted in the given code, such as a malfunctioning system or another heat source. Without specific information confirming manual intervention, the increase can't accurately be attributed solely to that.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
