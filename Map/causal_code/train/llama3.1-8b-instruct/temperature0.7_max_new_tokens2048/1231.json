  "Explanation": "Turning off the heater is an intervention that does not necessarily reflect the current state of `current_temp` relative to `target_temp`. The heater could be turned off manually regardless of the temperatures' comparison. Therefore, this action does not imply a causal effect from `current_temp` changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
