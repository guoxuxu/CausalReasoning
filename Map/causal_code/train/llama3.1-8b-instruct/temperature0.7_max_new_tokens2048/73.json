  "Explanation": "The final_price is recalculated whenever the price is increased, accounting for the current discount. If the discount remains constant, the final_price will increase proportionally to the price increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
