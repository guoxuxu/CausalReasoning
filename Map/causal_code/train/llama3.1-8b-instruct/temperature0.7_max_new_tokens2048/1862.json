  "Problem": "def calculate_cost(products, discount, tax): \n    total = 0 \n    for price in products: \n        total += price \n    if discount > 0: \n        total *= (1 - discount) \n    total *= (1 + tax) \n    return total\",\n\nIf the 'total' value decreases, does that imply the 'tax' rate has decreased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'total' can be attributed to several factors — not only reduction in tax but also due to changes in 'products' prices or an increase in 'discount'. The specific effect of 'total' decreasing cannot be reliably mapped back to the cause of 'tax' rate without understanding the interventions on other variables like 'products' or 'discount'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
