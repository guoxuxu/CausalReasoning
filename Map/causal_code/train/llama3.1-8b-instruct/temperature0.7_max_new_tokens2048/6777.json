  "Problem": "def compute_discount_and_total(price, quantity, membership_status):\n    discount_rate = 0.05 if membership_status == 'Premium' else 0\n    discount = price * quantity * discount_rate\n    tax_rate = 0.07\n    subtotal = price * quantity - discount\n    total = subtotal + (subtotal * tax_rate)\n    return {'discount': discount, 'total': total}\n\nresult = compute_discount_and_total(200, 3, 'Premium')\",\n\nAssuming the total amount decreases after an intervention, did the price per item necessarily decrease?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in the total amount after intervention could result from either a decrease in the price per item, a decrease in quantity, an application of a higher discount rate (changing to 'Premium'), or a combination of these factors. Therefore, a decrease in total does not necessarily imply that the price per item decreased.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the membership status is changed, it affects the discount rate, which in turn affects the discount, subtotal, and total. A change in the price affects the discount, subtotal, and total. A change in the quantity affects the discount, subtotal, and total."
