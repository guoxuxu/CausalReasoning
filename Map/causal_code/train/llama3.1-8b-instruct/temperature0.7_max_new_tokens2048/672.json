  "Explanation": "The mean is calculated as the sum of all elements in the list divided by the number of elements. Increasing the values of the elements will increase the sum, which in turn increases the mean.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
