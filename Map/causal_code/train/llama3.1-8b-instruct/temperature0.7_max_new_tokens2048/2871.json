  "Explanation": "Lower sales (such as 500) occur when the 'effective_price' is 20 or above, but the same sales number happens regardless of how much higher the effective price is above 20. Additionally, a different initial price or discount could have similar effects on sales irrespective of the effective price directly, especially if part of a loyalty program.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
