  "Problem": "class VehicleSystem { constructor() { this.fuelLevel = 100; this.isEngineOn = false; this.speed = 0; } turnOnEngine() { if (this.fuelLevel > 0) { this.isEngineOn = true; this.speed = 10; } } drive() { if (this.isEngineOn) { this.fuelLevel -= 10; this.speed += 20; } } turnOffEngine() { this.isEngineOn = false; this.speed = 0; } checkFuelLevel() { return this.fuelLevel; } }\",\n\nIf the 'turnOnEngine' method is called, will the 'speed' definitely be greater than 0?",
  "Explanation": "Calling 'turnOnEngine' sets 'isEngineOn' to true and initializes 'speed' to 10, assuming fuelLevel > 0, which directly increases 'speed' from 0 to 10, showing the effect of turning on the engine on the vehicle's speed without any other intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
