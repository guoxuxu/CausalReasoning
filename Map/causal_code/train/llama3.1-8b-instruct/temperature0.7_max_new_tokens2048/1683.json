  "Problem": "def compute_scores(temperature, pressure):\n    if temperature > 100:\n        score = 20\n    else:\n        score = 10\n    if pressure > 5:\n        score += 15\n    else:\n        score += 5\n    return score\",\n\nIf the temperature increases beyond 100 degrees without changing the pressure, will the score increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the given code, the score increases to 20 from 10 when the temperature goes beyond 100, if pressure is kept constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
