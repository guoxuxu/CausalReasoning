  "Problem": "def temperature_adjustment(sensor_data): \n  temp = sensor_data['temperature'] \n  humidity = sensor_data['humidity'] \n  if humidity > 50: \n    adjustment = 0.1 * (humidity - 50) \n  else:  \n    adjustment = 0 \n  adjusted_temp = temp - adjustment \n  return adjusted_temp \n \n sensor_data = {'temperature': 80, 'humidity': 60} \n print(temperature_adjustment(sensor_data))\",\n\nIf the adjusted temperature is observed to be lower than expected, can we conclude that the humidity was higher than 50?",
  "Explanation": "Because a reduction in adjusted temperature as opposed to the base temperature only occurs if the humidity contribution computation (humidity above 50 leading to a positive adjustment value) was triggered. Hence, observation of a decreased temperature implies humidity was indeed above 50.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
