  "Explanation": "Although calling increaseTemperature could result in isCold returning false, isCold could also return false if the initial temperature was set above 50 in the constructor. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine that increaseTemperature was called just because isCold returns false.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
