  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data * 5\n    y = x + 10\n    if y > 50:\n        z = True\n    else:\n        z = False\n    return {'x': x, 'y': y, 'z': z}\n\nresult = process_data(10)\",\n\nIf we modify the multiplication factor of 'data' from 5 to 10, will 'z' more likely be True?",
  "Explanation": "By increasing the multiplication factor of 'data' (from 5 to 10), 'x' and correspondingly 'y' will increase for the same 'data'. Given 'y = data * 10 + 10', even smaller values of 'data' are now more likely to result in 'y' surpassing the threshold of 50, thereby making 'z' more likely to be True. This is an example where an intervention (changing the factor from 5 to 10) leads to a different outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
