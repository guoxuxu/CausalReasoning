  "Problem": "class Store { constructor() { this.stock = { apples: 50, oranges: 40 }; this.budget = 1000; } purchaseInventory(item, quantity, pricePerUnit) { if (this.budget >= pricePerUnit * quantity) { this.stock[item] += quantity; this.budget -= pricePerUnit * quantity; } } sellItem(item, quantity, pricePerUnit) { if (this.stock[item] >= quantity) { this.stock[item] -= quantity; this.budget += pricePerUnit * quantity; } } } const groceryStore = new Store(); groceryStore.purchaseInventory('apples', 30, 2); groceryStore.sellItem('oranges', 10, 5);\",\n\nWill increasing the budget ensure more items can be purchased?",
  "Explanation": "While a larger budget allows for the potential purchase of more items, the actual purchase also depends on the price per unit and the quantity of items desired. The budget being sufficient doesn't guarantee that the purchaseInventory method is called or that the store decides to buy more stock.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
