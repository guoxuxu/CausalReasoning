  "Explanation": "A high likelihood of rain is directly dependent on high humidity levels as per the condition (humidity > 85). However, it should be noted that while high likelihood can indicate high humidity, high humidity alone, without appropriate temperature conditions, may not always result in a high likelihood of rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
