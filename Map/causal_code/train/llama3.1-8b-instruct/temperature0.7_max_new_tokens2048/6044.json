  "Problem": "Snippet provided above\",\n\nDoes a successful transaction in 'sell_item' method confirm that 'add_inventory' was called previously for the same item?",
  "Explanation": "The success of 'sell_item', i.e., being able to sell the item, does not necessarily imply that 'add_inventory' was specifically called before. The store might have already had adequate stock from initial setup or previous additions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A successful transaction in'sell_item' method confirms that 'add_inventory' was called previously for the same item, as long as the quantity in stock is greater than zero."
