  "Explanation": "If an increase in marketing spend (which should increase sales) did not lead to an increase in sales, it implies that another factor – in this case, price according to `base_sales = 100 - price` – counteracted this effect. Given this is the only other factor in the code affecting sales, an increase in price is a likely inference.",
