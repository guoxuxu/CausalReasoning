  "Explanation": "A decrease in cartTotal could either be due to a discount code being applied, as handled in the applyDiscount method, or due to products being removed from the cart through the removeProduct method. Therefore, a decrease in cartTotal doesn't definitively indicate that a discount was applied.",
