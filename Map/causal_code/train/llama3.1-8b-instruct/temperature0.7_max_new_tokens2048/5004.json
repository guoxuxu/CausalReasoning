  "Problem": "def process_data(data, threshold, flag): \n    if flag: \n        modified_data = [x * 2 for x in data] \n    else: \n        modified_data = [x / 2 for x in data] \n    result = [] \n    for value in modified_data: \n        if value > threshold: \n            result.append(True) \n        else: \n            result.append(False) \n    return result\",\n\nIf there is an increase in the number of True values in the result, can this be attributed exclusively to changes in the 'flag' value?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in True values in the result can occur due to changes in either the 'data', 'threshold', or 'flag'. Change in 'flag' affects how 'data' is modified, but similar effects might also be caused by changes in 'data' magnitude or changes in 'threshold'. Therefore, attribution to 'flag' changes alone is incorrect without eliminating the influence of 'threshold' and 'data'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
