  "Explanation": "An increase in the ratio (observed effect) does not necessarily imply just an increase in pressure (cause) since the numerator (pressure) or a simultaneous decrease in temperature can achieve the same effect. Without knowing which component changed, it's incorrect to conclude that only pressure was increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
