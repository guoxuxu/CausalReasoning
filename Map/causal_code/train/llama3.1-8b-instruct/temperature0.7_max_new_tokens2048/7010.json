  "Problem": "def compute_score(health_index, environment_factor, genetic_factor):\n    base_score = 50\n    adjusted_health_score = base_score + (health_index * 10) - (environment_factor * 5)\n    final_score = adjusted_health_score + (genetic_factor * 15)\n    return final_score\",\n\nIf health_index increases, will final_score increase without any other changes?",
  "Explanation": "In the function, final_score is dependent on adjusted_health_score, which directly incorporates health_index multiplied by 10. An increase in health_index leads to an increase in adjusted_health_score and thus increases final_score. This is a direct causal relationship without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in health_index directly causes an increase in adjusted_health_score, and an increase in adjusted_health_score directly causes an increase in final_score, which means an increase in health_index indirectly causes an increase in final_score."
