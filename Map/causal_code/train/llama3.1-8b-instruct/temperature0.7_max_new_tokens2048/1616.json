  "Explanation": "Following the code, the only scenario for a risk status of 'At risk' without intervention occurs when both age > 50 and daily steps < 5000 are true. Consequently, if someone is 'At risk', their age being over 50 is a necessary condition, hence we can infer they are over 50.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
