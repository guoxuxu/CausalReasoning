  "Explanation": "The 'category' filter is used to filter the data list, including only those items where the 'category' matches the specified value in 'filters'. This directly affects the quantity of items that will appear in the output list. If changed, it will potentially alter how many items pass through this filter condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
