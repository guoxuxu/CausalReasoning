  "Problem": "class WeatherForecast:\n    def __init__(self, temperature, humidity):\n        self.temperature = temperature\n        self.humidity = humidity\n        if self.humidity > 50:\n            self.weather = 'rainy'\n        elif self.temperature > 20:\n            self.weather = 'sunny'\n        else:\n            self.weather = 'cloudy'\n\nforecast = WeatherForecast(25, 60)\nprint(forecast.weather)\",\n\nIf an intervention changes the temperature to 15 while the humidity remains 60, will the observed weather still be rainy?",
  "Explanation": "Since the code dictates that humidity levels greater than 50 result in rainy weather, adjusting temperature does not alter this outcome. The weather is determined to be 'rainy' strictly based on humidity, irrespective of the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
