  "Explanation": "Even with the 'discount_rate' above 0%, if most items in 'prices' are below 50, their corresponding values in 'discounted_prices' will be unchanged because the discount condition applies only to items priced at 50 or above.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
