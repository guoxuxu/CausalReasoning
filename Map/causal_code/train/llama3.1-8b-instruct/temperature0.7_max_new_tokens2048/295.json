  "Explanation": "The intervention of manually setting the weather type to 'sunny' triggers the setForecast method, which in turn sets the temperature to 30. This is a clear cause (intervention) to effect (temperature change) relationship with intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
