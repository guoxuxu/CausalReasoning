  "Explanation": "If an intervention shows uniformly lower final_interest, it suggests the new rate adjustment scheme was applied, causing the reduction, given the direct relationship between rate and interest in the formula.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
