  "Problem": "def compute_scores(data):\n   if 'age' in data:\n       base_score = 50\n       age = data['age']\n       if age > 30:\n           base_score += 20\n       else:\n           base_score += 10\n   if 'experience' in data:\n       experience = data['experience']\n       if experience > 5:\n           base_score += 30\n       else:\n           base_score += 15\n   return base_score\",\n\nIf the age in the data increases beyond 30, will the compute_scores function return a higher score compared to an age of 30 or less?",
  "Explanation": "The function increases the base score by 20 if the age is greater than 30, as compared to an increase of 10 for ages less than or equal to 30, resulting in a higher total score for ages greater than 30.",
