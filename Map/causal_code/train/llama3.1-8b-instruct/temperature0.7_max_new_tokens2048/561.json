  "Explanation": "The temperature increases when it is Sunday because the code multiplies the temperature by 1.1 only on Sundays. This increase happens directly because of the day being Sunday and does not involve changes through other variables like season in this context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
