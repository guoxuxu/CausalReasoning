  "Explanation": "The 'risk_factor' method increments the risk if a person's age is greater than 50. As age increases from below to above 50, the risk score increases by 1, which could shift the health status from 'Low Risk' to 'High Risk' under the conditions laid out in 'health_status' method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
