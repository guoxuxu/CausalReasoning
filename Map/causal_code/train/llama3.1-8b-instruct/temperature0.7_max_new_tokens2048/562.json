  "Explanation": "Although Sundays cause an increase in temperature, a higher temperature can also result from it being Winter (as the adjust_temperature function increases the temperature by 5 degrees during Winter). Therefore, a higher temperature does not necessarily mean it was Sunday.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
