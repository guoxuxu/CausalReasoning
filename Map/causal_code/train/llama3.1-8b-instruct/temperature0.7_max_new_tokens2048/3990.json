  "Problem": "def predict_sales(price, ad_budget, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        base_sales = 120\n    else:\n        base_sales = 100\n    adjusted_price_effect = price * -0.5\n    ad_effect = ad_budget * 0.4\n    total_sales = base_sales + adjusted_price_effect + ad_effect\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf the ad_budget increases, will the total_sales increase without any other changes?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, there is a direct positive relationship between ad_budget and total_sales. Specifically, total_sales increases by 0.4 for every unit increase in ad_budget, holding all other factors constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
