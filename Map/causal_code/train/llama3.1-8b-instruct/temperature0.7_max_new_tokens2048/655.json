  "Explanation": "Changing 'bonus_sales' to 200 through an external intervention does not imply any causal adjustment to 'discount_factor'. The code assigns 'bonus_sales' based on 'discount_factor' conditions directly, and any external changes to 'bonus_sales' do not feedback to affect 'discount_factor'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
