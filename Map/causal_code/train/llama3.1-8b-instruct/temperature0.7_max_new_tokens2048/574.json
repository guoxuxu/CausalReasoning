  "Problem": "def compute_health_scores(age, diet_quality, physical_activity_level):\n    base_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_score -= 10\n    if diet_quality < 5:\n        base_score -= 30\n    if physical_activity_level > 7:\n        base_score += 20\n    return base_score\",\n\nDoes a lower health score necessarily suggest the individual has a poor diet?",
  "Explanation": "A lower health score could also be influenced by other factors like age and physical activity level. The code integrates changes from multiple variables (age, diet_quality, physical_activity_level), so a change in score cannot exclusively indicate diet quality without considering other factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
