  "Explanation": "While weather_factor does affect final_sales (impact via multiplication with base_sales), an observed increase in forecasted sales could also be due to the promotional boost, stock variables (handled by random conditions in the code), or a change in base sales; thus, the causal relationship between increased sales and better weather is not deterministic without additional information.",
