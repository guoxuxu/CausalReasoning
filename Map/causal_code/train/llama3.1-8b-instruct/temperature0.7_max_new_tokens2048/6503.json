  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\\\n    x = input_data * 2\\\n    y = x + 4\\\n    if y > 20:\\\n        z = y * 2\\\n    else:\\\n        z = y - 2\\\n    return z\",\n\nIf the value of input_data is increased, will the output of the function also increase without other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "In the function, x is directly proportional to input_data (x = input_data * 2), and y depends linearly on x (y = x + 4). Whether y results in z being y * 2 or y - 2, z is still dependent on the value of y, and hence on input_data. An increase in input_data increases x, which increases y, thus increasing z in both conditional outcomes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the value of input_data increases, then the value of x will also increase, which will lead to an increase in y, and consequently, the value of z will increase or decrease depending on the value of y."
