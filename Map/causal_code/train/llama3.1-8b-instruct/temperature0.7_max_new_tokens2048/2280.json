  "Explanation": "While an increase in internal temperature often suggests the heater was turned on, which indicates the external temperature might have been below 18, this cannot be confirmed without more information. The temperature increase could also be due to previously lower external temperatures, and the external temperature might have since changed. Thus, internal temperature increasing does not reliably allow us to infer a decrease in external temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
