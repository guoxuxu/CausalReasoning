  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'user_activity' in data:\n        if data['user_activity'] > 100:\n            data['category'] = 'high'\n        else:\n            data['category'] = 'low'\n    else:\n        data['category'] = 'unknown'\n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'category' is 'unknown', can we conclude that 'user_activity' was missing in the input data?",
  "Explanation": "The only condition under which 'category' is set to 'unknown' is when 'user_activity' is not a key in the data. Hence, seeing 'unknown' as the category directly informs us about the absence of 'user_activity'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
