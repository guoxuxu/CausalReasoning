  "Problem": "def process_data(data_list):\n    processed_list = []\n    for data in data_list:\n        if data % 2 == 0:\n            processed_list.append(data * 10)\n        else:\n            processed_list.append(data + 10)\n    return processed_list\",\n\nIf you remove the if-else condition and directly multiply each data item by 10, will the processed_list contain only even numbers?",
  "Explanation": "Without the conditional check (if-else statement), every number whether even or odd is multiplied by 10. This will indeed make all previously even numbers still even, but the originally odd numbers, when multiplied by 10, will also become even. Thus rendering the whole list even numbers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
