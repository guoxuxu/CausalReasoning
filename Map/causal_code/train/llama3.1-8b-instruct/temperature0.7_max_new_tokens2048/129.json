  "Explanation": "The function `process_data` filters out individuals whose age is 20 or less before calculating the average age. Therefore, adding more people under 20 would not affect the computed average age as they are excluded from the calculation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
