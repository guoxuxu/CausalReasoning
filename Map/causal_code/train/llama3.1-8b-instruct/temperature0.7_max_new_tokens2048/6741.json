  "Explanation": "If `filter_data` was modified to filter out all even numbers instead of just based on the condition specified, it would result in an empty dataset for `analyze_data`, which would cause an error or an invalid operation rather than just a decrease in the average. A mere decrease suggests changes might have occurred in the input data type or numbers, rather than complete omission of a data class (i.e., all even numbers).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
