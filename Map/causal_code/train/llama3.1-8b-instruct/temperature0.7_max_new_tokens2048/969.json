  "Explanation": "This is from effect to cause without intervention. Low health could result from either a significant negative impact of the environment or a less effective or missing treatment, or both; the specific cause isn't determined solely by the low final health outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
