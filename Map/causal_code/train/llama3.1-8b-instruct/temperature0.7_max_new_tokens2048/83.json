  "Explanation": "Based on the `activity_feedback` function, the feedback rating for a picnic (activity corresponding to sunny weather) is 8, which is higher than the rating for watching movies (5). By intervening to set the weather consistently sunny, the consequent activity is always a picnic, effectively ensuring a higher feedback rating.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
