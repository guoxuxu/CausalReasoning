  "Explanation": "Although increasing days_ahead increases the forecast temperature, the forecast also depends negatively on humidity. An increase in forecast temperature could also be due to a decrease in humidity or the inherent base temperature. Since the relationship isn’t uniquely determined by days_ahead, the answer is no.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
