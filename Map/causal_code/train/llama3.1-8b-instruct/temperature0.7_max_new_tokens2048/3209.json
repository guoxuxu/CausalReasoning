  "Problem": "def calculateInterest(balance, rate): \n    if balance > 1000: \n        interest = balance * (rate / 100) \n    else: \n        interest = balance * (rate / 2 / 100) \n    return interest\",\n\nAssuming an intervention that fixes the interest to a higher value, is it necessary that the balance had to increase?",
  "Explanation": "Fixing the interest to a higher value can be achieved either by increasing the balance or increasing the rate, or through a combination of both. Thus, it’s not necessary that only the balance had to increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
