  "Explanation": "While the 'car_speed' method sets a car's speed to 0 if its corresponding light is red, a red light does not guarantee that all cars controlled by other lights are stationary. Other lights might be green, allowing associated cars to move.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
