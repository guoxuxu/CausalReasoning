  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate \n    total_price = price + tax_amount - discount \n    demand = max(0, 100 - total_price) \n    return total_price, demand\n\nprice = 100 \ntax_rate = 0.05 \ndiscount = 10 \n\nrevenue, demand = compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount) \n\n# Implement a promotional campaign \ndef promotion_effect(demand):\n    new_demand = demand + 20 \n    return new_demand\n\n# Calculate new demand after promotion \nnew_demand = promotion_effect(demand)\",\n\nIf we implement a promotional campaign to add 20 more units to demand, does this directly affect the total_price?",
  "Explanation": "The promotional campaign function adds a fixed increase to demand and does not alter the total_price directly. The total_price remains calculated from price, tax_rate, and discount as before and isn't affected by the change in demand due to promotion.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
