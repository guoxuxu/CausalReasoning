  "Explanation": "The health score is influenced by multiple factors including daily exercise minutes, whether supplements are taken, and whether a healthy diet is maintained. An increase in health score could result from any combination of these variables changing, not necessarily an increase in daily exercise minutes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
