  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention - A risk of 0.5 could occur in two scenarios according to the code: a person over 50 without symptoms (0.4 risk from age + 0.0 from symptoms) or a younger person with symptoms (0.2 risk from age + 0.3 from symptoms). Therefore, the presence of symptoms cannot be solely inferred from the risk level.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
