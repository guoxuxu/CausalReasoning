  "Problem": "def increment(x): return x + 1\ndef double(x): return x * 2\ndef process_data(x): y = increment(x); z = double(y); return z\",\n\nIf the input value `x` is increased, will the final output of `process_data` function increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing `x` directly influences the output of the `increment` function by increasing its output (`y`). Since `y` is the input for `double`, and `double` multiplies its input by 2, the final output `z` is directly proportional to the input `x`. Thus, an increase in `x` causes an increase in `z` with no intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
