  "Explanation": "In the code, when the temperature exceeds 25 degrees Celsius, the 'cloudy' attribute is explicitly set to True, indicating a direct causal relationship from the high temperature to cloudiness.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
