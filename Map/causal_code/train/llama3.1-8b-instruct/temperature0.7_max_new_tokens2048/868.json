  "Explanation": "The increase_temperature method is called twice, adding 10 degrees (2 * 5 degrees) to the initial temperature of 50 degrees, making it 60 degrees. Though evaporation is checked when temperature reaches 100 degrees, the temperature only rises to 60 degrees, which is insufficient to cause evaporation. The initial interpretation is incorrect; evaporation does not occur. Correct Answer: No",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
