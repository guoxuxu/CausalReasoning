  "Explanation": "Adjusting the output of the `risk_of_heatstroke` method (the risk level) is purely a label based on the existing conditions of temperature and humidity. Changing this label or classification does not have a backward effect on the actual physical conditions of temperature or humidity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
