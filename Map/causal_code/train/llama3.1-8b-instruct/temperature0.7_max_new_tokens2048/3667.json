  "Explanation": "An increase in the total_balance can result from an increase in interest_rate, an increase in account_balance, or the condition for a higher bonus being met. Thus, increasing total_balance alone does not uniquely imply that the interest_rate must have been increased. This reflects the complexity of backward causation without direct intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
