  "Explanation": "An increase from the multiply method might or might not result in an increase in the sum from the add method. For instance, if values moved from (2,3) to (6,1), the product increases but the sum remains the same. Hence, there is no direct causation from the output of multiply to the output of add, illustrating a lack of causal inference from effect to cause without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
