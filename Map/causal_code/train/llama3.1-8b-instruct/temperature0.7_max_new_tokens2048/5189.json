  "Explanation": "Turning off the boiler sets the isPowerOn to false and resets the temperature to 20, which is room temperature. Even if initially the temperature might have been higher, repeatedly calling the coolDown method will decrement the temperature by 3 degrees each time until reaching the lower bound of 20 degrees.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Turning off the WaterBoiler and repeatedly calling the coolDown method will eventually cause the temperature of the water to decrease, but it will not necessarily reach room temperature because the coolDown method only reduces the temperature by 3 when the boiler is off and the temperature is above 20."
