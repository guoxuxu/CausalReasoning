  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_value, use_filter=True):\n    if use_filter:\n        filtered_data = [d for d in data if d > filter_value]\n    else:\n        filtered_data = data\n    result = sum(filtered_data) / len(filtered_data)\n    return result\",\n\nIf 'use_filter' is set to False, does it affect the value of 'filtered_data'?",
  "Explanation": "When 'use_filter' is set to False, the code bypasses the filtering condition which checks if each data point is greater than 'filter_value'. Instead, it assigns the original 'data' list directly to 'filtered_data'. Thus, the condition directly affects the content of 'filtered_data'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
