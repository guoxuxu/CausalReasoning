  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(discount, base_price, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        increase = 0.10\n    else:\n        increase = -0.05\n    price_after_discount = base_price * (1 - discount)\n    final_price = price_after_discount * (1 + increase)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the season changes from low to high, would the final_price increase, assuming no changes in discount and base_price?",
  "Explanation": "The 'season' directly affects the 'increase' which in turn modifies the 'final_price'. When the season changes from low to high, 'increase' changes from -0.05 to 0.10, leading to a higher final_price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
