  "Problem": "def student_performance(height, study_hours, part_time_job):\n  stress_level = 0.4 * part_time_job\n  rest_quality = -0.3 * stress_level\n  study_efficiency = study_hours * (0.5 + 0.2 * rest_quality)\n  health = 0.6 * height - 0.5 * stress_level\n  performance = 0.3 * health + 0.7 * study_efficiency\n  return performance\n\n# Example invocation\nperformance = student_performance(170, 5, 1)\",\n\nSuppose performance drops significantly; does introducing stress management interventions necessarily indicate the cause for the drop was primarily stress?",
  "Explanation": "While stress is one factor influencing performance, multiple components contribute to performance including health and study_efficiency. Intervening with stress management can be an exploratory step, but it does not conclusively establish that stress was the primary cause of the performance drop without considering other factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Introducing stress management interventions may improve performance by reducing stress, which in turn improves health and study efficiency, thereby improving performance."
