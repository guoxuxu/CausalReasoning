  "Problem": "def compute_savings(salary, expenses, tax_rate): \n    after_tax_income = salary * (1 - tax_rate) \n    savings = after_tax_income - expenses \n    return savings\",\n\nDoes a decrease in savings imply an increase in the tax rate?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in savings can be due to either an increase in expenses or an increase in the tax rate, or a decrease in salary. Therefore, a decrease in savings cannot unequivocally imply an increase in the tax rate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
