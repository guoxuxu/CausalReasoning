  "Explanation": "Limiting the distance of trips directly reduces the amount of fuel required for each trip. Consequently, this intervention will lead to an increase in remaining fuel after the trips, allowing the vehicle to potentially make more trips or travel longer cumulatively before the next refuel.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
