  "Problem": "Example Python code above with classes Product, Promotion, and User\",\n\nIf a regular user can apply a discount to a product, has there been an alteration in the system's user role handling?",
  "Explanation": "Normally, regular users cannot apply discounts. If one does, it indicates an unauthorized change in user privileges or system behavior manipulation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
