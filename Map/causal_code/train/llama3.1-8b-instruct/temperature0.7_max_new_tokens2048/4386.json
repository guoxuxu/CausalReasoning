  "Explanation": "Introducing a deduction function that applies a consistent reduction and observing a consequent decrease in 'final_total' suggests the deduction function is causative in lowering the 'final_total'. Given no other changes and the direct application effects of this function, it's reasonable to attribute the change to this intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
