  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount decreases the price of the product because the final selling price is calculated by applying a percentage reduction. Since VAT is calculated based on the final selling price, a lower price results in lower VAT.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
