  "Explanation": "Manually increasing each element by 5 will increase the sum of the data, thus increasing the mean_val. Since adjusted_mean is calculated based on the mean_val (and possibly a further condition based on length), this intervention will generally lead to an increase in adjusted_mean, barring any other compensatory reductions in data values or lengths.",
