  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_key, operation, threshold): \n    filtered_data = [d for d in data if d[filter_key] >= threshold]\n    if operation == 'sum':\n        result = sum(filtered_data)\n    elif operation == 'count':\n        result = len(filtered_data)\n    else:\n        result = None\n    return result\",\n\nIf the 'threshold' value is increased, will the function 'process_data' necessarily always return a lower or the same result for the 'count' operation?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the threshold filters out more items, resulting in fewer or equal items passing the filter. This leads to a count of less or equal items.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
