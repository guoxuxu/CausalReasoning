  "Explanation": "Intervening by manually adding 'errors' into the data triggers the first 'if' statement condition, ensuring that 'status' is set to 'failed', no matter what other contents are inside the data. This shows the effect of an intervention on the cause-effect relationship.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
