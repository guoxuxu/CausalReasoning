  "Explanation": "The true alert flag is set if any normalized data exceeds 2. Normalization involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. A true flag result means that after this transformation, at least one value exceeded 2, indicating it was originally far from the mean compared to the standard deviation.",
