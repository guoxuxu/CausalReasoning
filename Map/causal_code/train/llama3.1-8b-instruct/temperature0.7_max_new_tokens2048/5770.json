  "Explanation": "Improvement in the health score depends on multiple factors like diet, age, and exercise. Thus, an increase in the health score doesn’t conclusively indicate which of these factors was altered; it is possible that exercise was increased or dietary changes might have taken place, but other factors could also contribute.",
