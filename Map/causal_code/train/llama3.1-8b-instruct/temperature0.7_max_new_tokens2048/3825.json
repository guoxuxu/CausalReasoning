  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data['x']\n    y = 2 * x + data['noise']\n    z = y - data.get('adjustment', 0)\n    return {'result': z}\n\ninput_data = {'x': 5, 'noise': 3}\noutput = process_data(input_data)\",\n\nIf we manipulate 'result' to always return a fixed value, can changes in 'x' influence 'noise'?",
  "Explanation": "Changing 'result' to a fixed value effectively decouples it from the dependencies dictated by 'x', 'noise', and 'adjustment'. However, this intervention does not create a causal pathway where changes in 'x' can influence 'noise'. Their relationship in the original code does not support such a reverse causality; 'noise' independently adds to 'y' alongside '2*x', and manipulating 'result' does not change this fact.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
