  "Explanation": "Speed increase could theoretically be caused by other factors or methods not shown in the code (like possibly an 'accelerate' method), or modifications to 'speed' directly from outside of the provided methods. Thus, observing an increase in speed does not definitively indicate that 'drive' was called.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
