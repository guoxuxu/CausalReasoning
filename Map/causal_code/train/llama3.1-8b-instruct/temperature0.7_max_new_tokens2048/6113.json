  "Problem": "def student_grades(hours_studied, class_attendance, current_grade):\n    if class_attendance > 75:\n        performance_boost = 0.1\n    else:\n        performance_boost = 0\n\n    if hours_studied > 5:\n        study_boost = 0.2\n    else:\n        study_boost = 0\n\n    final_grade = current_grade + (current_grade * (performance_boost + study_boost))\n    return final_grade\n\ninitial_grade = 70\nfinal_score = student_grades(6, 80, initial_grade)\",\n\nIf an intervention increases the performance_boost for students with class attendance just below 75%, will this improve final grades?",
  "Explanation": "The performance_boost is directly tied to attendance percentages via thresholds in the code. An intervention that changes the criteria or effect of class attendance on performance_boost (e.g., lowering the required threshold or increasing the provided boost) would raise performance_boost thus directly affecting the final_grade positively if other factors remain constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "class_attendance → performance_boost; performance_boost → final_grade; hours_studied → study_boost; study_boost → final_grade; initial_grade → final_grade",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Class attendance affects final grades by potentially improving performance, which in turn influences final grades. Studying more than 5 hours affects final grades by improving study, which also influences final grades. The initial grade is a direct factor in determining final grades."
