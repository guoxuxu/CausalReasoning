  "Problem": "Refer to the provided Python implementation of SalesPredictor.\",\n\nWill applying a 5% discount always increase sales compared to base sales without a promotion?",
  "Explanation": "The method apply_discount directly increases sales based on the given discount_percentage, independent of promotions. Here, every increase by 5% in discount leads to a proportional increase in sales from base sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "discount → discounted_price; discounted_price → promotional_sales; base_sales → promotional_sales",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a discount directly affects the discounted price, which in turn affects promotional sales, and base sales also directly affect promotional sales, but the effect of discount on sales is indirect and depends on the relationship between discounted price and promotional sales."
