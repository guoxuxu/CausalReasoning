  "Explanation": "While changing the status to 'premium' suggests an increase in balance, it does not specify that a particular transaction directly caused the status change without knowing the previous balance or if multiple transactions occurred.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
