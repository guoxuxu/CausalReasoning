  "Explanation": "Increasing temperature following the observation of sunny weather changes the original causal context. The sunny weather could now partly be due to the artificially increased temperature, not just the low humidity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
