  "Problem": "class SalesAnalysis { double discount; double price; double increaseTraffic(double factor) { return factor * 0.5; } double salePrice() { return price - (price * discount); } }\",\n\nAssuming 'increaseTraffic' has increased due to an intervention, can we infer there has been a change in 'discount' or 'price'?",
  "Explanation": "Based on the class definition, 'increaseTraffic' does not influence or reflect changes in 'discount' or 'price'. It calculates based on its own internal logic and does not modify or depend on the class variables 'price' or 'discount'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
