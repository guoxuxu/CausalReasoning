  "Problem": "def classify_student(scores): \n    if scores['math'] > 90 and scores['science'] > 85: \n        return 'high' \n    elif scores['math'] < 60 or scores['science'] < 60: \n        return 'low' \n    else: \n        return 'average'\",\n\nIf a student is classified as 'high', did they likely score more than 90 in math?",
  "Explanation": "The classification 'high' is determined if a student scores over 90 in math and over 85 in science. Thus, scoring more than 90 in math is a necessary part of achieving this classification.",
