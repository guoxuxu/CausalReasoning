  "Problem": "def weather_effect(day):\n  if day == 'sunny':\n    mood = 'happy'\n    productivity = 'high'\n  elif day == 'rainy':\n    mood = 'sad'\n    productivity = 'low'\n  else:\n    mood = 'neutral'\n    productivity = 'medium'\n  return mood, productivity\n\nweather = 'sunny'\nmood, productivity = weather_effect(weather)\",\n\nAfter artificially setting productivity to 'high', can we assume the weather was sunny?",
  "Explanation": "Setting productivity to 'high' through an intervention does not provide information about the actual weather condition, as the relationship is unidirectional from weather to productivity in the code. Hence, high productivity achieved through artificial means does not imply sunny weather.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
