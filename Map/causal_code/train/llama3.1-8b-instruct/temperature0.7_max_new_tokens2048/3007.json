  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    cleaned_data = clean(data)\n    analyzed_data = analyze(cleaned_data)\n    return analyzed_data\n\ndef clean(data):\n    data['age'] = data['age'].fillna(data['age'].mean())\n    data['income'] = data['income'] * 1.10 # adjusting income\n    return data\n\ndef analyze(data):\n    high_income = data[data['income'] > 50000]\n    high_income['risk_factor'] = high_income['age'] * 0.2\n    return high_income\n\",\n\nIf there is a high `risk_factor`, can we infer that the `income` was adjusted in the `clean` function?",
  "Explanation": "The calculation of `risk_factor` solely relies on the `age` and does not directly depend on the income. Even though the `income` is adjusted in the `clean` function, this does not affect the calculation of the `risk_factor`; hence, observing a high `risk_factor` cannot specifically let us infer the manipulation of `income`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
