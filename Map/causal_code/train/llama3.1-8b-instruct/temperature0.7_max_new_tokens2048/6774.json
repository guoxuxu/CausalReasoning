  "Problem": "def compute_discount_and_total(price, quantity, membership_status):\n    discount_rate = 0.05 if membership_status == 'Premium' else 0\n    discount = price * quantity * discount_rate\n    tax_rate = 0.07\n    subtotal = price * quantity - discount\n    total = subtotal + (subtotal * tax_rate)\n    return {'discount': discount, 'total': total}\n\nresult = compute_discount_and_total(200, 3, 'Premium')\",\n\nDoes changing the membership status from 'Standard' to 'Premium' affect the total amount?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the membership status affects the discount rate. A 'Premium' status triggers a discount, which directly decreases the subtotal, and consequently, affects the total, even without directly modifying other variables like price or quantity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
