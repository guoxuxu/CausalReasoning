  "Explanation": "Since the person is already not hungry, calling the eat method does not change their hunger state, regardless of the food availability. The method checks if the person is hungry before changing the hunger state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
