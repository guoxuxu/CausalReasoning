  "Explanation": "Increasing the price decreases demand under normal market conditions, which in turn diminishes sales, even though the direct multiplication of price and current demand suggests otherwise. The model does not explicitly encapsulate a price-demand elasticity aside from this implied effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
