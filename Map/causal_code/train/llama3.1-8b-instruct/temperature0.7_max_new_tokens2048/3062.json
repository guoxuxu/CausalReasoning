  "Explanation": "Increasing values in data_sequence would lead to either similar or higher values in processed_data (since only numbers greater than 5 are tripled), which raises the overall sum and potentially the average, given the size of processed_data remains constant or increases. This results in a higher average value being calculated and printed in the analyze_data function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
