  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  if 'error' in data:\n    data['status'] = 'failed'\n  else:\n    data['status'] = 'success'\n    if data['user'] == 'admin':\n      data['access_level'] = 'full'\n    else:\n      data['access_level'] = 'limited'\n  return data\",\n\nIf we modify the function to ignore 'error' values in the data, and the input user is 'admin', will the status be 'success'?",
  "Explanation": "By modifying the function to ignore 'error' values, the pathway that sets the status to 'failed' is bypassed. Consequently, since the user is 'admin', the function will process to set the status to 'success' as there would no longer be a condition that sets it to 'failed'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
