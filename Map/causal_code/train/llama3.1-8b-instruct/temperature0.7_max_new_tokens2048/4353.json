  "Explanation": "According to the code, the 'isRaining' status is set to true if the temperature drops below 0 during an adjustment. If temperatures are high, the adjustment conditions that lead to rain are not met, hence less (or no) rain.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature is persistently high, it will result in less rain because it reduces the likelihood of external rain triggering rain and also makes it less likely for the temperature to drop below 5."
