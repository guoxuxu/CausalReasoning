  "Explanation": "By applying a coupon code 'SAVE30', a discount of 30 is given, reducing the base price from 100 to 70. Given the conditions that the person is not a student and is over 18, no other discounts apply, so the final price is directly reduced by exactly 30.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
