  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    data.sort()\n    if flag:\n        data = [x * 2 for x in data]\n    else:\n        data = [x + 10 for x in data]\n    return data\n\nflag = True\ndata = [10, 5, 7]\nfinal_data = process_data(data, flag)\",\n\nFollowing the completion of `process_data`, is `flag` determined to be `True` if all elements in `final_data` are negative?",
  "Explanation": "Since both operations (multiplying by 2 or adding 10) under different flag conditions can produce varying results depending on the original `data`, this outcome wouldn’t conclusively determine the state of `flag` without knowledge of the original input values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
