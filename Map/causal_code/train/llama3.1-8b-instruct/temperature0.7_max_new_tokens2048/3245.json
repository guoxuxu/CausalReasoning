  "Problem": "def process_data(data, factor, offset): \n\\tadjusted_data = [x * factor for x in data] \n\\tfinal_data = [y + offset for y in adjusted_data] \n\\treturn final_data \n\nresult = process_data([1, 2, 3], 2, 5)\",\n\nAfter setting 'factor' to a constant value, if the differences in 'final_data' values are observed to change, does this imply that 'offset' was adjusted?",
  "Explanation": "With 'factor' held constant, the only other element in the function that can affect 'final_data' is 'offset'. Therefore, changes in differences between values of 'final_data' indicate that an intervention (change in 'offset') has occurred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
