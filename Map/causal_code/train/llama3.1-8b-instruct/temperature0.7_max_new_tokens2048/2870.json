  "Explanation": "The response to a price increase affecting sales depends on whether the customer is part of the loyalty program and what the existing price and discount are. The calculation of 'effective_price' and the subsequent sales numbers can vary. If 'effective_price' stays below 20 after the price increment, sales might not decrease.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
