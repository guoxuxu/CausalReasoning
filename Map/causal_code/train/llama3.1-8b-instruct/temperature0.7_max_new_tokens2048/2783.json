  "Explanation": "A 10% discount only indicates that the user has made more than 5 total purchases; it cannot confirm when the most recent purchase was made, as a recent purchase less than 3 months ago would give the same discount if total purchases were 5 or fewer.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
