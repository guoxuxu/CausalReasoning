  "Explanation": "While the alarm can be set on due to high temperature (>=100.4), the alarm could also be activated due to high blood pressure (either systolic >= 140 or diastolic >= 90). Therefore, alarm being on does not necessarily imply that temperature was updated to a high value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
