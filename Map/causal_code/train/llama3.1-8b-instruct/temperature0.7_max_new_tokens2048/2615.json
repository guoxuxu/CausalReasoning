  "Explanation": "A lower fuel level can result from long distances driven but can also be due to starting with less fuel or other consuming activities. Without more context on initial conditions or intervening refuels, we can't definitively infer driving distance from fuel level.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
