  "Explanation": "The `process_data` function multiplies the input by 2 and checks if the result is greater than 100. If `True` is returned, it means the condition 'modified_data > 100' was met. Therefore, the original input must have been greater than 50 for `modified_data` (input * 2) to be greater than 100.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
