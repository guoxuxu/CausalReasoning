  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    modified_data = data * 2 \n    final_data = modified_data + 100 \n    return final_data\n\nresult = process_data(50)\",\n\nDoes the value of 'final_data' being 200 imply that 'process_data' was definitely called with an input of 50?",
  "Explanation": "While an input of 50 leads to a 'final_data' of 200, there can be other manipulations inside or outside the function that could also produce a 'final_data' of 200, such as altering 'modified_data' or the base addition of 100. The question wrongly assumes a one-to-one mapping without accounting for code modifications or additional influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
