  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    base = 5\n    data_squared = [x**2 for x in data]\n    data_multiplied = [x * base for x in data]\n    sum_squared = sum(data_squared)\n    sum_multiplied = sum(data_multiplied)\n    final_value = sum_squared + sum_multiplied\n    return final_value\",\n\nIf you intervene to set 'final_value' to a lower number, does this necessarily mean 'data' had small numbers initially?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'final_value' directly does not affect the input 'data', nor does it retroactively alter the initial data's characteristics. Other factors such as lowering 'base' or errors in calculation could have also contributed to the reduction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
