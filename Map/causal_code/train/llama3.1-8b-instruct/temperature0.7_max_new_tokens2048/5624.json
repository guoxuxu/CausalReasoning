  "Problem": "def compute_final_price(base_price, tax_rate, discount, has_discount):\n    tax_amount = base_price * tax_rate\n    if has_discount:\n        discount_amount = base_price * discount\n    else:\n        discount_amount = 0\n    final_price = (base_price - discount_amount) + tax_amount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final_price is observed to decrease, can we conclude that the base_price was reduced?",
  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention: A decrease in final_price could be due to several factors other than a decrease in base_price, such as an increase in the discount (if has_discount is True) or a decrease in the tax_rate. Therefore, without additional information, a decrease in final_price does not imply a decrease in base_price unambiguously.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "base_price → final_price; tax_rate → tax_amount; discount → discount_amount; has_discount → discount_amount; discount_amount → final_price; tax_amount → final_price; base_price → tax_amount; discount → final_price",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A decrease in base_price leads to a decrease in final_price, as does a decrease in discount, and an increase in discount_rate and has_discount also affect final_price through their influence on discount_amount and tax_amount, respectively."
