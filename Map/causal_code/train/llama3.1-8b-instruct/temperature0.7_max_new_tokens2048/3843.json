  "Explanation": "While a 'positive' trend in the results from analyze_data implies that the final data point is larger than the first, it does not necessarily reflect on the trend of the original unadjusted data since the normalization process can alter relations such that it only compares the starting and ending points of the dataset after adjustment.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
