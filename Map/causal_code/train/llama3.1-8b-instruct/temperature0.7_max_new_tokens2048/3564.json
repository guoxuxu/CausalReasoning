  "Problem": "Above Python Code\",\n\nIf rainfall and sunlight are artificially controlled to increase, will this lead to an increase in carnivore population?",
  "Explanation": "Controlling rainfall and sunlight positively affects plant growth, which in turn increases herbivore population due to greater food availability. A higher herbivore population can support a larger carnivore population.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "sunlight → photosynthesis; photosynthesis → plant growth; plant growth → herbivore population; herbivore population → carnivore population; rainfall → plant growth; rainfall → photosynthesis"
