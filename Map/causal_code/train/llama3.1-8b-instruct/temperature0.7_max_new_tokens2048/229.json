  "Problem": "`\nvar inputA = 10;\nvar inputB = 5;\nvar result = 0;\n\nfunction multiply(a, b) {\n  return a * b;\n}\n\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nfunction processInputs(a, b) {\n  var tempResult = multiply(a, b);\n  result = add(tempResult, a);\n  return result;\n}\n\nresult = processInputs(inputA, inputB);\nconsole.log(result);\n`,\n\nIf the value of inputA increases, will the value of result also increase, assuming inputB remains constant?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, result is calculated by multiplying inputA and inputB using the multiply function, and then adding inputA to the product in the add function. Increasing inputA will directly increase the multiplication result and also increase the operand in the subsequent addition. Therefore, as inputA increases while inputB remains constant, result will also increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
