  "Explanation": "Adding tasks only increases the task count if the system is ready (`systemReady == true`). If the system is not initialized (`systemReady == false`), the task count remains unchanged since the condition `systemReady ? newTasks : 0` results in 0.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
