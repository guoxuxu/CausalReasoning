  "Explanation": "The 'adjusted_index' is a function of age, weight, and activity level. Two individuals could have different ages and activity levels which compensate differences in weight. Thus, an identical 'adjusted_index' does not necessarily mean the same weight due to these confounding variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
