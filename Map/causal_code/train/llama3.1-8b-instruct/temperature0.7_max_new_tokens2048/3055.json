  "Explanation": "A 'High' risk profile indicates that the total funds exceed 100000, but this could be due to the initial investment amount itself being high, not necessarily from adding funds. Thus, there isn't a definitive reverse causal inference from the high risk profile to the action of adding a large amount of funds.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
