  "Explanation": "The message 'Order too large, cannot fulfill' indicates that an order exceeds available inventory at that time but does not provide information about the original inventory count. Changes in this message don't relate or infer the initial inventory, just the status relative to current inventory and the order size.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
