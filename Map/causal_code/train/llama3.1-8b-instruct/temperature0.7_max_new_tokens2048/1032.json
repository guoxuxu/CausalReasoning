  "Explanation": "In the code, the class Weather changes the attribute is_rainy to True when the temperature is below 20 degrees. Consequently, the function plan_outdoor_event will return 'Plan indoor events' when is_rainy is True, implying more indoor events will be planned in colder temperatures.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
