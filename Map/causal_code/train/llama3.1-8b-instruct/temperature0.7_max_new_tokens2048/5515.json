  "Problem": "def process_data(data, scale=1.0, offset=0.0):\n    modified_data = [(x * scale + offset) for x in data]\n    result_data = [y for y in modified_data if y > 0]\n    return result_data\n\ndata_list = [1, -2, 3, 4, -5]\nfinal_result = process_data(data_list, scale=2.0, offset=5.0)\",\n\nIf the scale parameter is increased, will the number of elements in final_result generally increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the scale parameter leads to elements in data_list being multiplied by a larger number, increasing their values before the offset is added. Higher resulting values mean fewer elements will be negative after the operation, thus more will remain after the filter (y > 0), increasing the size of final_result.",
