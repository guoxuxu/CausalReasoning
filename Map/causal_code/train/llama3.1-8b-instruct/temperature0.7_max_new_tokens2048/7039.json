  "Explanation": "Setting humidity to 60 and increasing temperature by external heat (temperature becomes 21) satisfies the conditions for 'Rainy' weather since the temperature will be over 20 and humidity over 50. It does not turn sunny unless the temperature exceeds 25.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
