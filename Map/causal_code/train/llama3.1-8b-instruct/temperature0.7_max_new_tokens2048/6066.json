  "Explanation": "In this case, if promotions lead to increased sales, we can infer that price was likely reduced because the relationship in the code increases customer visits when there is a promotion (price multiplied by 0.5), assuming the increase in customer visits is significant enough to outweigh the lower individual price in total sales computation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
