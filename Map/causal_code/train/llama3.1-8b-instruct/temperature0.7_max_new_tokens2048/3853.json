  "Explanation": "The weather status 'Moderate and Dry' implies that the humidity was below 30 due to manual setting or initialization. As per the code, 'Moderate' comes from a temperature between 10 and 30, and ' and Dry' from a humidity below 30. The causal intervention here would be setting the humidity below 30 during instantiation or update.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
