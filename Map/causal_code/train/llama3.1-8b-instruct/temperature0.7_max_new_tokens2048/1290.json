  "Explanation": "Changes in the result of analyze_data can be attributed to either modifications in the data input, normalization, or enhancement processes. Without specific information about interventions in other processes (like normalization), changes in analysis results cannot unequivocally point to modifications in the enhancement process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
