  "Explanation": "Although the investment increases in a 'bull' market, the increase in investment could also come from the invest_more method, which adds additional amounts to the investment regardless of market trend. Hence, an increase in investment does not necessarily mean that the market trend was 'bull'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
