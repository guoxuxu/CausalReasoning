  "Explanation": "A low result could occur under either condition. With the 'filter' flag, if all data points are non-positive, the sum would be zero. With the 'no_filter' flag, low or negative values in the data can also produce a low result after halving the sum. Hence, low result alone does not imply which flag was used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
