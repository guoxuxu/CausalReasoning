  "Problem": "int processOrder(int quantity, bool isMember) { if (isMember) { return quantity * 2; } else { return quantity; } }\",\n\nIf an order value is found to have doubled, was the user necessarily a member?",
  "Explanation": "Seeing the order value doubled does not conclusively indicate that the user is a member, because increasing the quantity without being a member could also increase the order value. Other factors like a non-member placing a larger order could result in increased order value, hence membership cannot be inferred directly without additional information on the quantity ordered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
