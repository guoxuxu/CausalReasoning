  "Explanation": "Lowering the threshold for health increase to 9000 steps means that during rainy days, where the step count can be as high as 7000, there's a higher probability that even a slightly above-average step count during a rainy day might increase health. This intervention makes it more likely for health to surpass 60, thus making happiness more probable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Lowering the step limit for health increase will not directly affect the likelihood of the person being happy during rainy days, but it may reduce the overall likelihood of being happy since it increases the likelihood of a decrease in health on rainy days."
