  "Explanation": "In the absence of an intervention, a reaction speed marked as 'high' directly results from the pressure condition being greater than 100, as per the provided conditions in the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
