  "Explanation": "The recalculation of 'average_sales' from a new 'total_sales' value only takes place when 'compute_average_sales' is deliberately called. The changed 'average_sales' directly follows from the execution of this method using the updated 'total_sales', showing a clear causal chain from intervention to effect.",
