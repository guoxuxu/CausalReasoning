  "Explanation": "Changing the discount strategy from `no_discount` to `percentage_discount` introduces a discount to the product price. A 20% discount on the price will reduce the `final_price_no_discount`, which will no longer apply no discount but a different strategy instead.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
