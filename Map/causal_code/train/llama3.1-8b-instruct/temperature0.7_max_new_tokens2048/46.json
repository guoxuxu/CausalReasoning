  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(balance, rate): \n    interest = balance * rate / 100 \n    return interest \n\nbalance = 5000 \nrate = 5 \ninterest = calculate_interest(balance, rate) \nbalance += interest\",\n\nIf the interest decreases, does it indicate a decrease in the balance?",
  "Explanation": "The interest calculation in the `calculate_interest` function is dependent only on the `balance` and the `rate`. A decrease in interest could be due to a decrease in the rate or an untouched balance. The balance is not influenced by the change in interest outright without other external adjustments; it does not automatically decrease when interest does.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
