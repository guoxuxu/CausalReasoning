  "Explanation": "An empty output list implies that no even numbers were processed; however, this does not necessarily mean the input list contained only odd numbers — it could also have been simply an empty list. So, an empty output list does not guarantee the input consisted of only odd numbers. Other inputs could have produced the same effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
