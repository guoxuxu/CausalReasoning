  "Explanation": "Removing the user existence check and unconditionally executing the update and notification actions means updating the user's last activity will always trigger a notification. The causal link between these events remains strong despite the intervention, although this could introduce errors or unintended behavior if the user ID does not actually exist.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
