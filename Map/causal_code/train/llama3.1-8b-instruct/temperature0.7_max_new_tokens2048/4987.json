  "Explanation": "Since the demand-supply gap widens favorably when demand increases, the initial price computation `max(0, demand - supply)` results in a higher base price. The code adjusts the price upward with `price *= 1.2` since supply does not exceed demand.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Demand directly causes price, and supply indirectly influences price by affecting it through its effect on the price multiplier."
