  "Problem": "def predict_sales(price, ad_budget, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        base_sales = 120\n    else:\n        base_sales = 100\n    adjusted_price_effect = price * -0.5\n    ad_effect = ad_budget * 0.4\n    total_sales = base_sales + adjusted_price_effect + ad_effect\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf after an intervention, we set the price very high and notice total_sales drop significantly, does it imply the season was high?",
  "Explanation": "While setting a high price would generally decrease total_sales due to the negative correlation, a significant drop does not conclusively indicate a high season. The drop could be so substantial due to a naturally lower base_sales in a 'low' season or insufficient ad_budget to counterbalance the high price effect.",
