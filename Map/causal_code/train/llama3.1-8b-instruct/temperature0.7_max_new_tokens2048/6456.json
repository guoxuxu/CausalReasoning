  "Problem": "[\n    \"# Python code demonstrating a case of technology sales forecasts and inventory management\",\n    \"def update_inventory(product, sales_forecast, current_inventory):\",\n    \"    units_sold_estimate = sales_forecast.get(product, 0)\",\n    \"    new_inventory = current_inventory - units_sold_estimate\",\n    \"    if new_inventory < 10:\",\n    \"        order_quantity = 50 - new_inventory\",\n    \"        place_order(product, order_quantity)\",\n    \"    return new_inventory\",\n    \n    \"def place_order(product, quantity):\",\n    \"    print(f'Order placed for {quantity} units of {product}')\",\n    \n    \"sales_forecasts = {'Smartphone': 25, 'Laptop': 15}\",\n    \"current_inventories = {'Smartphone': 40, 'Laptop': 30, 'Tablet': 20}\",\n    \"update_inventory('Smartphone', sales_forecasts, current_inventories['Smartphone'])\",\n    \"update_inventory('Laptop', sales_forecasts, current_inventories['Laptop'])\",\n    \"update_inventory('Tablet', sales_forecasts, current_inventories['Tablet'])\"\n  ],\n\nIf the 'order_quantity' is high, does it imply that 'units_sold_estimate' was also high?",
  "Explanation": "High 'order_quantity' results from having a low 'new_inventory', which is influenced by both 'units_sold_estimate' and the initial 'current_inventory'. A high 'order_quantity' does not necessarily trace directly back to a high 'units_sold_estimate' - it could also be due to a low starting 'current_inventory'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
