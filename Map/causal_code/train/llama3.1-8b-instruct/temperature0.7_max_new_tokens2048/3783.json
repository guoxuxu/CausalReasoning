  "Explanation": "While the 'decreaseTemperature' method decreases humidity by 20 units if the temperature falls below 18, humidity can also marginally increase or decrease through changes made by the 'increaseHeat' method based on the heating source, such as 'solar' or 'geothermal'. Therefore, a decrease in humidity alone does not guarantee a fall in temperature below 18 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
