  "Explanation": "Even though there's a dependency, final_result is influenced by processed_input, which in turn depends on raw_input. However, without specific evidence that raw_input was changed or processed differently (such as an indication in the code that it has decreased directly affecting the final_result), one cannot conclusively state that changes in raw_input led to the change in final_result. Other factors like modifications in process_data could also affect the final result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
