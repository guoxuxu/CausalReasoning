  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data):\n    if 'sales' in data and 'expenses' in data:\n        profit = sum(data['sales']) - sum(data['expenses'])\n        if profit > 1000:\n            performance = 'good'\n        elif profit > 0:\n            performance = 'average'\n        else:\n            performance = 'poor'\n        return profit, performance\n    else:\n        return None, 'incomplete data'\",\n\nIf we intervene by setting 'expenses' to zero, will this guarantee a 'performance' of 'good'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'expenses' to zero will definitely increase the 'profit'. However, whether the performance becomes 'good' depends on the sum of 'sales' being greater than 1000. Without knowing the sales figures, we can’t guarantee a 'good' performance.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
