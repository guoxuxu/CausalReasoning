  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, restock):\n    inventory = 100\n    for sale in sales:\n        inventory -= sale\n    for item in restock:\n        inventory += item\n    return inventory\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in inventory, and know there was no restocking, can we conclude that sales have decreased?",
  "Explanation": "If restocking is zero (intervention) and inventory increases, the only explanation under the given model is that the sales have decreased. This is because each element in 'sales' directly reduces the inventory, so less reduction (or negative reduction/return) would lead to inventory increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
