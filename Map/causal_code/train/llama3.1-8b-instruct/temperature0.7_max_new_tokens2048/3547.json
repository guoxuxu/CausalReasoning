  "Explanation": "Given that the discount is 0.25 and, per the code logic, basic discounts at ages ≤30 or >30 are 0.1 and 0.2 respectively, the only way this can increase to 0.25 is through the additional conditional operation specifically for 'new_customer's who receive an extra 0.05. This results from understanding the code effect to cause without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
