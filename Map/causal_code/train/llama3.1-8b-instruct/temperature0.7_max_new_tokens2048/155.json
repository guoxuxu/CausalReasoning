  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(balance, rate):\n    if balance < 0:\n        raise ValueError('Balance cannot be negative')\n    else:\n        interest = balance * (rate / 100)\n        return interest\n\nbalance = 1000\nrate = 5\ntry:\n    result = calculate_interest(balance, rate)\n    balance += result\nexcept ValueError as ve:\n    print(ve)\",\n\nIf we set the balance to positive, will the function return a calculated interest?",
  "Explanation": "The function returns a calculated interest if the balance is non-negative. Setting the balance to a positive value bypasses the error condition and hence allows the calculation of interest.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
