  "Problem": "class ShoppingCart { constructor() { this.items = []; this.total = 0; } addItem(item, price) { this.items.push({item: item, price: price}); this.updateTotal(); } removeItem(itemName) { this.items = this.items.filter(item => item.item !== itemName); this.updateTotal(); } updateTotal() { this.total = this.items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0); } applyDiscount(code) { if (code === 'SAVE10') { this.total *= 0.9; } else if (code === 'SAVE20') { this.total *= 0.8; } } }\",\n\nDoes adding an item to the shopping cart always increase the total price?",
  "Explanation": "The addItem method adds an item to the cart and then calls updateTotal which recalculates the total price by summing up the prices of all items, thereby increasing the total when a new item is added.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
