  "Explanation": "While applying a discount can lead to a decrease in final price, simply observing a decrease in final price cannot conclusively prove a discount was applied. The base price could have been directly decreased, or other factors might have played a role even without tax rate changes or new coupons.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
