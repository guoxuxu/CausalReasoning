  "Explanation": "As the condition for a fire includes the temperature being greater than 15°C, setting an artificial maximum temperature at or below 15°C will eliminate the temperature-based condition for fire occurrences. This intervention will likely result in fewer or no fire incidences, since one of the causal conditions (temperature > 15°C) is not met.",
