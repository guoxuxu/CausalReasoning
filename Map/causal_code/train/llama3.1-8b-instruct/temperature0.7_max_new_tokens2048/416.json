  "Explanation": "An increase in sales can also be attributed to other factors such as increased demand, insufficient stock control, or enhanced delivery, not just promotional pricing.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
