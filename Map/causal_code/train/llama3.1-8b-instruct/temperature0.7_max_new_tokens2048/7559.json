  "Explanation": "From the code, being sick or not depends on both being rested and taking medication. If a person takes medication and is still sick, then they are likely not rested. If they then rest, according to the code, they should no longer be sick. This question explores effect of getting rested (intervention) on the effect (sick status) starting from the cause (taking medication).",
