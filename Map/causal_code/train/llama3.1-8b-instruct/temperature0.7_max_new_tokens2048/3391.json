  "Problem": "def process_data(data, mode):\n    if mode == 'normalize':\n        max_val = max(data)\n        return [x / max_val for x in data]\n    elif mode == 'standardize':\n        mean_val = sum(data) / len(data)\n        std_dev = (sum((x - mean_val) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)) ** 0.5\n        return [(x - mean_val) / std_dev for x in data]\n    else:\n        return data\",\n\nIf the output data elements are all between 0 and 1, was the mode set to 'normalize'?",
  "Explanation": "Although the 'normalize' mode will result in the data elements being between 0 and 1, standardized data where mean is very small compared to the variance can also have all elements between 0 and 1. Thus, this condition does not necessarily imply the mode was 'normalize'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
