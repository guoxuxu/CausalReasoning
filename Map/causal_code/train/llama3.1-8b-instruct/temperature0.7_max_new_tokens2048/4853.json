  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting 'database_state' to 'inactive', the only possible returns from the function are 'delayed' if 'user_click' is True, and 'no_action' if 'user_click' is False. This scenario evaluates 'from cause to effect with intervention', where the intervention is altering the database state to 'inactive' showing the conditional impact on the outcomes based on 'user_click'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
