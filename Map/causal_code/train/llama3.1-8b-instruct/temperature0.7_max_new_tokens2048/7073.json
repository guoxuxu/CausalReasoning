  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\n    temperature = input_data['temp']\n    humidity = input_data['humidity']\n    adjusted_temp = temperature * 1.8 + 32\n    comfort_index = adjusted_temp - humidity\n    if humidity > 50:\n        risk_of_mold = True\n    else:\n        risk_of_mold = False\n    return {'adjusted_temp': adjusted_temp, 'comfort_index': comfort_index, 'risk_of_mold': risk_of_mold}\",\n\nDoes an increase in temperature directly increase the comfort index assuming no other changes?",
  "Explanation": "The comfort index is calculated by subtracting humidity from the adjusted temperature, which is directly derived from the temperature. Hence, without changing other variables, increasing the temperature will increase the adjusted temperature, thus increasing the comfort index.",
