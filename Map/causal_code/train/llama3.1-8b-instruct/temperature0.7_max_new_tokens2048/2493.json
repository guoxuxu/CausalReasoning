  "Explanation": "Intervening to change the status to 'Normal weight' implies changing the BMI to fall within 18.5 to 24.9. Adjusting the height alone might not guarantee this BMI range because it also depends significantly on the weight. To effectively change the status, you would generally need to adjust the weight or maintain an appropriate balance between weight and height.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
