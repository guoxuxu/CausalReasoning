  "Explanation": "For the output to be forcibly changed to 'Low', the result of 'process_data' must be ensured to be at or below 15. If 'x' were initially greater than 15, even in the minimal modification scenario where 'flag' is False, the addition of 10 to 'x' would still result in a value exceeding the threshold, contradicting the intervention's goal to make 'output' 'Low'. Thus, 'x' must not have been greater than 15.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
