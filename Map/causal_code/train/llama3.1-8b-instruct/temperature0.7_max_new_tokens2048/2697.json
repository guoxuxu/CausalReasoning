  "Explanation": "While the code does indeed specify that both the air conditioner and heater should be off if the temperature is within 18 to 25 degrees, the question involves an external intervention setting the temperature. However, no part of the code directly influences or changes the temperature; it only modifies the heater or air conditioner states based on temperature values. Therefore, an external intervention changing the temperature is not reflected in the heater or air conditioner states.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
