  "Explanation": "Casting a vote for a specific candidate by calling castVote increases both the count for that specific candidate in votesPerCandidate and the totalVotes. Thus, voting for a candidate directly affects the totalVotes counter.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
