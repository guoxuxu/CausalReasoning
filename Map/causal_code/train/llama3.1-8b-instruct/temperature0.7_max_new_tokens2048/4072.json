  "Explanation": "Intervening by manually changing the light statuses does not alter the internal state tracking of the machine. Since the machine's state tracking will still operate based on its state variable transitions (unaware of the manual intervention), the command 'NEXT' will not necessarily turn the green light on unless the state variable matches the prerequisites for that transition.",
