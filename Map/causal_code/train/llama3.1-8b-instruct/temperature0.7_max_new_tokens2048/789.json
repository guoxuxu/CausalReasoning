  "Problem": "Provided above\",\n\nBy observing changes in the 'final_total', can one determine specifically which items were removed from the cart?",
  "Explanation": "Changes in 'final_total' reflect changes in the cumulative price, but do not provide specific information on which items were removed, only that the total price was reduced by the sum of the prices of removed items.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
