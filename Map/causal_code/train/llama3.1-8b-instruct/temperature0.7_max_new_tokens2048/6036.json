  "Problem": "int calculate(int x, int y) { \n   int t1 = x * y; \n   int t2 = t1 + 10; \n   if (t1 > 50) { \n     t2 += 5; \n   } \n   return t2; \n }\",\n\nIf t2 increases, can we conclude that x has necessarily increased without altering other variables?",
  "Explanation": "t2 can increase due to several reasons independent of x. An increase in y or satisfying the condition (t1 > 50), thus adding more to t2, can occur without changes in x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
