  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, season):\n    if season == 'holiday':\n        discount_rate += 0.05\n    final_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate)\n    tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate\n    total_price = final_price + tax_amount\n    return total_price\",\n\nIf the total price is observed to increase, can we conclude that the base price definitely increased?",
  "Explanation": "A rise in total price can be caused not only by an increase in base price but also due to changes in other variables such as the tax rate, or a reduction in the discount rate. Therefore, observing an increase in total price does not allow us to definitively conclude that the base price increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
