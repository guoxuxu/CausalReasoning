  "Explanation": "Raining could be triggered either by directly setting the rain status to true, which also decreases the temperature by 5 degrees, or by reducing the temperature manually to 15 or less. It doesn't necessarily indicate that temperature was manually set to below 15 prior to the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
