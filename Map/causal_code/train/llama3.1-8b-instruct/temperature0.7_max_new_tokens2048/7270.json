  "Problem": "class School { constructor(students, teachers) { this.students = students; this.teachers = teachers; this.performance = this.calculatePerformance(); } calculatePerformance() { return (this.teachers.length > 0) ? this.students.length / this.teachers.length : 0; } increaseTeachers(num) { this.teachers.length += num; this.performance = this.calculatePerformance(); } } let mySchool = new School(400, 20); mySchool.increaseTeachers(5);\",\n\nIf the performance index has increased, does it necessarily mean the number of students has increased?",
  "Explanation": "A higher performance index could be due to either an increase in the number of students or a decrease in the number of teachers, or both. Therefore, an increase in performance alone doesn't necessarily indicate an increase in the number of students.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
