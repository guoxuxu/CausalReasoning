  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: The discount is 0% for items that are not electronics on days other than Wednesday. Changing to 'Clothing' does not change the causal interpretation related to the day based on the observed discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
