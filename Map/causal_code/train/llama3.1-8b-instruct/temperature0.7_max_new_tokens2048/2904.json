  "Explanation": "Reducing expenses increases profit_before_tax (since profit_before_tax = revenue - expenses). This increase will result in a higher net_profit, hence final_profit increases, assuming revenue and tax_rate are held constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
