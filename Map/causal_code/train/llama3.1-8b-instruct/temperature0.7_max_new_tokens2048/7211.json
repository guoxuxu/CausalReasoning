  "Explanation": "While manually setting the temperature to 30 increases the chances of returning 'Hot and sunny', it does not guarantee this outcome unless isRainy is set to false. If isRainy is true regardless of the temperature, the output cannot be 'Hot and sunny'. This tests understanding from cause to effect with intervention, where the full conditions needed for a particular outcome must be considered.",
