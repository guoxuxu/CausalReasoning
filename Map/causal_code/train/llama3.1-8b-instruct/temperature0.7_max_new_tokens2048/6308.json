  "Explanation": "Health staying at 100 could be due to several reasons: no damage was dealt (damage amount is 0), the health was already at full capacity before taking damage, or the ActivateImmunity method was indeed invoked. Without observing the change of the immunity state directly or knowing the context of damage, we cannot conclusively attribute the effect to that cause.",
