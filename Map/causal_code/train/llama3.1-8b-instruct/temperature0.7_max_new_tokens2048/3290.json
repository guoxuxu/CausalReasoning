  "Explanation": "The `temperature` inside the control system increases not just from the heater being automatically turned on due to the temperature being below 20 but also because the `temperature` is directly modified by the difference `external_temp - 20`. Thus, if `external_temp` goes up, the corresponding term `(external_temp - 20)` becomes larger, directly increasing the `temperature` even without the heater's influence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
