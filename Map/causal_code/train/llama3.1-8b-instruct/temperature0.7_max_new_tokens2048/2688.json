  "Problem": "def update_scores(scores, bonus, penalty, is_winner):\n    if is_winner:\n        new_scores = [score + bonus for score in scores]\n    else:\n        new_scores = [score - penalty if score > penalty else 0 for score in scores]\n    return new_scores\",\n\nIf we manipulate the 'is_winner' variable to always be True, will 'new_scores' always be more than or equal to the original scores?",
  "Explanation": "Manipulating 'is_winner' to always be True ensures that the 'new_scores' are calculated by adding a 'bonus' to the original 'scores'. Since adding a bonus (which could be zero or positive) cannot result in a score lesser than the original, 'new_scores' will always be equal to or more than the original scores.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
