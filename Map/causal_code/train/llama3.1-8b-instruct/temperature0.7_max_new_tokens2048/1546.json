  "Explanation": "Resetting consumption to zero effectively means no energy is needed, which implies that prior to the reset, the available energy (from either solar or battery) was at least sufficient to meet the original consumption needs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
