  "Explanation": "Though increasing the temperature can lead to reduced humidity, the decrease in reported humidity could be purely from manual adjustments (calling adjust_humidity directly) or setting it through increase_humidity. There might be no direct relationship between the observed humidity and prior temperature changes in this scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
