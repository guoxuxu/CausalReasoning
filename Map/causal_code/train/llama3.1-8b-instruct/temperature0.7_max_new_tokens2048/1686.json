  "Problem": "def compute_scores(temperature, pressure):\n    if temperature > 100:\n        score = 20\n    else:\n        score = 10\n    if pressure > 5:\n        score += 15\n    else:\n        score += 5\n    return score\",\n\nGiven the score was manually set to 25 by intervention, can we deduce the pressure was definitely higher than 5?",
  "Explanation": "Score of 25 could result from temperature being beyond 100 degrees (score = 20) with pressure <= 5 (score += 5) or temperature <= 100 degrees (score = 10) with pressure > 5 (score += 15). Both scenarios result in a score of 25.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
