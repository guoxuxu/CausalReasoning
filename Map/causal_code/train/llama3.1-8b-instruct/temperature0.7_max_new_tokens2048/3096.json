  "Explanation": "Increasing the fuel_capacity allows more fuel to be stored in the vehicle, hence enabling it to travel longer distances without the need for additional refueling, assuming other conditions like fuel consumption rates stay constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
