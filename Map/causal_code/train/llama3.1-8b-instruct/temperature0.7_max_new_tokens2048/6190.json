  "Problem": "{\n        \"python\": [\n            \"def calculate_temperature(feels_like, humidity, umbrella_used):\",\n            \"    base_temperature = feels_like - 0.3 * humidity\",\n            \"    if umbrella_used:\",\n            \"        sensed_temperature = base_temperature + 2\",\n            \"    else:\",\n            \"        sensed_temperature = base_temperature\",\n            \"    return sensed_temperature\"\n        ]\n    },\n\nIf the sensed temperature is higher than the feels_like temperature, can we conclude that an umbrella was definitely used?",
  "Explanation": "A higher sensed temperature can result not just from using an umbrella but also from a combination of lower humidity and higher feels_like temperature, which could also result in a higher base_temperature and thus sensed_temperature without involving an umbrella.",
