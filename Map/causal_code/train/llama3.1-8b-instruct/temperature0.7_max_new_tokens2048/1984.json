  "Explanation": "Given that there are no withdrawals and an increase is observed in the balance, the logical inference under these circumstances is that a deposit operation was performed with a sufficient amount to exceed any potential previous balance, achieving the observed increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
