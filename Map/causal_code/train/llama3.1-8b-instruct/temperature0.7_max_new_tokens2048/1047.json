  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  if 'age' in data:\n    data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n  if 'income' in data and data['is_adult']:\n    data['tax_bracket'] = 'high' if data['income'] > 50000 else 'low'\n  return data\",\n\nIf the 'tax_bracket' is 'low', can we intervene and set the 'age' to less than 18 to make sure that the 'tax_bracket' remains 'low'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the 'age' under 18 will set 'is_adult' to false, which makes the tax_bracket determination irrelevant as there is no condition checking 'tax_bracket' for non-adults. This means that changing age does not guarantee 'tax_bracket' remains 'low', instead, 'tax_bracket' may not be set at all due to not being an adult.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
