  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(weather, holiday, discount): \n  if weather == 'sunny':\n    mood = 'happy'\n  else:\n    mood = 'normal'\n  if holiday:\n    free_time = 2\n  else:\n    free_time = 1\n  if discount:\n    spending_power = 1.5\n  else:\n    spending_power = 1\n  sales = (mood == 'happy') * free_time * spending_power\n  return sales\",\n\nIf we provide a discount, will this intervention guarantee higher sales regardless of the weather?",
  "Explanation": "While providing a discount raises spending power which can positively impact sales, the final amount of sales also depends on the weather (affecting the mood) and whether it is a holiday (affecting free time). Thus, higher sales are probable but not guaranteed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
