  "Explanation": "The method water_plants returns 'No need to water plants' only when is_raining is set to True. According to the update_weather method, is_raining becomes True when humidity is above 85 and temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
