  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, volume, tax_rate): \n    tax_amount = price * volume * tax_rate \n    total_sales = (price * volume) + tax_amount \n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf total_sales increase, does it imply that price has necessarily increased?",
  "Explanation": "While an increase in price will result in an increase in total_sales, the converse is not necessarily true. An increase in total_sales can also be caused by an increase in volume or an increase in tax_rate. Therefore, an increase in total_sales does not imply that the price has necessarily increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
