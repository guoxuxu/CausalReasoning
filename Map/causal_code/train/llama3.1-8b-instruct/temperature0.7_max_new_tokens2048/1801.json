  "Explanation": "The update_temperature function checks if external_temp is below the threshold. If it is, the is_heating_on flag is set to True and the temperature is increased by 2 units, representing the effect of the heating system being activated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
