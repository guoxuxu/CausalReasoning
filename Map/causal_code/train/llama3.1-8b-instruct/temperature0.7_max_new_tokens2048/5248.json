  "Explanation": "A bonus of 500 can be issued under two circumstances: Sales above 50000 with an attendance rate below 0.95 (mid-tier bonus for high sales), or sales between 20001 and 50000 with an attendance rate above 0.90. Hence, knowing the bonus alone does not precisely inform us of the sales range.",
