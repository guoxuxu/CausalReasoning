  "Explanation": "In the given code, the method 'forecast' in the 'Weather' class outputs 'Warm' when the temperature is above 20 degrees. Following the logic in the 'Person' class method 'feel', if the forecast is 'Warm', John will feel 'Happy'. Thus, without any other interventions, a temperature increase above 20 directly causes John to feel 'Happy'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
