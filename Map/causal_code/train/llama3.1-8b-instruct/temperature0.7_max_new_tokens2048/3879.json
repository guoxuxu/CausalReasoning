  "Explanation": "Though the `offer_job` function primarily employs individuals who are in good health, the `health_program` function potentially alters the health status of unemployed individuals to good, which means an individual could initially have poor health, be made healthy by the health program, and subsequently get a job. Thus, being employed does not strictly imply that the person's initial health was good.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
