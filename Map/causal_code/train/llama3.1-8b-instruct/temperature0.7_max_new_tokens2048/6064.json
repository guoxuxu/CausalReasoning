  "Problem": "class SalesPrediction { \n    double price; \n    int customerVisits;\n    public SalesPrediction(double price, int promoHeld) { \n        this.price = price; \n        this.customerVisits = promoHeld == 1 ? (int)(price * 0.5) : (int)(price * 1.2); \n    }\n    public double predictSales() { \n        return price * customerVisits; \n    }\n}\",\n\nIf the recorded sales are higher, can we conclude the price was definitely set higher?",
  "Explanation": "Higher sales do not directly imply a higher price since an increase in customer visits, possibly resulting from promotions or other factors, could also lead to higher sales despite the price. There is not a strict one-directional causal relationship between price and sales in this context.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
