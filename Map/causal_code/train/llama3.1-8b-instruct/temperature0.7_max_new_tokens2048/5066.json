  "Explanation": "While receiving a shipment of more than 50 bikes does improve satisfaction, smaller shipments do not decrease satisfaction and could also occur along with other satisfaction-improving factors such as specials, promotions, or external events. Thus, an increase in satisfaction alone does not necessarily indicate that a large shipment was recently received.",
