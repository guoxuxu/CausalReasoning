  "Problem": "def analyze_data(data):\n    if 'sales' in data and 'expenses' in data:\n        profit = data['sales'] - data['expenses']\n        if profit > 50000:\n            data['profitable'] = True\n        else:\n            data['profitable'] = False\n    if 'profitable' in data and data['profitable']:\n        data['invest_more'] = True\n    else:\n        data['invest_more'] = False\n    return data\",\n\nIf an external intervention sets 'expenses' to zero, will it influence whether the company is marked 'profitable'?",
  "Explanation": "By setting 'expenses' to zero through an intervention, the 'profit' equals 'sales', which would significantly increase or guarantee that profit is at least as much as sales. Since profitability is determined if profit exceeds 50000, reducing expenses to zero should logically make achieving this threshold easier, thus affecting the 'profitable' status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
