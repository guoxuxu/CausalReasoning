  "Explanation": "In the original code, Alex's ability to purchase items is contingent on having enough budget. Increasing the budget will enable him to handle more or pricier items (assuming pricing remains constant per item). This test requires understanding the relationship of budget size to purchasing power without intervention in item addition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
