  "Explanation": "When a specific value is found in a cookie, it implies that the `setCookie` method was invoked to establish this cookie with that explicit value. Although it's also possible for cookies to be set via other client or server-side scripts, the code provided makes clear the process for cookie creation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
