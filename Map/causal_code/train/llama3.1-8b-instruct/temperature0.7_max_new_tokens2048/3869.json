  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\n    noisy_data = input_data + 10\n    filtered_data = noisy_data - 5\n    processed_data = filtered_data * 2\n    return processed_data\",\n\nDoes altering processed_data's final calculation method impact input_data?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the final calculation of processed_data (e.g., changing the multiplication factor) will only affect the output based on given input_data and doesn't retrospectively modify the input_data. Input data remains unchanged regardless of how processed_data is calculated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
