  "Problem": "def calculate_performance(sales, expenses):\n    net_profit = sales - expenses\n    roi = (net_profit / expenses) * 100\n    return roi\n\nsales_data = [200, 500, 700]\nexpenses_data = [50, 150, 200]\nperformance_scores = []\nfor sales, expenses in zip(sales_data, expenses_data):\n    score = calculate_performance(sales, expenses)\n    if score > 30:\n        performance_scores.append({\"sales\": sales, \"score\": score})\",\n\nIf we set a mandatory minimum expense limit, will the impact on performance scores be predictable?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a minimum expense limit can potentially reduce the performance scores if it forces higher expenses without a proportional increase in sales. Since the ROI is dependent on the ratio of net profit to expenses, increasing expenses while keeping sales constant or not adequately increasing will lower performance scores.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
