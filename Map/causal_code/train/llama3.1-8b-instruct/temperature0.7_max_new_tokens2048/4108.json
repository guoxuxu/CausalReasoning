  "Explanation": "Introducing a mandatory minimum age (e.g., setting all ages below a certain number to some default value) does not inherently require changing how greetings are formatted for minors, as the current code handles under-18 appropriately by the existing logic without 'Mr.'",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
