  "Explanation": "Setting isRainy to false manually and seeing the umbrella close does not provide any information about the original temperature since the rain status was altered independently of temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
