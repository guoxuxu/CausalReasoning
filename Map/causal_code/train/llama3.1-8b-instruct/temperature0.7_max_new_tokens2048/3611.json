  "Explanation": "In the logic of determine_weather_status, a 'Hot and Humid' status is explicitly returned only when the temperature is greater than 30 degrees Celsius. Since this is the only condition under which 'Hot and Humid' is returned, observing this effect implies that the cause (temperature above 30) was present.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
