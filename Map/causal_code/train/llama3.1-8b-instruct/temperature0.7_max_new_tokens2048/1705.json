  "Problem": "Python code snippet provided above\",\n\nIf you intervene by setting a higher eating_rate for herbivores, will this result in a higher herbivore_population?",
  "Explanation": "Directly increasing the eating_rate allows herbivores to increase their population more efficiently if food (plants) is available, as dictated by the feed_herbivores method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "herbivore_population → food_available; food_available → eating_rate; eating_rate → herbivore_population; eating_rate → herbivore_population"
