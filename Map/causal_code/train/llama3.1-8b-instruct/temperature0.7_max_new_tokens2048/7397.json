  "Problem": "class WeatherSystem { double temperature; boolean rain; void updateWeather(double temp_change, boolean new_rain_condition) { temperature += temp_change; if (temperature < 60) { rain = true; } else if (temperature > 80) { rain = false; } rain = new_rain_condition; } }\",\n\nIf temp_change is positive, does that mean rain will certainly not occur?",
  "Explanation": "A positive temp_change does not guarantee that rain will not occur, because the rain state is ultimately set based on new_rain_condition, regardless of the temperature update. Moreover, the impact of the temperature passing certain thresholds (60 or 80) could also have modified the rain condition beforehand.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A positive temp_change directly causes an increase in temperature, which in turn directly causes rain, but a positive temp_change does not guarantee rain as it also depends on the initial temperature and new rain condition."
