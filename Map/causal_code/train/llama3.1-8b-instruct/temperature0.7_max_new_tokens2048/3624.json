  "Explanation": "Applying higher discounts lowers product prices, potentially allowing the user to add more or different products within the constraints of their unchanged balance. This scenario tests intervention (admin applies discounts) and its effect on cart composition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
