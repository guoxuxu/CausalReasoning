  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, tax_rate, discount, quantity):\n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate\n    discount_amount = price * discount\n    final_price = (price + tax_amount - discount_amount) * quantity\n    return final_price\n\nsales = calculate_sales(100, 0.07, 0.05, 50)\",\n\nIf the discount rate increases, will the final sales value decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount rate decreases the discount_amount, which decreases the final_price when multiplied by the quantity. Therefore, the final sales value decreases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the discount rate increases, then the discount amount increases, which in turn decreases the final price, resulting in a decrease in final sales value."
