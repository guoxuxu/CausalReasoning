  "Problem": "def ecosystem_model(predators, prey, resources):\n    if resources > 50:\n        prey_growth_rate = 0.1\n    else:\n        prey_growth_rate = 0.02\n\n    prey += prey * prey_growth_rate\n    predator_consumption_rate = 0.05 * predators\n\n    if predators > 30:\n        predator_death_rate = 0.1\n    else:\n        predator_death_rate = 0.02\n\n    resources_consumed = predators * predator_consumption_rate\n    resources -= resources_consumed\n    predators -= predators * predator_death_rate\n    predators += 0.02 * prey\n    return predators, prey, resources\",\n\nIf resources are artificially increased, will the predator population eventually increase, given the mechanisms in the code?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing resources directly raises the growth rate of prey (assuming resources exceed specified threshold). An increased prey population provides more food for predators, thereby potentially increasing the predator population, assuming other conditions (like predator death rates) remain constant. Therefore, intervention by increasing resources leads to increased prey, which can increase predators.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
