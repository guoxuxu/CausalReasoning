  "Problem": "def update_temperature(sensor_reading, adjustment_factor=1.05):\n    if sensor_reading > 100:\n        temperature = (sensor_reading * adjustment_factor) + 5\n    elif sensor_reading <= 100 and sensor_reading >= 50:\n        temperature = sensor_reading * adjustment_factor\n    else:\n        temperature = sensor_reading - 10\n    return temperature\n\nsensor_value = 110\nadjusted_temperature = update_temperature(sensor_value)\",\n\nIf the adjusted_temperature is observed to increase, can we conclude the sensor_value has increased?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, just observing an increase in the adjusted_temperature does not necessarily mean the sensor_value has increased because other factors such as changes in the adjustment_factor or the conditions that categorize the temperature calculation could also impact the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in sensor_value leads to an increase in sensor_reading, which in turn causes an increase in temperature, resulting in an increase in adjusted_temperature."
