  "Problem": "{\n    \"Code\": \"class HealthMonitor {\n  int steps;\n  int heartRate;\n  int waterIntake; // in milliliters\n\n  HealthMonitor(int steps, int heartRate, int waterIntake) {\n    this.steps = steps;\n    this.heartRate = heartRate;\n    this.waterIntake = waterIntake;\n  }\n\n  void updateSteps(int steps) {\n    this.steps += steps;\n    if (steps > 10000) this.heartRate += 5;\n  }\n\n  void drinkWater(int ml) {\n    this.waterIntake += ml;\n  }\n\n  boolean isHealthy() {\n    return this.heartRate < 100 && this.waterIntake >= 2000;\n  }\n}\n\"\n  },\n\nIf we manually increase someone's water intake by 2000 ml, will it guarantee that they are considered healthy under the `isHealthy` method?",
  "Explanation": "The `isHealthy` method checks both heart rate and water intake. Even if the water intake is increased by 2000 ml, a heart rate below 100 is also required to be considered healthy. The intervention on water intake alone doesn't ensure overall health status as determined by the method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
