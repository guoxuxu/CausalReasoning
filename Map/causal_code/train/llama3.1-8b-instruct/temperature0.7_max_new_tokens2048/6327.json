  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, coupon_code):\n    if coupon_code == 'SUMMER20':\n        discount = 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == 'WINTER10':\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0\n    final_price = price - (price * discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the 'coupon_code' provided is 'SUMMER20', will the 'final_price' be lower than the initial 'price'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'coupon_code' to 'SUMMER20' causes the 'discount' to be set at 0.2 (20%). This discount is applied to the 'price', reducing the 'final_price' by 20% of the original price, thus guaranteeing 'final_price' is lower than the initial 'price'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Coupon code influences discount, and discount influences final price, so final price is lower than the initial price when coupon code is 'SUMMER20'."
