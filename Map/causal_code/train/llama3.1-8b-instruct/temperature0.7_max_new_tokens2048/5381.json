  "Explanation": "The question inaccurately requires a 'yes/no' answer but implies a consequence requiring a measurement ('increase' or 'decrease'). However, technically speaking, raising the threshold for adulthood from 18 to 21 decreases the number of rows identified as 'is_adult', because fewer individuals will meet the new criterion. This is an effect caused directly by the intervention in the code logic.",
