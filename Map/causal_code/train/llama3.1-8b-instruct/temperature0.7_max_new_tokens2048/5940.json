  "Explanation": "A decrease in health_score could result from a decline in any of the three factors: environmental_quality, healthcare_funding, or public_awareness. Without specific information about changes in the other two factors, one cannot conclusively infer a decrease in healthcare funding just from a decrease in health_score.",
