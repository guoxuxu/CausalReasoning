  "Explanation": "Calling the makeItRain method forces it to rain regardless of the initial temperature value. Therefore, even if it was not raining due to a previous condition (like low temperature), this intervention makes it independent of the original temperature. The temperature could have been above 5 when makeItRain was called.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
