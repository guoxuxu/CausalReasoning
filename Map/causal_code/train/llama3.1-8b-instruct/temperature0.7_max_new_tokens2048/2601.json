  "Explanation": "Changing the 'result' to 'hot' without naturally passing through the if condition does not provide reliable information about the original temperatures as the alteration bypasses the logical condition of the code. Hence, we can’t infer that the original temperatures all exceeded 75 based on the forced result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
