  "Explanation": "If 'active' is false and 'heartRate' is greater than 100, the method 'isAtRisk()' will return true, indicating the person is at risk. This relationship is direct from cause (high heartRate) to effect (being at risk), without any external intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
