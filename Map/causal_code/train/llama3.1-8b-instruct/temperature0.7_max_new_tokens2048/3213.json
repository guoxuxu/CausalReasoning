  "Problem": "int main() {\n  int traffic = 0;\n  int lights = 1; // 0 is red, 1 is green, 2 is yellow\n  bool accident = false;\n  if (lights == 0) {\n    traffic = 1; // 0 is smooth, 1 is heavy\n  } else if (lights == 1) {\n    traffic = 0;\n  } else if (lights == 2) {\n    traffic = 1;\n  }\n  if (traffic == 1) {\n    accident = true;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\",\n\nIf you observe less traffic, can you conclude the traffic light was green without checking the light?",
  "Explanation": "Light settings also include yellow which results in heavy traffic, similar to red, but not necessarily only green causes smooth traffic. Hence, observing less traffic doesn't definitively imply that the traffic light was green, as this effect might have been manually intervened or there are other unconsidered factors in this hypothetical scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
