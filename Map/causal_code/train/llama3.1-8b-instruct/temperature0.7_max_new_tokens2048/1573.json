  "Problem": "class WeatherTracker { var weatherType: String = 'sunny' func updateWeather(t: String) { weatherType = t } func shouldTakeUmbrella() -> Bool { return weatherType == 'rainy' } }\",\n\nIf a new method changePredictedPrecipitation is introduced to increase the chance of rain but doesn't directly alter weatherType, and it's called before updateWeather('rainy'), does shouldTakeUmbrella still return true?",
  "Explanation": "Since changePredictedPrecipitation does not directly alter weatherType and shouldTakeUmbrella's return value solely depends on weatherType being 'rainy' (which is set by updateWeather), the return value of shouldTakeUmbrella remains true if followed by updateWeather('rainy'), regardless of the new method's execution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
