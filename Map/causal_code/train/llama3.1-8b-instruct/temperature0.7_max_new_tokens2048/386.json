  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { constructor() { this.weather = 'sunny'; this.temperature = 25; } updateWeather(weather) { this.weather = weather; if (weather === 'rainy') { this.temperature -= 5; } else if (weather === 'sunny') { this.temperature += 5; } } } const simulator = new WeatherSimulator(); simulator.updateWeather('rainy');\",\n\nIf the temperature decreased, was the previous weather necessarily 'sunny'?",
  "Explanation": "Although the temperature decreases when the weather changes to 'rainy', it's not valid to conclude that the previous state was necessarily 'sunny'. The temperature can decrease from any previous state whenever the weather changes to 'rainy' according to the 'updateWeather' method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
