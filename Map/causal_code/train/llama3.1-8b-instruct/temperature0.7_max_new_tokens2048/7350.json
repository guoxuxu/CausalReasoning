  "Explanation": "The function assigns 'high' only when 'value' is greater than 50. Therefore, observing 'high' in results implies the 'value' was above this threshold.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
