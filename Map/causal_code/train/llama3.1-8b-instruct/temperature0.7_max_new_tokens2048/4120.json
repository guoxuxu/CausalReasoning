  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(store_area, competitors_nearby):\n    if competitors_nearby > 3:\n        base_sales = 200\n    else:\n        base_sales = 300\n    enhanced_store_area = store_area ** 0.5\n    predicted_sales = base_sales + (50 * enhanced_store_area)\n    return predicted_sales\",\n\nIf we intervene by setting the base_sales to 400 irrespective of the competitors, and the competitors nearby decrease from 4 to 2, will there be an increase in predicted_sales?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention fixes the base_sales at 400, decoupling it from the influence of competitors_nearby defined in the if-else condition. Hence, changes in the number of competitors will no longer affect the predicted_sales, since the base_sales component of the predicted_sales equation remains constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
