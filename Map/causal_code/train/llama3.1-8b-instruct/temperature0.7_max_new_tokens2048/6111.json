  "Explanation": "From the 'student_grades' function, increasing the hours_studied while maintaining attendance >75 (i.e., 80) retains the performance boost at 0.1. Since the original hours_studied already crossed the threshold for a study boost (i.e., 5 hours), increasing it further keeps the study boost unchanged at 0.2. Therefore, the final_grade calculation remains the same (no additional increases from the increase in hours beyond the threshold).",
