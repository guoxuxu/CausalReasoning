  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data):\n  discounts = data['discount'] > 20\n  weekend = data['day'].isin(['Saturday', 'Sunday'])\n  high_sales = data['sales'] > 500\n  if discounts and weekend:\n    increase = 0.15 * data['sales']\n  else:\n    increase = 0.05 * data['sales']\n  data['forecast_sales'] = data['sales'] + increase\n  return data\",\n\nIf there are no discounts, will the forecast_sales always be lower than when there are discounts?",
  "Explanation": "Forecast_sales could be higher without discounts if it's not a weekend. The increase in sales without discounts is consistently at 5%, but being a non-weekend day could still yield higher absolute forecast sales compared to a discounted, weekend scenario due to potential higher baseline sales.",
