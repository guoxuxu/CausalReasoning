If humidity decreases, did the temperature necessarily drop below 18 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "No, because the humidity is being adjusted by an external agent independently of temperature changes governed by the system's internal code logic. In this scenario, a decrease in humidity shouldn't be taken as evidence that the temperature has dropped below 18, as it could be influenced by other factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
