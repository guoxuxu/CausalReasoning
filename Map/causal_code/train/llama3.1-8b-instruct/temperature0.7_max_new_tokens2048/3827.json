  "Problem": "def process_data(data, condition): \n    if condition == 'A': \n        result = sum(data) + 10 \n    elif condition == 'B': \n        result = sum(data) - 5 \n    else: \n        result = sum(data) * 2 \n    return result\",\n\nIf the result observed is higher than the sum of data, can we conclude the condition must have been 'A'?",
  "Explanation": "Even though the condition 'A' does result in a higher sum (sum of the data + 10), the appearance of a higher result does not exclusively indicate 'A' as the condition. Condition 'C' multiplies the sum of the data by 2, which could also lead to a result higher than the sum, depending on the actual data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
