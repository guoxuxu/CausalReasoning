  "Problem": "class Employee { constructor(name, performanceRating, salary) { this.name = name; this.performanceRating = performanceRating; this.salary = salary; } updateSalary(percentIncrease) { this.salary += this.salary * percentIncrease / 100; } } const john = new Employee('John Doe', 85, 50000); function reviewPerformance(employee) { let newRating; if (employee.performanceRating > 80) { newRating = employee.performanceRating + 5; employee.updateSalary(10); } else { newRating = employee.performanceRating + 2; } employee.performanceRating = Math.min(newRating, 100); } reviewPerformance(john);\",\n\nInitiating a review of John's performance results in a salary increase. If we prevent this review, will his salary remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The `reviewPerformance` function is the causal mechanism for changing John's salary, as it conditions salary adjustments (i.e., 10% increase) on the performance rating being over 80. Preventing this review would mean this condition is never checked or met, thus leaving his salary unchanged.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
