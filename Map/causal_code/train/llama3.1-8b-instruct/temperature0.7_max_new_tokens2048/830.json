  "Explanation": "The 'apply_discount' method multiplies the 'total' by (1 - discount), reducing it. This inference holds as the discount logic directly causes the reduction when a positive, non-zero discount less than 100% is applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
