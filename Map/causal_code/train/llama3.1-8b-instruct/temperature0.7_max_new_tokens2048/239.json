  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data.get('x', 0)\n    y = x * 2\n    data['y'] = y\n    z = y + 10\n    data['z'] = z\n    return data\",\n\nIf you manually set 'y' to a value outside this function before 'z' is calculated, would this impact the final value of 'z' computed by the function?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'z' is directly dependent on the value of 'y' in the expression 'y + 10', any manual modification to 'y' before it's used to calculate 'z' will directly influence the outcome value of 'z'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
