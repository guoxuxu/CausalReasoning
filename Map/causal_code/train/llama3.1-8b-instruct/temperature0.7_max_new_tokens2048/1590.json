  "Explanation": "Reduction in remainingStock indicates more units have been sold, but it does not necessarily mean a discount was introduced. Other factors like increased demand could cause this. Thus, it cannot reliably indicate whether a discount was launched. This question investigates the inference from effect to cause with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
