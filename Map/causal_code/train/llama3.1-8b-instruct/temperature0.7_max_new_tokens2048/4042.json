  "Explanation": "The method `willFeelCold()` checks if the temperature is below 15 and it is not raining to return true (feeling cold). The given conditions directly match this scenario without any other interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
