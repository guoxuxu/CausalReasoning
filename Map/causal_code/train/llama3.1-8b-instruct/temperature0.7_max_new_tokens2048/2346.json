  "Explanation": "The observation of the category turning to 'Adult' post-intervention does not necessarily indicate that the original mean was below 30. The intervention could have changed the statistical properties of the age data significantly regardless of its original state, leading to the new categorization as 'Adult'. Thus, the original mean age cannot be conclusively determined just from the effect of the intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
