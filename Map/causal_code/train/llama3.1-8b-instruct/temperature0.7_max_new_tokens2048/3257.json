  "Explanation": "As 'fever' being true initially is unrelated to the established intervention of manually setting 'body_temperature' to 36.5. This also resets any natural progression of temperature changes influenced by external factors. We can't conclusively trace back the cause of the initial fever to external temperature alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
