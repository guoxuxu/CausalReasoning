  "Explanation": "John’s decision not to wear a coat is affected by the feels_like temperature, which is a combination of actual temperature and humidity. Therefore, even with a moderate actual temperature, a high humidity can result in a higher feels_like temperature, leading to a decision to not wear a coat.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
