  "Problem": "class Employee { constructor(name, isManager) { this.name = name; this.isManager = isManager; this.salary = isManager ? 5000 : 3000; } updateSalary(increment) { if (this.isManager) { this.salary += increment * 1.2; } else { this.salary += increment; } } reportIssue() { if (!this.isManager) { return 'issue reported'; } else { return 'resolve issue directly'; } } }\",\n\nIf an Employee instance has a salary of 5000, does this mean the employee is definitely a manager?",
  "Explanation": "While initial salary setting logic in the constructor indicates that managers start with a salary of 5000, an employee's salary can also be increased to 5000 or above through other methods such as the `updateSalary` function. Therefore, a salary of 5000 alone does not conclusively indicate that the employee is a manager.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
