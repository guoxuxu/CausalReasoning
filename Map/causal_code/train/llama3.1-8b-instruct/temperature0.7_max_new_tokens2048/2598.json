  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    if flag == 'A':\n        result = sum(data) + 10\n    elif flag == 'B':\n        result = max(data) - 5\n    else:\n        result = min(data) * 2\n    return result\",\n\nIf the function returns a result exactly twice the minimum value in 'data', does it necessarily mean the 'flag' was not set to 'A' or 'B'?",
  "Explanation": "If the result is twice the minimum value, it corresponds precisely to the operation defined for the case where the flag is neither ‘A’ nor ‘B’. Flag settings 'A' and 'B' involve either additions or subtractions with sum or max operations, which cannot exactly replicate the doubling of the minimum value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
