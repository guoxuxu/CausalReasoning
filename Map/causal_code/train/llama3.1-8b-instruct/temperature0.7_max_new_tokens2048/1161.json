  "Explanation": "Although `apply_discount` can cause `total` to decrease, observing a decrease in `total` could also result from executing the `remove_item` method, which removes an item price from the list and updates the `total` accordingly. Therefore, a decrease in `total` does not necessarily infer that `apply_discount` was executed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
