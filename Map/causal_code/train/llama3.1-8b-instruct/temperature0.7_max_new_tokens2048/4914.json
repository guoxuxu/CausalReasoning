  "Problem": "sales = [120, 150, 180, 200, 210]; discounts = [0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3]; def calculate_revenue(sales, discounts): return [sales[i] * (1 - discounts[i]) for i in range(len(sales))]\",\n\nAssuming revenue increased significantly after a specific adjustment, was this because discounts were significantly reduced?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in revenue following an adjustment suggests a constructive change impacting sales or pricing. Given the relationship, a significant reduction in discounts would be a likely cause as it would lessen the reduction factor on sales, thereby potentially increasing revenue.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "discounts → sales; sales → revenue; discounts → revenue",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The reduction in discounts led to an increase in sales, which in turn caused a significant increase in revenue."
