  "Explanation": "According to the code, the scholarship amount is causally determined by the student's age without requiring any interventions. Younger students (below 18) get a higher scholarship ($2000), and as the age increases, the scholarship amount decreases. Therefore, decreasing a student's age within the categories defined would increase their scholarship amount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
