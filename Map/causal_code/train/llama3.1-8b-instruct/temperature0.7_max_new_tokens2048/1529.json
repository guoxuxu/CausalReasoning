  "Explanation": "Changing the normalization criteria from the maximum value to the sum of the data points can alter the distribution of values in the data array. With different normalization, values that were once above the threshold might fall below, and vice versa, thereby potentially changing the number of zero entries after filtering.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
