  "Explanation": "After a code modification that ignores the 'error' key when defining the status, the presence of the 'error' key would not affect the status. The status could be 'success' regardless of the 'error' key's presence. Therefore, a status of 'success' does not allow us to infer with certainty that there was no 'error' key originally in the input.",
