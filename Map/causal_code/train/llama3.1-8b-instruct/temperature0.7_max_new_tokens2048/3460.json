  "Explanation": "Modifying the temperature by reducing it can change the output of the `risk_of_heatstroke` method. For instance, if initially the temperature was 90 or higher, reducing it below 90 would change the risk level to 'Low', directly affecting the risk of heatstroke classification.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
