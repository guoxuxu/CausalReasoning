  "Explanation": "An increase in room_temperature can be due to the heating system being activated if it was previously off and the room_temperature was below the thermostat_setting. However, if room_temperature increased, it does not imply that the thermostat_setting was originally low; it could have been that the thermostat_setting was sufficiently high to trigger the heating.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
