  "Explanation": "The final_price is calculated based on the base_price and tax rate. An increase or decrease in the base_price changes the initial calculation in calculate_final_price(). Although there's a subsequent conditional discount in apply_discount(), the initial effect of the base_price on the final_price remains.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
