  "Explanation": "Observing a discount of 0.2 indicates either that the age is over 60 or that none of the conditions were satisfied and the customer has a high loyalty score (> 5). Thus, without more information, we can't conclusively determine just from the discount that the age is over 60.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
