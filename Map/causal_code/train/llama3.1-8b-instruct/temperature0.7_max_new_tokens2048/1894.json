  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data['value'] + 2\n    y = x * 3\n    if y > 20:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    z = y - 5\n    return {'result': result, 'z': z}\",\n\nIf the output 'result' is True, can it be inferred that the input value was significantly high?",
  "Explanation": "The output 'result' being True implies that 'y' was greater than 20. Since 'y' = 3 * ('x' = input + 2), a True result implies that the input value, after being adjusted by +2 and multiplied by 3, exceeded 20, indicating a significantly high original input value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
