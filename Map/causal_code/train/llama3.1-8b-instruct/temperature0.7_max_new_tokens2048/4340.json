  "Explanation": "Increased signal strength can be due to closer proximity of the user to the base signal, removal of smaller obstacles like trees, or even a calculation error. Removal of large obstacles like buildings could be a reason but isn't the only one. This makes it unreliable to definitively infer their removal from increased signal strength alone without other context.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If a user's distance from the signal source increases, it implies that major obstacles like buildings may have been removed, as they directly cause a stronger signal strength."
