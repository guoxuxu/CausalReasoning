  "Problem": "def compute_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, season):\n    if season == 'winter':\n        discount_rate += 0.05\n    elif season == 'summer':\n        discount_rate -= 0.03\n    final_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate)\n    tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate\n    total_price = final_price + tax_amount\n    return total_price\",\n\nIf you apply an additional discount by increasing the discount_rate, will the total_price decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Applying an additional discount by increasing the discount_rate directly decreases the final_price before taxes. As a result, the total_price, which is dependent on the final_price, will also decrease.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
