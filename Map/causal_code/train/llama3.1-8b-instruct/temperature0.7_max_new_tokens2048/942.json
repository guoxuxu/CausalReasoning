  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private int temperature; private boolean isRaining; public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean rain) { temperature = temp; isRaining = rain; } public void increaseTemperature() { temperature += 5; if (temperature > 30) { isRaining = false; } } public boolean willRain() { return isRaining && temperature < 25; } }\",\n\nIf we manually made it rain through artificial means while the temperature is at 35°C, would the artificial rain stop due to the high temperature?",
  "Explanation": "Artificial intervention (making it rain) is assumed to override natural weather patterns in this scenario, and the code does not specify any behavior that would stop artificial rain due to high temperatures.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
