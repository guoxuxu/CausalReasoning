  "Explanation": "Observing 'Status quo' cannot conclusively determine the impact of medication, as other factors like exercise or basic caloric intake also affect the health status. The observed status might be a result of other interactions within the system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
