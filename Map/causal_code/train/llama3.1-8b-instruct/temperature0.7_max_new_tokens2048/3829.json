  "Explanation": "Intervening by fixing the result equal to twice the sum of data matches the condition 'C' exactly. However, it's also possible that twice the sum equals the original sum + 10 (condition 'A') or the original sum - 5 (condition 'B') under special circumstances (specific values of sum). Hence, the effect (result being twice the sum) doesn't exclusively determine the cause (condition).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
