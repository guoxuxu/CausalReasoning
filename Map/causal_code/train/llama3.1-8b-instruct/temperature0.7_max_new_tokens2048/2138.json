  "Explanation": "If the activity_status reached 'Teacher waiting', it means that the conditions set in classroom_activity were that there were no students and a teacher was present. Since the teacher presence was initially set to True and is a required condition, it indicates that the student count was zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
