  "Explanation": "Speed being 0 does not necessarily mean the engine is off. The engine could be on but the car has been decelerated to a stop, or it could be turned on but hasn't been accelerated.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
