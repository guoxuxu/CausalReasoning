  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  int temperature;\n  boolean isRaining;\n\n  WeatherSimulator(int temp) {\n    temperature = temp;\n    isRaining = false;\n  }\n\n  void updateWeather(int newTemp) {\n    temperature = newTemp;\n    if (newTemp > 30) {\n      isRaining = false;\n    } else if (newTemp < 20) {\n      isRaining = true;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWeatherSimulator simulator = new WeatherSimulator(25);\nsimulator.updateWeather(15);\",\n\nDoes updating the temperature to 15 cause it to rain?",
  "Explanation": "The method 'updateWeather' in the WeatherSimulator class sets 'isRaining' to true if the temperature is less than 20. Since the temperature is updated to 15, which is less than 20, 'isRaining' becomes true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
