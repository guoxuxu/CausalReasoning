  "Explanation": "A decrease in total sales after an intervention could be due to either a decrease in the number of new subscriptions or a decrease in the price per subscription. As these two factors multiply to compute total sales, the decrease could be attributed to either factor independently or both. Thus, a decrease in total sales does not definitively determine that the intervention was a decrease in the number of new subscriptions.",
