  "Problem": "def process_order(amount, discount_code, loyalty_status):\n    discount = 0\n    if discount_code == 'SUMMER20':\n        discount = 0.2\n    elif discount_code == 'VIPCLIENT':\n        discount = 0.25 if loyalty_status == 'Gold' else 0.15\n\n    total = amount - (amount * discount)\n    return total\",\n\nIf the returned total decreases, can we say a 'VIPCLIENT' code was used?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in the total could be due to either the use of a 'VIPCLIENT' discount or 'SUMMER20'; there can be multiple reasons for the decrease, as the discount depends also on the loyalty status if 'VIPCLIENT' is used.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
