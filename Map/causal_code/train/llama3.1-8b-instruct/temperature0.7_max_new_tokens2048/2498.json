  "Problem": "{\n    \"python_code\": \"\\\ndef compute_score(temperature, adjustment): \n\\\n    base_score = 100 \n\\\n    if temperature > 25: \n\\\n        score = base_score + (temperature - 25) * 3 \n\\\n    else: \n\\\n        score = base_score - (25 - temperature) * 2 \n\\\n    adjusted_score = score + adjustment \n\\\n    return adjusted_score\"\n  },\n\nAssuming an intervention sets the final score to 150, can we conclude that the temperature increased without knowing the adjustment?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the score to 150 through intervention does not provide conclusive evidence about the temperature, as the adjustment value can heavily influence the final score regardless of the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
