  "Explanation": "A decrease can be confirmed by `inventory_check()` showing lesser units, but this effect cannot uniquely identify a selling action as the cause without explicit evidence of a `sell_product` call; other factors like adjustments or errors could also reduce inventory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
