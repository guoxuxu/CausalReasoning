  "Explanation": "Despite the model showing that increasing the interest rate above 2.0 decreases inflation, an observation of decreased inflation alone is not sufficient to conclude the rate was raised above this threshold because there could be other external factors or interventions affecting inflation not accounted for in the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
