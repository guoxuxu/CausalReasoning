  "Explanation": "Forcing the notification to not be sent does not provide information on the individual statuses of the CPU or memory. Since the notification can be sent due to either condition being true, stopping the notification does not clarify whether the CPU is overloaded, the memory is full, or neither condition is met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
