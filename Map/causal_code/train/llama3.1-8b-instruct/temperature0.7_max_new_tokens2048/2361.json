  "Explanation": "An increase in the humidity reading could lead to a weather prediction change from 'Sunny' to 'Rain', given that temperature is over 30. Since 'Sunny' requires both conditions to be 30 or less and 70% or less, the increase in humidity may push this over the 70% threshold required for 'Rain'. Thus, if the weather changed to 'Rain', the temperature must indeed be above 30.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
