  "Explanation": "Changing the base sales number in the 'sales' dictionary directly influences the calculation of 'final_sales' due to its utilization in the formula 'final_sales = base_sales * weather_factor'. This influence is consistent regardless of the other external conditions like random promotional boosts or stock limitations.",
