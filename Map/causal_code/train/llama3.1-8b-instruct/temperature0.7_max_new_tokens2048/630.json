  "Explanation": "An increase in the number of entries in the data array is primarily affected by the filtering conditions ('date' and 'category') rather than the 'enhance' flag. The 'enhance' flag modifies the 'value' of each entry rather than affecting the count of entries, therefore increase in size cannot solely confirm the 'enhance' state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
