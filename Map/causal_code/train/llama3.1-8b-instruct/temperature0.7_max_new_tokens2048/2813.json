  "Explanation": "A 5 unit increase in 'final_sales' could be the result of either a situation where no promotion was applied (irrespective of the season), or potentially anomalous data. Thus, we cannot conclusively determine the presence of a promotion solely based on this increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
