  "Explanation": "The status being 'success' does not provide information directly about the 'processing_time'; it merely indicates absence of 'error'. The 'processing_time' only affects the 'priority' after status is determined to be 'success' but does not have any direct relation with making status 'success'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
