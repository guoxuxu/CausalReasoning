  "Problem": "def analyze_data(data):\n    height = data['height']\n    age = data['age']\n    weight = age * 2 + 10\n    if height > 170:\n        fitness = 'high'\n    else:\n        fitness = 'low'\n    return {'weight': weight, 'fitness': fitness}\",\n\nIf the fitness level is 'high', can we infer that the height is greater than 170?",
  "Explanation": "The code specifies that the fitness level is set to 'high' only if the height is greater than 170. Therefore, if fitness is 'high', it must be because the height exceeded 170.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
