  "Problem": "Provided Python Snippet Above\",\n\nIf a person is eligible for priority vaccination, can we infer that the government mandate is still effective?",
  "Explanation": "Eligibility for vaccination can be determined either due to high risk scores that meet the higher threshold (50) or because of lowered thresholds under government mandates. Therefore, eligibility does not conclusively indicate an effective government mandate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
