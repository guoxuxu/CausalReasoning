  "Explanation": "An increase in final stock of 'banana' could be directly caused by manually decreasing the sold quantity before the inventory update, since the function will subtract less from the initial stock.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
