  "Explanation": "The signal showing yellow would generally indicate that the traffic status is 'moderate'. However, an intervention directly setting the signal does not necessarily confirm that the 'traffic_status' was correspondingly set to 'moderate'; the signal could have been set to yellow by the intervention itself without changes to `traffic_status`.",
