  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data:\n        data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n        if data['is_adult']:\n            data['discount'] = '20%'\n        else:\n            data['discount'] = '10%'\n    return data\",\n\nIf the discount is '10%', can we conclude the age is less than 18?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the only condition under which a '10%' discount is set is when 'is_adult' is False, which in turn occurs only if 'age' is less than 18.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
