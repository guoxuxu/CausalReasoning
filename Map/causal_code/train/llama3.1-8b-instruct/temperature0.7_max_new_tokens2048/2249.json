  "Problem": "public class HealthSystem { private int health = 100; public void TakeDamage(int damage) { health -= damage; if (health < 0) { health = 0; } } public void Heal(int amount) { health += amount; if (health > 100) { health = 100; } } public int GetHealth() { return health; } }\",\n\nIf an external condition ensures the Heal method increases health by just 5 points each time, and we intervene to repeatedly call Heal, will GetHealth eventually return 100?",
  "Explanation": "With repeated intervention by calling the Heal method, regardless of the small increase each time, the cumulative effect will eventually reach the maximum health cap of 100, as there is a hard limit set in the Heal method that prevents health from exceeding 100.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
