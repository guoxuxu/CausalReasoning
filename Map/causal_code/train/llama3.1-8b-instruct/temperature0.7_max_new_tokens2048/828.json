  "Explanation": "The method 'add_item' adds the price of the item to the 'total'. Therefore, whenever 'add_item' is called with a positive price, the 'total' will increase reflecting the addition of a new item's price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
