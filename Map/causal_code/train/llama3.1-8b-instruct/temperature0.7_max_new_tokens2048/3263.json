  "Explanation": "The 'average_purchase' value is calculated as the sum of purchase amounts divided by the number of logins, not by the number of purchase actions. An increase in 'average_purchase' could result from either higher purchase values per transaction or fewer logins, not necessarily from more purchase actions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
