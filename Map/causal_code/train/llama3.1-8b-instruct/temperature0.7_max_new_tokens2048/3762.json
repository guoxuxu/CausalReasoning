  "Problem": "class WeatherSystem:\n    def __init__(self, temperature, humidity):\n        self.temperature = temperature\n        self.humidity = humidity\n        self.is_raining = False\n\n    def update_weather(self):\n        if self.temperature < 0:\n            self.is_raining = False\n        elif self.humidity > 80:\n            self.is_raining = True\n\nweather = WeatherSystem(25, 85)\nweather.update_weather()\",\n\nIf the humidity decreases to 75 without altering the temperature, will it still be raining?",
  "Explanation": "According to the WeatherSystem class logic in 'update_weather' method, rain only occurs if humidity is greater than 80. Therefore, lowering the humidity without changing the temperature stops rain unless it's already below freezing, which isn't the case here.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
