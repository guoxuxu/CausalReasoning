  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: Observing a non-zero 'range' only indicates that 'maximum' and 'minimum' have different values which could be from the actual data variability not necessarily from default values. This does not confirm whether there was an intervention like setting defaults for 'minimum' or 'maximum'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
