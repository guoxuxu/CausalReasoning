  "Explanation": "While the alarm becoming true indicates that the temperature surpassed 100 at some point (due to the logic in increaseTemp), it's not certain whether the temperature was above 100 just before the resetAlarm was called due to the absence of direct information on the temperature at the time of calling resetAlarm, or if other methods like emergencyShutdown or resetAlarm which reset the alarm and temperature without changing their logic, were invoked subsequently.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
