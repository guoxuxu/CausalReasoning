  "Explanation": "In the `updateWeather` method, using an umbrella during rainy conditions changes the deltaTemperature adjustment. Specifically, deltaTemperature is modified to cool down or warm up slightly depending on its original value. This is an intervention (using an umbrella) causing a direct effect on the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
