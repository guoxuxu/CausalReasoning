  "Problem": "int process(int x, int y) {\n  int a = x + y;\n  int b = a * 2;\n  int c = b - 3;\n  if (c > 10) {\n    return b;\n  } else {\n    return a;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf y is set to zero, is it always true that increasing x will increase the function's return value?",
  "Explanation": "Setting y to zero simplifies the input but the return value's behavior remains contingent on the comparison of c to 10. Given y = 0, then b would be 2x and c would be 2x - 3. Here, increasing x would increase b and c, but if c was already exceeding 10, the function returns b, which increases. If c was initially 10 or less, then a increase in x making c exceed 10 shifts the return value from a to b (where b = 2x, which is a sharper increase). Thus, while the return value may increase, it does not always do so linearly or predictably without considering the conditional switch in return value.",
