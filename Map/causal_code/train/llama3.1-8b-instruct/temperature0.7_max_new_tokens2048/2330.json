  "Problem": "def update_data(data, factor, mode='replace'): \n  if mode == 'replace':\n    return {k: v * factor for k, v in data.items()}\n  elif mode == 'incremental':\n    return {k: v + factor for k, v in data.items()}\n\ndata = {'A': 5, 'B': 10}\nupdated_data = update_data(data, 2)\ndata_effect = update_data(data, 10, 'incremental')\",\n\nIf we observe that all values in the output have increased proportionally and it is known the factors were altered, can we determine the mode was initially set to 'replace'?",
  "Explanation": "When an observed proportional increase in output values aligns with known alterations in input factors, and considering that the 'incremental' mode adds (not multiplies) the factor meaning it doesn't scale values proportionally, it is logical to conclude that the mode was 'replace'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
