  "Problem": "def compute_score(temperature, humidity):\n    discomfort_index = 0.81 * temperature + 0.01 * humidity * (0.99 * temperature - 14.3) + 46.3\n    if temperature > 25 and humidity > 60:\n        return discomfort_index * 1.2\n    else:\n        return discomfort_index\n\ntemperature = 27\nhumidity = 65\nscore = compute_score(temperature, humidity)\",\n\nDoes a high score necessarily imply high temperature?",
  "Explanation": "While a high score is influenced by high temperature as seen in the discomfort index calculation, it can also result from high humidity levels, especially with the presence of interaction between temperature and humidity in the calculation formula. High humidity along with decently high temperature can also lead to a high score without the temperature being extensively high.",
