  "Explanation": "A lower value from 'averagePricePerItem' can result either from a reduction in 'salesAmount' due to a discount or potentially an increase in 'numItems'. Without knowing the direct intervention that caused the change, one cannot definitively ascribe it to the application of a discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
