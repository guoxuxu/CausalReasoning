  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention - The implementation of an intervention that adjusts the base risk can directly cause a reduction in reported risk values compared to those calculated before the intervention, showing why the risk might be lower for an older individual on subsequent assessments.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
