  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private int temperature; private boolean isRaining; public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean rain) { temperature = temp; isRaining = rain; } public void increaseTemperature() { temperature += 5; if (temperature > 30) { isRaining = false; } } public boolean willRain() { return isRaining && temperature < 25; } }\",\n\nIf the temperature was initially below 25°C and it's raining, and the temperature increases by 5°C without any other intervention, would it still be raining?",
  "Explanation": "The increase in temperature alone (assuming it stays below 25°C assuming it started below 20°C) does not directly affect the raining condition unless it exceeds 30°C, which is not the case here as specified in the question. Hence, it will still be raining if the initial conditions are met and no other interventions are applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
