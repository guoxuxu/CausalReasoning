  "Explanation": "A higher average often results from the fact that only larger numbers, which are above a higher filter_threshold, remain in the dataset. Thus, a high average typically implies a high filter_threshold, though it's not a definitive indicator without considering the dataset's range and distribution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
