  "Explanation": "While the 'cold' illness leads to 'moderate' status in persons aged 50 or above, a 'moderate' health status alone cannot definitively confirm the illness was 'cold' without checking for other possible illnesses or conditions not covered by the code. Therefore, intervention to check age cannot conclusively determine the illness was 'cold'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
