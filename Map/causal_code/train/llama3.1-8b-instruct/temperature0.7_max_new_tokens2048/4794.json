  "Explanation": "Failure to notify law enforcement only indicates that `user.is_minor` is `False`, which implies the user is 18 or older. However, without direct observation or further information about the exact age, it's impossible to ascertain specific age details just from this intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
