  "Explanation": "Inside the 'recordSale' method, any time a sale is recorded by invoking 'recordSale', 'totalSales' is incremented by the amount of the sale. Therefore, as the number of transactions increases, the 'totalSales' naturally increases, showing a cause-effect relationship from the number of transactions (cause) to total sales (effect) without any intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
