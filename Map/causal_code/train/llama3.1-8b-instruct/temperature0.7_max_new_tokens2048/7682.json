  "Explanation": "While the shuffling affects the order of 'category_names' and indirectly the calculation of 'salary', variations in 'salary' can also stem from individual 'ages' and the corresponding 'age_increase'. Though the shuffling influences 'salary', it is not the sole cause of its variance.",
