  "Explanation": "Methods that adjust sales totals or compute averages, like 'calculateAverageSale' or 'applyDiscount', modify 'totalSales' but they do not impact 'numTransactions', which is strictly controlled by 'recordSale'. Without calling 'recordSale' specifically, the 'numTransactions' remains constant. Thus, there is no reverse causality where changing average sales can affect the number of transactions directly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
