  "Problem": "def calculate_health(age, smoker, exercise_freq):\n    base_health = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health -= (age - 50) * 2\n    if smoker:\n        base_health -= 30\n    if exercise_freq >= 3:\n        base_health += 20\n    return base_health\",\n\nIf a person stops smoking, how does this intervention affect their health score?",
  "Explanation": "Stopping smoking is an intervention that eliminates the subtraction of 30 points from the health score due to smoking. This direct intervention on the 'smoker' variable demonstrably causes an increase in the health score, illustrating a causal effect from the intervention (cause) to the change in health score (effect).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
