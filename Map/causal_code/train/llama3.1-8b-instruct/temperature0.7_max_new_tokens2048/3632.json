  "Explanation": "By modifying the outlier removal criteria to include more values (lowering the minimum from 10 to 5), more data points will be retained, especially if these additional points include values between 5 and 10 that are likely to be lower than the original mean, thus altering the calculated mean.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
