  "Explanation": "Since the temperature ends at 60 degrees Celsius and the evaporation not being triggered implies no direct setting to 100+ degrees and then reducing to 60 degrees. The temperature change strictly follows the operations defined: two increments and one decrement total, adjusting by the conditions within the increase_temperature and decrease_temperature methods. Direct setting of the temperature exclusively to 60 degrees without interim steps would avoid invoking the decrease_temperature method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
