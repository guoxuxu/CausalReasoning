  "Problem": "def product_sales(increase_advertising, current_sales):\n    increased_traffic = increase_advertising * 1.5\n    if increased_traffic > 100:\n        sales_jump = 20\n    else:\n        sales_jump = 5\n    new_sales = current_sales + sales_jump\n    return new_sales\",\n\nIf new sales reflect a smaller than expected increase despite an increase in advertising, could it be due to the basic current sales being very low?",
  "Explanation": "The final sales figure, 'new_sales', is dependent on both 'current_sales' and 'sales_jump'. If 'current_sales' are initially low, even a correct application of increased advertising and the subsequent sales jump can result in a total that's lower than expected.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
