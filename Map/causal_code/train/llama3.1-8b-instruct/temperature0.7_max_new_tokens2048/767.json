  "Explanation": "Since 'home' is the outcome only when happiness is 25 or less, intervening to set social activity to 'home' implies that under normal circumtances without intervention, happiness would not have naturally reached beyond 25.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
