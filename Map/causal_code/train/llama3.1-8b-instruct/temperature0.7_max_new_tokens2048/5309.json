  "Explanation": "Updating advertisement_spending via the update_advertising method and simultaneously recalculating sales in the same method by calling predict_sales means the output will directly depend on the new, higher advertisement spending. Here, intervention occurs by explicitly changing the advertisement_spending, which influences the predict_sales output through the increased influenced_sales calculation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing advertisement spending directly increases influenced sales, which in turn directly increases the predicted sales."
