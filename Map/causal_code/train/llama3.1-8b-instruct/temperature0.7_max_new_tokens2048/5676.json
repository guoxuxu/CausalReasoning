  "Problem": "def compute_discount(price, is_member):\n    if is_member:\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0.02\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final price is observed to decrease, could this be caused by changing the membership status from non-member to member?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the membership status from non-member to member increases the discount rate from 2% to 10%. Thus, if other conditions (like the item's price) remain constant, this change in membership status leads to an increased discount and a decreased final price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Changing the membership status from non-member to member directly causes a higher discount, which in turn directly causes a decrease in the final price."
