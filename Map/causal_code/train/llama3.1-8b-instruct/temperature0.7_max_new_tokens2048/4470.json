  "Problem": "\n    sales = 100\n    season = 'winter'\n    discount = 0.2\n    if season == 'winter':\n        sales += 50\n    else:\n        sales -= 10\n    final_price = 200 * (1 - discount)\n    if sales > 120:\n        final_price *= 0.9\n    \"\"\",\n\nKnowing that the final price does not receive a further discount at checkout, can we deduce it was not winter?",
  "Explanation": "If the final price is not reduced further (not multiplied by 0.9), then it can be deduced that sales did not exceed 120, a situation that occurs when it's not winter according to the initial code, confirming it is indeed not winter.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
