  "Explanation": "According to the code, once the accumulated steps exceed 10,000, the 'active' flag is automatically set to true. This demonstrates a straightforward causal inference from the number of steps (cause) to the active status (effect) without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
