  "Problem": "public class Vehicle { private int speed; private boolean engineRunning; public void startEngine() { if (!engineRunning) { engineRunning = true; speed = 0; } } public void stopEngine() { if (engineRunning) { engineRunning = false; speed = 0; } } public void accelerate(int increment) { if (engineRunning && increment > 0) { speed += increment; } } public int getSpeed() { return speed; } public boolean isEngineRunning() { return engineRunning; } }\",\n\nAfter calling startEngine and then accelerate with a positive increment, will calling stopEngine revert the speed to zero?",
  "Explanation": "According to the stopEngine method's implementation, it stops the engine and also sets the speed back to zero. This behavior is maintained regardless of the speed value before the engine is stopped.",
