  "Problem": "WeatherSimulation class definition with methods change_temperature and artificial_sun\",\n\nIf the temperature is manually set to 23 degrees Celsius using the change_temperature method, will people's happiness increase to 80?",
  "Explanation": "Manually setting the temperature influences the weather to sunny, hence increasing happiness to 80.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Manual temperature setting causes temperature increase, which in turn causes happiness, but there is no direct causal link from temperature to people's happiness. However, there is a direct link from happiness to people's happiness. Therefore, it's unclear if people's happiness will increase to 80."
