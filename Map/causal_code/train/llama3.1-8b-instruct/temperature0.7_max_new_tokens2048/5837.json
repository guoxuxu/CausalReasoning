  "Explanation": "Given the code, when an effective medicine (effectiveness > 8) such as the antibiotic is administered to a sick individual, it not only cures the sickness but also increases the health by 20. Therefore, if effective medicine is taken post-virus exposure, an increase in health is expected.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
