  "Explanation": "If 'adjusted_mean' is lower, one possible and direct cause could be that the multiplication factor was lower than 0.9, reducing each item in 'adjusted_data' and thus decreasing the computed 'adjusted_mean'. However, this conclusion assumes no other factors such as anomalies in the original data list.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
