  "Explanation": "Higher 'mean_age' results solely from the actual data values, unless there's explicit manipulation of 'age' data in 'clean_data'. Since the calculation of 'mean_age' doesn’t necessarily depend on cleaning logic but on the values present, no direct causal inference about cleaning modifications can be drawn.",
