  "Explanation": "A zero return from 'estimateEnergyUsage' only confirms the heater was off during the calculation, which could be for temperatures not only above 21 degrees but anywhere in the range from 21 to 25 if the heater was switched off and not intervened by setting it below 18 degrees.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
