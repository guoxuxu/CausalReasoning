  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, holiday): \n    if holiday: \n        discount_rate *= 1.5 \n    total_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate) \n    tax_amount = total_price * tax_rate \n    final_price = total_price + tax_amount \n    return final_price\",\n\nWould changing the final_price to a higher value imply that a non-holiday period has become a holiday?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the final_price cannot directly suggest the shift from a non-holiday to a holiday period, as final_price is influenced by multiple parameters like base_price, discount_rate and tax_rate. A holiday increases the discount rate, which would typically lower the final_price unless compounded by other variable changes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
