  "Explanation": "A decrease in pollution level after factory operation is impossible without interventions like decreasing the factory size or applying pollution-reduction techniques, as operating the factory inherently increases the pollution level as per the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
