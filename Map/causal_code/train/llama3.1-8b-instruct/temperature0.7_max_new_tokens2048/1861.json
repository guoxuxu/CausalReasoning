  "Problem": "def calculate_cost(products, discount, tax): \n    total = 0 \n    for price in products: \n        total += price \n    if discount > 0: \n        total *= (1 - discount) \n    total *= (1 + tax) \n    return total\",\n\nIf the 'products' list increases in size, will the 'total' also increase?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'total' is a summation of the 'products' prices, increasing the number of products or the price of existing products will directly increase the 'total'. Here, there's a direct causal relationship where changes in the product prices or size of the list (cause) increase the total (effect) without any additional intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
