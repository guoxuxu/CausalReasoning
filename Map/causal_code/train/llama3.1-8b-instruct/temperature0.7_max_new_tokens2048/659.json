  "Explanation": "Setting 'cold_days_count' to zero manually as an intervention does not affect the original 'data' temperatures directly. The actual temperatures could still be below 10, but have been ignored or not counted due to the intervention. This highlights the limitation in inferring the natural cause from an artificial effect caused by intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
