  "Problem": "def calculate_health(age, smoking_status, exercise_freq):\n    base_health = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health -= (age - 50) * 0.5\n    if smoking_status:\n        base_health -= 20\n    if exercise_freq >= 3:\n        base_health += 15\n    return base_health\",\n\nIf we implement a regimen where a person under 50 begins exercising frequently, will their health score increase?",
  "Explanation": "Exercising frequently (3 or more times a week) increases the person's health score by 15 points as indicated in the function, which is an intervention causing an effect on health.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
