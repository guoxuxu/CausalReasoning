  "Explanation": "The code explicitly sets `max_speed` to 150 if `engine_type` is not 'electric'. Diesel, being a non-electric engine type, falls under this condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
