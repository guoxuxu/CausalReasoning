  "Problem": "def calculate_score(temperature, humidity, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        base_score = 20\n    elif season == 'winter':\n        base_score = 30\n    else:\n        base_score = 25\n\n    if temperature > 75:\n        temperature_score = 5\n    else:\n        temperature_score = 3\n    \n    if humidity > 50:\n        humidity_score = 10\n    else:\n        humidity_score = 8\n\n    final_score = base_score + temperature_score + humidity_score\n    return final_score\",\n\nIf you can control the humidity and set it to 70, will this action increase the humidity_score and thus the final_score?",
  "Explanation": "The function increases the humidity_score to 10 if the humidity is above 50. Therefore, setting the humidity to 70 increases the humidity_score, which in turn increases the final_score.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
