  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    normalized_data = normalize(data) \n    processed_data = apply_filter(normalized_data, threshold=0.5) \n    return processed_data \n\ndef normalize(data): \n    max_val = max(data) \n    return [x / max_val for x in data] \n\ndef apply_filter(data, threshold): \n    return [x if x > threshold else 0 for x in data]\",\n\nIf the 'threshold' value is increased, will the number of zero entries in 'processed_data' typically increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the threshold in the 'apply_filter' function filters out a larger portion of the data as zeros because more data points will be below the higher threshold. This means the result from 'apply_filter' will have more zeros, leading to an increase in zero entries in 'processed_data'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
