  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(prices, discounts, region):\n    if region == 'East':\n        tax_rate = 0.07\n    else:\n        tax_rate = 0.1\n    final_prices = [(price - discount) * (1 + tax_rate) for price, discount in zip(prices, discounts)]\n    return final_prices\",\n\nIf final prices increase, does this mean the tax rates have been increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in final prices can be caused by several factors including higher initial prices or lower discounts, not necessarily an increase in the tax rate. The tax rates as defined in the code are fixed per region regardless of the changes in other variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
