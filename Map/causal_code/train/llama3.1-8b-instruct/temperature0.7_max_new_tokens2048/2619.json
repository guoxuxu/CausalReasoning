  "Problem": "class ProductSales { constructor(price, discount) { this.price = price; this.discount = discount; this.finalPrice = this.calculateFinalPrice(); } calculateFinalPrice() { return this.price - (this.price * this.discount); } updatePrice(newPrice) { this.price = newPrice; this.finalPrice = this.calculateFinalPrice(); } updateDiscount(newDiscount) { this.discount = newDiscount; this.finalPrice = this.calculateFinalPrice(); } } const product = new ProductSales(100, 0.2); product.updatePrice(120); product.updateDiscount(0.25);\",\n\nDoes a lower final price imply a higher initial price?",
  "Explanation": "A lower final price does not necessarily imply a higher initial price. It could be influenced by a higher discount rate which reduces the final price irrespective of an increase or decrease in the initial price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
