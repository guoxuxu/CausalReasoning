  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  adjusted_data = data ** 2\n  result = adjusted_data * 5\n  return result\n\nvalue = 10\nprocessed_value = process_data(value)\nprint(processed_value)\",\n\nWill the value of 'processed_value' change if 'value' is incremented by 1 without modifying the 'process_data' function?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'value' causes an increase in 'processed_value' because the output of the function 'process_data' depends directly on the input 'value'. The relationship follows a quadratic adjustment and linear scaling, so any increment in 'value' causes a more than proportional change in 'processed_value'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
