  "Problem": "int main() {\n  int traffic = 0;\n  int lights = 1; // 0 is red, 1 is green, 2 is yellow\n  bool accident = false;\n  if (lights == 0) {\n    traffic = 1; // 0 is smooth, 1 is heavy\n  } else if (lights == 1) {\n    traffic = 0;\n  } else if (lights == 2) {\n    traffic = 1;\n  }\n  if (traffic == 1) {\n    accident = true;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\",\n\nIf you manually enforce that the traffic light is always yellow (lights = 2), will this lead to more accidents?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the traffic lights to yellow (2) changes the traffic to heavy (1) according to the code. When traffic is heavy, the condition to set 'accident' to true is fulfilled. Thus, this intervention causes more accidents by increasing traffic congestion.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
