  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.9\n        else:\n            return price\n    elif season == 'winter':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.8\n        else:\n            return price * 1.1\n    else:\n        return price\",\n\nIf there is no discount provided, will the sales price always remain the same as the listed price?",
  "Explanation": "The sales price will not remain the same as the listed price in the 'winter' season where the price increases by 10% irrespective of the discount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
