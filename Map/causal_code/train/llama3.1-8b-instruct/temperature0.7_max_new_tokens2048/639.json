  "Problem": "def compute_results(data):\n    a = 5\n    b = a + 3\n    def modify_b(x):\n        return x * 2\n    c = modify_b(b)\n    if c > 20:\n        result = 'High'\n    else:\n        result = 'Low'\n    return result\",\n\nIf you intervene and set 'b' directly to 12, will this guarantee that the 'result' is 'High'?",
  "Explanation": "By setting 'b' to 12, calling 'modify_b(b)' will result in 'c' being 24 (since 12 * 2 = 24). Given the condition in the code, if 'c' is greater than 20, 'result' will be 'High'. Here, an intervention directly affects 'result' through 'c'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
