  "Explanation": "The output of calculateDiscountedRevenue can decrease due to either a reduction in average sales or an increase in the discountRate. While applyExtraDiscount does increase the discountRate, decreases in average sales might happen independently due, for example, to lower individual weekly sales amounts. Therefore, a decrease in revenue doesn't necessarily mean that applyExtraDiscount was executed.",
