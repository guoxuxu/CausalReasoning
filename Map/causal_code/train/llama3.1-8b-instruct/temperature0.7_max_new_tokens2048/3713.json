  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    data['profit'] = data['revenue'] - data['costs']\n    data['profit_margin'] = (data['profit'] / data['revenue']) * 100\n    if data['city'] == 'New York':\n        data['adjusted_profit'] = data['profit'] - 100\n    else:\n        data['adjusted_profit'] = data['profit']\n    return data\",\n\nAssuming an intervention has maximized 'profit_margin', can it be concluded that 'costs' were minimized?",
  "Explanation": "Maximizing 'profit_margin' requires maximizing the ratio of 'profit' over 'revenue'. One effective way to achieve this under the given code is by minimizing 'costs', which directly increases 'profit', thus maximizing 'profit_margin'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
