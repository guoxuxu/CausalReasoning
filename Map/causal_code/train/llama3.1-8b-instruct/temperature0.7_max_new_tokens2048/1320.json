  "Problem": "class CommercialBuilding { int rent; int bill; bool popular_area; int num_tenant(int guests) { this.rent += 50; if(guests > 100 || popular_area) { bill += guests * 2; return guests; } else { return guests / 2; } } void adjust_rent_and_bill(bool economic_crisis) { if(economic_crisis) { rent -= 100; bill += 50; } else { rent += 100; bill -= 20; } }}\",\n\nIf rent decreases significantly, was it likely due to an economic crisis?",
  "Explanation": "Rent is reduced by 100 as a direct consequence of an economic crisis according to the method 'adjust_rent_and_bill'. This implies that a notable decrease in rent might likely be attributed to economic circumstances as defined in the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
