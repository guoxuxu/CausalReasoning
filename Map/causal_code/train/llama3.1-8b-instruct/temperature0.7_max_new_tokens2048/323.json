  "Problem": "class Calculator { constructor(initValue) { this.value = initValue; } add(x) { this.value += x; } subtract(x) { this.value -= x; } getValue() { return this.value; } } const calc = new Calculator(10); calc.add(5); calc.subtract(3); const output = calc.getValue();\",\n\nWould introducing a new operation 'calc.multiply(2);' after the 'add' and before the 'subtract' operations affect the final output of the program?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a 'multiply' operation after 'add(5)' would change the intermediate state from 15 to 30 (15 * 2), and following 'subtract(3)', the final output would then be 27 instead of 12. Therefore, intervening by adding a multiplication operation significantly affects the outcome due to the compound effect on the subsequent subtraction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
