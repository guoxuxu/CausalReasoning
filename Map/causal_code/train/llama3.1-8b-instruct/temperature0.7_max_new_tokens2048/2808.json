  "Problem": "class Calculator { int a; int b; Calculator(int x, int y) { a = x; b = y; } int multiply() { return a * b; } void updateValues(int x, int y) { a = x; b = y; } int add() { return a + b; } }\",\n\nIf we use the updateValues function to set a = 10 and b = 5, will the output of the multiply method be greater than before the update?",
  "Explanation": "With an intervention through the updateValues function explicitly setting a and b, the output of the multiply method will be 50, which will be greater than before unless both a and b were already greater than or equal to 10 and 5 respectively. This showcases a causal relationship from cause to effect with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "updateValues(a, b) → a; updateValues(a, b) → b; updateValues(a, b) → multiply(); multiply() → output of multiply method; multiply() → output of multiply method; output of multiply method → greater than before the update"
