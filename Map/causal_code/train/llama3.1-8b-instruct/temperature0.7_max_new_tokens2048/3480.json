  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n\\t processed_data = [x * 2 for x in data if x > 10] \n\\t return processed_data\n\ndata = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] \nresult = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf we replace the condition 'x > 10' in the code with 'x > 8', will it increase the number of elements in 'processed_data' for the given 'data' list?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the conditional check from 'x > 10' to 'x > 8' lowers the threshold required for elements to be included and processed. Previously, numbers greater than 10 (i.e., 15, 20, 25) were included, and with the new condition, the number 10 will now also be included, increasing the count of elements processed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
