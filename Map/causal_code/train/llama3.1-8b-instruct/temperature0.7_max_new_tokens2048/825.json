  "Explanation": "The weather_condition is influenced by both temperature and humidity, but observing it does not provide precise values or a unique determination of these properties due to overlapping conditions (e.g., 'Moderate' could be indicative of several temperature and humidity combinations).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
