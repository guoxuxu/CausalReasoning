  "Explanation": "Seeing an increase in the infection rate to 15% from 5% (given an infection rate was reduced to 5% due to high vaccination rate) implies that the variant was strong (strength > 0.5), as only a strong variant would increase the infection rate by 50% according to the `introduce_variant` method.",
