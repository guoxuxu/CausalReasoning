  "Explanation": "An increase in temperature could either be due to the heater being used via the artificialChange method or naturally through the updateWeather method if it was increasing without raining. Therefore, a mere increase in temperature doesn't confirm the use of the heater.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
