  "Explanation": "The air conditioning being active does not imply manual intervention, as it could also be the result of the automatic control system responding to past external temperature changes. Without additional data about past temperatures or the state changes, one cannot conclude manual intervention solely on the air conditioning status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
