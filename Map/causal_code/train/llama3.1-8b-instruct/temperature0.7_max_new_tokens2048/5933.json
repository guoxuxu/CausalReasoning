  "Explanation": "Adding a constant to all elements of data_list increases the mean approximately by the same constant, thus the adjusted_data remains roughly unaffected while the bound condition on max_min_ratio might still hold true. The modifications in the balanced_data addition (either +5 or +1 still stand), hence, generally, the output values increase.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
