  "Problem": "public class WeatherControl { private boolean rain; private int temperature; public WeatherControl(boolean raining, int degrees) { this.rain = raining; this.temperature = degrees; } public void changeWeather(boolean rain, int tempChange) { this.rain = rain; this.temperature += tempChange; } public boolean willTreesFlourish() { return this.rain && this.temperature > 50; } }\",\n\nIf we use the `changeWeather` function to set raining true and increase the temperature, will this ensure the trees flourish?",
  "Explanation": "Using `changeWeather` to make it rain and increase the temperature above 50 directly creates the necessary conditions for the trees to flourish.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
