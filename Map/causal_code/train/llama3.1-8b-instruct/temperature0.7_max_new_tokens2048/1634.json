  "Problem": "def adjust_temperature(current_temperature, desired_temperature):\n    if current_temperature < desired_temperature:\n        return 'increase', desired_temperature - current_temperature\n    elif current_temperature > desired_temperature:\n        return 'decrease', current_temperature - desired_temperature\n    else:\n        return 'maintain', 0\n\ndef control_system(temperature_reading, set_point):\n    action, adjustment = adjust_temperature(temperature_reading, set_point)\n    if action == 'increase':\n        heating_system(adjustment)\n    elif action == 'decrease':\n        cooling_system(adjustment)\n    else:\n        maintain_temperature()\n\ndef heating_system(degrees):\n    print(f'Heating by {degrees} degrees.')\n\ndef cooling_system(degrees):\n    print(f'Cooling by {degrees} degrees.')\n\ndef maintain_temperature():\n    print('Temperature is optimal.')\",\n\nIf the system reports it is cooling, can we conclude the original set point was lower than the current temperature?",
  "Explanation": "If 'cooling_system' is activated, it implies 'adjust_temperature' returned 'decrease' for the action, indicating the original set point was below the current temperature leading to the activation of the cooling system.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
