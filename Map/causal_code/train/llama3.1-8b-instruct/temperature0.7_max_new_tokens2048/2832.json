  "Explanation": "According to the code, the health index increases by 2 for each hour of exercise ('base_health += (exercise_hours * 2)'). Imposing a rule of 1 hour of exercise (intervention) thus directly causes the health index to increase by 2, demonstrating the causal impact of exercise (cause) on health index (effect) with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
