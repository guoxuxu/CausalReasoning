  "Problem": "int processOrder(int quantity, bool isMember) { if (isMember) { return quantity * 2; } else { return quantity; } }\",\n\nIf an order's value is observed not to have doubled, can we infer that the user has definitely not been upgraded to membership?",
  "Explanation": "If the order value is observed not to have doubled, under the assumption that input parameters (i.e., quantity) remain consistent post-intervention, it can be inferred that the user has not been upgraded to membership. The code defines that member's orders are doubled, hence unchanged values suggest no membership upgrade.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
