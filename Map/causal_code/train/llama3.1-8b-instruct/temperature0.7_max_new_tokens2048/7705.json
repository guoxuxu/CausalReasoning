  "Explanation": "The increase in age from 55 to 65 crosses the threshold from 60, which based on the conditions specified in update_risk_level, increases the risk level by 2 points if the person is also a smoker, and increase in risk level simply due to passing the age of 50 if they are non-smoker.",
