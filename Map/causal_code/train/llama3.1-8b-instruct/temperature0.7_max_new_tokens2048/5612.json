  "Explanation": "A growth factor less than 300 could also be due to low temperatures or sunlight levels, not necessarily just the water level influence. The randomized water levels in the simulation may still contribute more than 120, but combined with other low factors could result in growth less than 300.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
