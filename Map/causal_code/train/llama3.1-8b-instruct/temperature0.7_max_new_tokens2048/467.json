  "Explanation": "Adjusting the filter_threshold to ensure at least 15 data points are included after filtering can potentially lower the threshold, incorporating more data points which might be below the previous average, this might lead to considering otherwise excluded lower data, which can affect the 'is_reliable' status based on the given condition of having more than 10 data points.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
