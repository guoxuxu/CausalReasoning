  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\n    x = input_data['temperature']\n    y = input_data['humidity']\n    if x > 30:\n        z = x * 0.9\n    else:\n        z = x * 1.1\n    w = y / 2\n    result = z + w\n    return result\",\n\nIf the temperature increases, will the result necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in temperature will lead to z being calculated as 0.9 times the temperature if it exceeds 30, which is a decrease in the multiplication factor from 1.1 to 0.9. This change could mean the z might not increase depending on the initial value of temperature relative to 30, thus the result might not necessarily increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
