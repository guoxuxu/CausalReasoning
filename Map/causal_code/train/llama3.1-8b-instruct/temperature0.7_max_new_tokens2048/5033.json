  "Explanation": "Manually turning on the heater results in an increase in the current temperature by 1 degree each time the 'update_temperature' is run, as long as the heater remains on regardless of the external temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
