  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(num_sales, num_returns, advertising_budget):\n    revenue = num_sales * 100 - num_returns * 25\n    advertising_effectiveness = (num_sales / advertising_budget) if advertising_budget > 0 else 0\n    return revenue, advertising_effectiveness\",\n\nIf we increase the advertising budget while keeping returns constant, will the advertising effectiveness increase?",
  "Explanation": "Advertising effectiveness in the function is calculated as 'num_sales / advertising_budget'. Increasing only the 'advertising_budget' without an increase in 'num_sales' will result in a decrease in advertising effectiveness because the denominator in the effectiveness calculation increases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing advertising budget causes an increase in revenue and an increase in advertising effectiveness, as it leads to an increase in the number of sales."
