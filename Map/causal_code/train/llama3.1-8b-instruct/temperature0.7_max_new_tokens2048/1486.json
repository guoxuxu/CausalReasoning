  "Problem": "int sales = 200; \nint advertising_expense = 50; \nif (advertising_expense > 40) {\n    sales += advertising_expense * 2;\n} else {\n    sales -= 10;\n}\nint customer_feedback = (sales / 10); \nif (customer_feedback > 30) {\n    advertising_expense += 20;\n}\",\n\nIf the company intervenes by lowering customer feedback, does this imply that sales will have to decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Given that customer feedback is directly calculated from sales (customer_feedback = sales / 10), a company intervention to lower customer feedback would directly necessitate a reduction in sales, as per the mathematical relationship defined in the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
