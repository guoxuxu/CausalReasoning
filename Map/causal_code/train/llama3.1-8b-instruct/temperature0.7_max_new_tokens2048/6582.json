  "Explanation": "Increasing scores will raise the average, which is directly linked to setting the status to 'above average' if it surpasses 50.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
