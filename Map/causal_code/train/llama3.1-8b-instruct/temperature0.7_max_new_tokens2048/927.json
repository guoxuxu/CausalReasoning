  "Explanation": "The variable 'result' is computed from 'filtered_data' and is not part of any condition affecting how 'filtered_data' is generated. 'result' is an outcome of the process and has no reverse effect on whether the filter is applied or not ('use_filter').",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
