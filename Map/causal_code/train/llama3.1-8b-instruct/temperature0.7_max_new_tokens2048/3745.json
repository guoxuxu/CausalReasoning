  "Explanation": "Intervening by increasing sleep hours and water intake can potentially lead to the evaluateHealth method returning true, assuming these were the causative factors for the previous poor health evaluation. Direct diet intervention isn't immediately necessary to see an effect, although it might still be critically low or high.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
