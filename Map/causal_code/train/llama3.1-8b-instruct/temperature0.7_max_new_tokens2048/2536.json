  "Explanation": "While rain is predicted in scenarios where the temperature is above 20 and humidity exceeds 65, the presence of rain does not confirm the temperature must be above 20. Rain could occur under other unconsidered conditions or assumptions not reflected in this code snippet, thereby not ruling out other temperatures categorically.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
