  "Explanation": "When `remove_item(200)` is executed before applying a 0.1 discount, the total is recalculated first with one item removed. Therefore, when the discount is subsequently applied, the resultant `total` will be based on the smaller sum and hence will not be the same as if the discount were applied first with all items still included.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
