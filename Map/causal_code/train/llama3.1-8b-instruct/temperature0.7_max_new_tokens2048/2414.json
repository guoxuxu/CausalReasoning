  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    warmed_data = 0.5 * data * (1.2 + data)\n    if data > 20:\n        return warmed_data \n    else:\n        return warmed_data - 10\n\ndata_input = 15\nresult = process_data(data_input)\",\n\nAfter removing the conditional branch in the 'process_data' function, if 'result' decreases, can we ascertain that 'data_input' was decreased?",
  "Explanation": "Once the conditional subtraction is removed, every change in 'result' correlates directly to a change in 'data_input' because the only operation left relates 'warmed_data' directly with 'data_input' through a linear equation, dependent on 'data_input'. As a result, the function becomes a simple linear transformation of 'data_input', so a decrease in 'result' directly indicates a decrease in 'data_input'. Therefore, by this intervention, we can ascertain changes in 'data_input' based on observing changes in 'result'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
