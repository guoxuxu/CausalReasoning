  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting the income to 60000 (above the 50000 threshold), we directly cause the 'tax_bracket' condition to switch to 'high'. This is a controlled intervention, displaying causality directly from the manipulated 'income' to the resulting 'tax_bracket'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
