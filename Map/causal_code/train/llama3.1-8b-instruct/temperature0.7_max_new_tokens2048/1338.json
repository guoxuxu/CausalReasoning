  "Explanation": "`isWet()` will return true if it is both rainy and cold. The `increaseTemperature(5)` could potentially make the temperature greater than 15 degrees, but since `isWet()` returned true, this means that both the cold and rainy conditions are satisfied. Given that the temperature factor could have been influenced (though in this instance it was not enough), the only unaltered condition remaining to be true due to initial state must be that it was rainy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
