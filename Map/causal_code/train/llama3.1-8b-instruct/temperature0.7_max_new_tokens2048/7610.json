  "Problem": "class SalesData {\n  int basePrice = 100;\n  int discountRate = 20;\n  boolean hasDiscount = false;\n\n  public void applyDiscount() {\n    if (hasDiscount) {\n      basePrice -= discountRate;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public int finalPrice(int additionalFee) {\n    applyDiscount();\n    return basePrice + additionalFee;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf observing a decrease in 'basePrice', can we conclude 'hasDiscount' was true?",
  "Explanation": "The decrease in 'basePrice' can suggest 'hasDiscount' might be true, but without observing the state of 'hasDiscount' directly we cannot conclude it definitively because there could be other parts of code not shown that might alter 'basePrice'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
