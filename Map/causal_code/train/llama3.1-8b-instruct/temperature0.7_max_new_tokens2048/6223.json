  "Problem": "def compute_salary(base_salary, days_worked, bonus, tax_rate):\n    salary_without_tax = base_salary * days_worked / 30\n    if bonus:\n        salary_without_tax += 500\n    tax = salary_without_tax * tax_rate\n    net_salary = salary_without_tax - tax\n    return net_salary\",\n\nIf base_salary is increased, will net_salary definitely increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, `net_salary` is computed based on `salary_without_tax`, which is directly proportional to `base_salary` (i.e., `salary_without_tax` = `base_salary` * `days_worked` / 30). Even though the `tax` also increases as `salary_without_tax` increases, the overall `net_salary` will still show a net increase as a result of an increase in `base_salary` because the `tax_rate` is a percentage and does not affect the positive linear relationship between `base_salary` and `net_salary`.",
