  "Explanation": "Although an increase in the 'flag_value' (from non-positive to positive) results in a significant output increase (by switching from subtracting 5 to adding 10), a significant increase in the output alone cannot confirm this without knowing changes in the 'data_list'. If 'data_list' values increase significantly, this could also explain the increase in output, revealing knowledge of 'from effect to cause with intervention.' The answer stresses that just observing an effect (output increase) doesn’t validate the specific cause (increase in flag_value) without further data.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
