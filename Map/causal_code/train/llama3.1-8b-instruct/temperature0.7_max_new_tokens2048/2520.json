  "Problem": "See above Python code example\",\n\nIf the weather is cloudy, does it imply pollution is above 80?",
  "Explanation": "Given the logic of the update_weather method, a 'cloudy' weather condition only arises when pollution levels are above 80.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
