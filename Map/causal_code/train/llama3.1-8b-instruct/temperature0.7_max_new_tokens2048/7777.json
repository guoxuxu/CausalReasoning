  "Problem": "The above Python code block\",\n\nIf the weather is rainy, will the traffic delay generally be longer?",
  "Explanation": "The code has a conditional statement where if the weather is rainy, the traffic delay options are 10, 20, or 30 minutes, which are all higher than the delay options for other weather conditions (0, 5, or 10 minutes). This directly implies a longer delay on rainy days.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Rainy weather → Wet roads; Wet roads → Slippery roads; Slippery roads → Reduced visibility; Reduced visibility → Increased accident rate; Increased accident rate → Traffic congestion; Traffic congestion → Longer traffic delay",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Rainy weather causes longer traffic delay through a chain of events: slippery roads, reduced visibility, increased accident rate, and traffic congestion."
