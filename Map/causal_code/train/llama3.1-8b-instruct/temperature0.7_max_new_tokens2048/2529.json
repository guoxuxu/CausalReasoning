  "Problem": "Python code provided above.\",\n\nIf the government imposes restrictions reducing 'PM2.5' emissions, will this affect the output of 'issue_alert' method?",
  "Explanation": "Reducing 'PM2.5' emissions directly decreases its concentration, which in turn lowers the pollution index potentially altering the alert level issued by the method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
