  "Explanation": "The 'forecast' outputting 'cool' simply implies that the last recorded temperature is 20 degrees Celsius or lower. This could be the result of either setting a low initial temperature or using 'decrease_temperature', but is not exclusively indicative of the latter.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
