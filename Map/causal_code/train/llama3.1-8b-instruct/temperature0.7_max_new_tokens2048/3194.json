  "Explanation": "Updating the hour to 20 reduces the temperature by 5 units as it's greater than 12. This reduction in temperature, based on the given condition, sets the temperature below 20 if the initial temperature was 25, which leads to rain. Thus, updating the hour to 20 from an early hour directly causes the weather to become rainy by affecting the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
