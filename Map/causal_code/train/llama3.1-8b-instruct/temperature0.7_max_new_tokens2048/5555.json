  "Problem": "def manipulate_data(data, action):\n    if action == 'increase':\n        result = data * 1.2\n    elif action == 'decrease':\n        result = data / 1.5\n    else:\n        result = data - 10\n    return result\n\ndata_value = 50\noutput = manipulate_data(data_value, 'increase')\",\n\nIf the action parameter is set to 'increase', will the output always be higher than the input?",
  "Explanation": "The function 'manipulate_data' multiplies the input data by 1.2 when the action is 'increase'. Multiplying a positive number by 1.2 will always result in a number that's larger than the original, thus the output will always be higher than the input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The action parameter determines the multiplier applied to the data, and the output is directly proportional to the product of the data and the multiplier."
