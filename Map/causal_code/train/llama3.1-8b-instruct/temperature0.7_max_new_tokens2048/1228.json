  "Explanation": "The function `update_temperature` adjusts the current temperature to be closer to the ambient temperature (an effect of the ambient temperature). With a decrease in the ambient temperature, the formula `current_temp + 0.1 * (ambient_temp - current_temp)` results in a lower current temperature over time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
