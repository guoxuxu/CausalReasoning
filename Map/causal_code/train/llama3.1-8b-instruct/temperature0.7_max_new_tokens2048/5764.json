  "Explanation": "The sales computation in the code does not feed back into the inventory or price settings. Sales results from the price, but changes in sales do not affect inventory directly; thus, no backward influence exists from sales to inventory without intervention in this system.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
