  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'final_score' might reflect reductions in either 'test_score', 'age', or both, since both components are weighted sums that contribute to the final outcome. Without additional context or specific value changes, both are potential causative factors of a reduced 'final_score'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
