  "Explanation": "While a lower patient_response generally suggests a higher dose, doses in the lower range (<=50) also decrease health, albeit to a lesser extent. Other unobserved factors like pre-existing health conditions could also affect the response.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
