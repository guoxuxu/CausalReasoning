  "Explanation": "Increasing the initial inventory in the constructor of the OnlineStore class would allow larger orders to be fulfilled. Having a higher starting inventory means that unless the order quantity exceeds this new higher inventory, the purchase will be fulfilled.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
