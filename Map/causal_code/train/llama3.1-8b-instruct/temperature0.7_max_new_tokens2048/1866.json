  "Explanation": "A lower 'average_age' might suggest problems in how 'age' data is being processed or cleaned in 'clean_data' such as incorrect filling of missing values or data type errors. The function directly manipulates 'age' data which directly affects the 'average_age' calculated in 'analyze_data'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
