  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'base_price' leads directly to an increment in the final price before applying discounts or taxes, and hence even after applying the same discount and tax rate, the absolute amount added due to sales tax will be higher.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
