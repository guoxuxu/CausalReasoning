  "Explanation": "Manually increasing humidity does not affect temperature directly. If the humidity increases without changing other factors, only the conditions internal to the startRain method (like decrease of temperature on high humidity) may trigger; this does not suggest a heat wave as simulateHeatWave raises both temperature and reduces humidity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
