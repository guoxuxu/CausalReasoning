  "Explanation": "Boosting productivity through policies does not affect the physical temperature of the office. This question reverses cause and effect and also involves an intervention that does not logically connect the desired cause with the expected effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
