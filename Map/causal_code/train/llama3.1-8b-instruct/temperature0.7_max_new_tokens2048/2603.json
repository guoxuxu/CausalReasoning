  "Problem": "int process(int x, int y) {\n  int a = x + y;\n  int b = a * 2;\n  int c = b - 3;\n  if (c > 10) {\n    return b;\n  } else {\n    return a;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the function returns a value less than or equal to 10, does that indicate that x and y summed to 10 or less?",
  "Explanation": "A smaller return value is based on returning a, which happens when c (b - 3) ≤ 10. However, since b is calculated as (x + y) * 2, x and y could sum to values less than or equal to 6.5 approximately, (since (6.5 * 2) - 3 = 10) which is a larger range than just '10 or less'. Therefore, the return value being less than or equal to 10 does not conclusively indicate that the sum of x and y was 10 or less.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
