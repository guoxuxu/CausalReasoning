  "Problem": "As above\",\n\nIf the plant's growth rate increased significantly, can we conclude that both sunlight and water were sufficient?",
  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention: a significant increase suggests that both sunlight and water conditions were met. However, it's important to note that this question assumes all other variables are constant or sufficient.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
