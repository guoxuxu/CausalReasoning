  "Problem": "def business_logic(revenue, costs, marketing_campaign_active):\n    profit = revenue - costs\n    if marketing_campaign_active:\n        revenue_increase = revenue * 0.2\n        revenue += revenue_increase\n    return profit\n\n# Assume initial conditions\ninitial_revenue = 10000\ninitial_costs = 7000\ncampaign_active = True\n\nresulting_profit = business_logic(initial_revenue, initial_costs, campaign_active)\",\n\nIf we were to intervene by increasing initial revenue by 50%, would this guarantee a resulting profit increase as computed by the function?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the initial revenue, even with the marketing campaign active, directly results in an increased profit as the profit is the difference between revenue and costs. Since costs remain constant in this scenario and the function increases revenue by 50% aside from any effect from the marketing campaign, the profit definitely increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
