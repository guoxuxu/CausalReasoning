  "Problem": "class AirConditioner { boolean isElectricityOn; int temperature; AirConditioner() { isElectricityOn = true; temperature = 24; } void increaseTemp(int increment) { if(isElectricityOn) { temperature += increment; } } void decreaseTemp(int decrement) { if(isElectricityOn) { temperature -= decrement; } } void powerSwitch() { isElectricityOn = !isElectricityOn; } }\",\n\nAfter observing an increase in 'temperature', if 'powerSwitch' is toggled and 'increaseTemp' fails to further increase 'temperature', can we infer the Air Conditioner was initially on?",
  "Explanation": "If toggling 'powerSwitch' makes 'increaseTemp' ineffective, it means 'isElectricityOn' was changed from true to false, implying the Air Conditioner was initially on since it allowed previous increase in temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
