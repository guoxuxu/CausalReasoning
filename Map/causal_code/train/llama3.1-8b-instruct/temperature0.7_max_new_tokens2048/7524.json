  "Problem": "As presented above within the ECommerceSystem class\",\n\nIf customer retention is observed to decrease, and we intervene by increasing discounts, can we determine that the initial decrease was due to low sales?",
  "Explanation": "Customer retention could decrease due to low customer satisfaction, independent of sales. Increasing discounts impacts sales and could potentially improve customer satisfaction, but it does not clarify whether the initial decrease in retention was specifically due to low sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Customer Retention → Decrease in Sales; Increase in Discounts → Decrease in Customer Retention; Sales → Customer Satisfaction; Customer Satisfaction → Customer Retention; Sales → Revenue; Revenue → Customer Retention; Increase in Discounts → Decrease in Revenue; Decrease in Revenue → Decrease in Sales; Customer Satisfaction → Sales",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Decrease in customer retention is likely due to low sales, as increasing discounts may indicate low revenue, which in turn causes a decrease in sales, which then leads to a decrease in customer retention."
