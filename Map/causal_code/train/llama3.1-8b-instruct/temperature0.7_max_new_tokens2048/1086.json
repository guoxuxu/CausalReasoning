  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting the temperature to 85 degrees in winter, the activity will shift to 'swimming' since it surpasses the temperature threshold of 75 degrees needed for swimming despite the winter season.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
