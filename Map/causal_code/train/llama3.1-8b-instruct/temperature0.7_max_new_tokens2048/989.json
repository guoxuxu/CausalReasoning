  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'temperature' in data:\n        heating_on = data['temperature'] < 18\n    else:\n        heating_on = False\n\n    if 'humidity' in data and heating_on:\n        condensation_risk = data['humidity'] > 80\n    else:\n        condensation_risk = False\n\n    return {'heating_on': heating_on, 'condensation_risk': condensation_risk}\",\n\nIf it is observed that the heating is on, can we assume that the temperature was below 18 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "Although the heating is turned on when the temperature is below 18, the absence of a temperature reading ('temperature' not in data) leading to the default 'heating_on' value being False is not considered when the heating is on. Thus, we cannot definitively conclude that the temperature was below 18 just because the heating is on; there might be other reasons (such as manual override or changes not captured in the code).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
