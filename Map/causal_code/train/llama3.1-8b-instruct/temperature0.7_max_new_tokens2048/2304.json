  "Problem": "def weather_impact(weather, season):\n    if weather == 'rainy' and season == 'winter':\n        return 'snowy'\n    elif weather == 'sunny' and season == 'summer':\n        return 'hot'\n    elif weather == 'cloudy' or (weather == 'rainy' and season == 'summer'):\n        return 'cool'\n    else:\n        return 'mild'\",\n\nIf the function returns 'hot', can we conclude that the weather was 'sunny' and the season was 'summer'?",
  "Explanation": "Given the conditions in the function, the only scenario where 'hot' is returned is if weather is 'sunny' and the season is 'summer'. There are no other conditions leading to the function returning 'hot'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
