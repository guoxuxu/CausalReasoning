  "Explanation": "An unchanged stock value could result from either no discount being applied or exact offsetting changes, such as a discount being exactly counteracted by an increase in quantity or reversal of the discount. Without further evidence on what interventions were made, one cannot conclusively determine the causation from this observation.",
