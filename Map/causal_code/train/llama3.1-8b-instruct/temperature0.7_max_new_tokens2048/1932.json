  "Explanation": "shouldBringUmbrella() returns false if either it is not raining or the temperature is 25 or above. If we set the temperature to 30 after observing a false return value, it does not isolate the cause to lack of rain as the method could initially return false due to a high temperature. Thus, intervention on temperature alone after observing the effect does not identify the initial state of rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
