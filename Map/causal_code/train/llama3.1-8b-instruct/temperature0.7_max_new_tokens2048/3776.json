  "Explanation": "The code shows a fixed increment in crop yield by 20 units when fertilizer is added (cropYield += 20 when fertilizerAdded). Hence, for any given similar conditions of sunlight and rain, adding fertilizer will always increase the yield.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
