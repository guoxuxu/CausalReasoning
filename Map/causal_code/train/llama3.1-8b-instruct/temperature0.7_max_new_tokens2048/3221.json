  "Explanation": "If an intervention led to a decrease in rain probability, based on the code, it suggests the most attributed factors—humidity thresholds in the willItRain() method—were not met, possibly due to decreased humidity, given that this directly affects rain probability according to the method logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
