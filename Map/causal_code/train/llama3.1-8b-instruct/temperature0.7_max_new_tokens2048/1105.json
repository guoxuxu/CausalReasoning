  "Explanation": "A 'Good' health_status can result from either diet_quality > 5 or exercise_freq >= 2 without both needing to be true. Therefore, exercise_freq could still be 3, meeting its condition independently.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
