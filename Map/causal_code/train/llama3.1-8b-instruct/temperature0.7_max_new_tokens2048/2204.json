  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    data['adjusted'] = data['original'] * 1.2 \n    if data['environment'] == 'urban': \n        data['final'] = data['adjusted'] + 20 \n    else: \n        data['final'] = data['adjusted'] - 10 \n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'final' value is observed to increase, can we conclude that the 'original' value has definitely increased, assuming no other intervention and environment remains urban?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in 'final' in an urban environment could be due to changes in the 'original' value, but it could also result from switching the 'environment' from non-urban to urban, which causes an increase due to the environment condition effect alone (additional 20 points).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
