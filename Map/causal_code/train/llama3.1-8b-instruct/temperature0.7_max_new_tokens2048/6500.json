  "Explanation": "A decrease in the calorie count could be caused either by an increase in steps, as handled by the `walk` function, or through other interactions not specified (like maybe adjustments directly to the calories count in the code or other unimplemented methods affecting the calories). Therefore, we cannot confirm that a decrease in calories is solely caused by an increase in steps without any other potential interventions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
