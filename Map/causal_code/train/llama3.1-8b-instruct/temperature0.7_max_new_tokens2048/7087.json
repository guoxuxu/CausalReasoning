  "Explanation": "While antipyretics reduce fever, the 'is_flu' method also considers cough intensity. If the cough intensity remains above 5, simply reducing fever will not affect the flu status determination which requires both no fever and a lower cough intensity. In the given code, there's no change in cough intensity, so fever reduction alone isn't sufficient to assert the patient doesn't have flu without knowing initial cough intensity.",
