  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { void simulateWeather(String season, boolean rainy) { int humidityLevel; if (season.equals('summer')) { humidityLevel = 70; if (rainy) humidityLevel += 20; } else if (season.equals('winter')) { humidityLevel = 30; if (rainy) humidityLevel += 10; } displayHumidity(humidityLevel); } void displayHumidity(int level) { if (level > 80) System.out.println('High humidity'); else System.out.println('Normal humidity'); } }\",\n\nIf the season is summer and it is rainy, will the humidity display indicate 'High humidity'?",
  "Explanation": "In the given code, during summer, the base humidity level is set at 70. When it is rainy, an additional 20 is added to the humidity, resulting in a total of 90. Since 90 is greater than 80, the display will indicate 'High humidity'.",
