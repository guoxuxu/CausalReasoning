  "Explanation": "An average of '0' in 'result' does not imply that all entries in 'raw_data' are the same, especially considering how the data is processed. However, it reflects the characteristic of 'processed_data' after normalization and scaling, which might hypothetically suggest uniformity or zeroes post initial transformations; nevertheless, 'analyzed_data' would never practically have a zero average unless error or specific conditions are introduced, as all-original entries of '0' would still cause scaled entries to be zero across.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
