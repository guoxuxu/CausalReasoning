  "Problem": "{\n        \"Description\": \"A software module for a content management system where posts by users are automatically categorized based on keywords and tagged by sentiment before being published. The sentiment tagging can occasionally fail due to API timeouts.\",\n        \"Code\": \"def categorize_post(post):\n    keywords = extract_keywords(post.content)\n    category = determine_category(keywords)\n    return category\n\ndef tag_sentiment(post):\n    try:\n        sentiment = sentiment_analysis_api(post.content)\n    except TimeoutError:\n        sentiment = 'Unknown'\n    post.sentiment = sentiment\n    return sentiment\n\ndef publish_post(post):\n    category = categorize_post(post)\n    sentiment = tag_sentiment(post)\n    database.save(post.category, post.sentiment, post.content)\n    return 'Post Published'\"\n    },\n\nCan an increase in posts tagged with 'Unknown' sentiment indicate issues in the sentiment analysis API?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'Unknown' tags are primarily applied when there is a TimeoutError during sentiment analysis, an increase in such tags could suggest problems (like decreased responsiveness or failures) with the sentiment analysis API.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
