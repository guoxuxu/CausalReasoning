  "Explanation": "Without changing the cooling system status, an increase in ambient temperature directly increases the temperature calculated by the function because the ambient temperature is a base component in both conditions of the cooling system (on or off).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
