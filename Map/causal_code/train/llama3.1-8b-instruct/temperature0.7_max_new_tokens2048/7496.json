  "Explanation": "Even if the status is manipulated to be 'normal' through an intervention, it does not reflect the actual temperature measured. The modification deceives the status check but doesn't affect the actual temperature. Hence, we cannot reliably determine the temperature based on the 'normal' status alone after such an intervention.",
