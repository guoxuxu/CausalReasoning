  "Explanation": "Changing the temperature from 25 to 35 moves it above the threshold of 30, which typically would change the condition to 'Sunny'; however, since the humidity is above 70, the condition changes to 'Rainy' instead of 'Sunny'. So the condition remains 'Rainy'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
