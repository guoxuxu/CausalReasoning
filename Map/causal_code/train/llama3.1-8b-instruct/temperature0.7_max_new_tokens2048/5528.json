  "Explanation": "Although one pathway for the user to receive a 10% discount is by being an adult without active subscription, several other scenarios might have taken place outside the provided code context, such as a direct call to `offer_discount()` method, which are not age-dependent. Therefore, observing a discount of 10% does not definitively cause one to conclude that the user's age is 18 or more.",
