  "Explanation": "A high final price can result from a combination of factors including a smaller discount, higher tax rate, or the initial higher price. The causal relationship from final price to initial price isn't direct; intervening variables like discounts and region-specific tax rates also influence the final price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
