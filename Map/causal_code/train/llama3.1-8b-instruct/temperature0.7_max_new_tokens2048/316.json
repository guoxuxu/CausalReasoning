  "Problem": "def compute_scores(data):\n    average = sum(data)/len(data)\n    adjustments = [x * 0.1 for x in data]\n    corrected_scores = [x + adjust for x, adjust in zip(data, adjustments)]\n    return corrected_scores, average\n\nscores = [65, 70, 75, 80]\nadjusted_scores, mean_score = compute_scores(scores)\",\n\nAssuming the 'corrected_scores' values were observed to increase, can we infer that the 'adjustments' were increased?",
  "Explanation": "While higher 'corrected_scores' could result from increased 'adjustments', they might also increase if the original 'scores' were higher. Without information solely isolating the change in 'adjustments', we cannot conclusively infer that increased 'adjustments' were the cause of the higher 'corrected_scores'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
