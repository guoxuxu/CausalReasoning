  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, restock, current_inventory): \n    sold_units = sales['units_sold'] \n    restocked_units = restock['units_added'] \n    new_inventory = current_inventory - sold_units + restocked_units \n    return new_inventory\",\n\nDoes increasing the 'units_sold' in the 'sales' dictionary decrease the 'new_inventory' assuming no change in 'current_inventory' and 'units_added'?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'new_inventory' is calculated by subtracting 'sold_units' from 'current_inventory' and adding 'restocked_units'. Increasing 'units_sold' directly decreases 'new_inventory', because you subtract a larger number from the 'current_inventory'. This demonstrates how changing the cause (units sold) affects the effect (new inventory) without any intervention on other variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
