  "Explanation": "The code specifies that for printing jobs with priority 5 or higher, the operation should 'halt' if there’s an error and 'proceed' if not. Changing the error status from True to False thus changes the state from 'halt' to 'proceed'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
