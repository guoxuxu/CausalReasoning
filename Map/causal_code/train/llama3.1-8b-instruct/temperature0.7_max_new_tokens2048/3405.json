  "Problem": "class UserAccount { constructor(balance) { this.balance = balance; } deposit(amount) { this.balance += amount; } withdraw(amount) { if (amount <= this.balance) { this.balance -= amount; return true; } else { return false; } } getBalance() { return this.balance; } } const user = new UserAccount(1000); user.deposit(500); const successfulWithdrawal = user.withdraw(1200); const remainingBalance = user.getBalance();\",\n\nGiven a lower balance than expected, can we conclude a specific amount was withdrawn if we know a withdrawal had occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Even though a withdrawal decreases the balance, without knowing the exact amount withdrawn, we cannot conclude the specific amount withdrawn solely based on the balance being lower. Different withdrawal amounts can result in the same final balance due to various prior transactions affecting the initial balance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
