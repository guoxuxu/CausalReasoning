  "Explanation": "Since lower sales result from higher prices in the `predict_sales` function, and `adjust_price` increases prices when the market trend is 'down', a decrease in `final_sales` implies that the market trend likely caused an increase in prices.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
