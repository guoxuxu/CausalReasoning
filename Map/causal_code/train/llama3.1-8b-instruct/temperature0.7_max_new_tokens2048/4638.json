  "Explanation": "With an intervention that sets the adjusted_temperature to a higher value, ensuring that the sensor_value is above 100 is necessary because the formula adds an additional 5 only in the range above 100. This is the only case in the function logic that adds a constant value (5), which can result in a significantly higher adjusted_temperature when combined with the multiplication of 1.05.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The sensor_value directly influences the temperature, and the adjustment_factor, which is directly influenced by sensor_value, also influences the temperature."
