  "Explanation": "The output being 'Above Average' from a subset of the list does not provide information about the individual elements excluded from the calculation. The remaining items not being considered might be lower or higher, and their values are not inferred solely by the average of part of the list.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
