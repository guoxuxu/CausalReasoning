  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_val, modify_flag):\n    filtered_data = [x for x in data if x > filter_val]\n    if modify_flag:\n        transformed_data = [x * 2 for x in filtered_data]\n    else:\n        transformed_data = filtered_data\n    return sum(transformed_data)\",\n\nIf 'modify_flag' is set to True, will the 'process_data' function return a higher sum compared to having 'modify_flag' set to False?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'modify_flag' to True doubles each element of 'filtered_data' before summing, typically resulting in a higher overall sum compared to when 'modify_flag' is not active and values aren't doubled.",
