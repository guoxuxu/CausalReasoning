  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'price' in data:\n        data['discount'] = data['price'] * 0.1\n    data['sales'] = data.get('discount', 0) * 10\n    if 'weather' in data and data['weather'] == 'sunny':\n        data['sales'] *= 1.2\n    return data\",\n\nIf after an intervention, 'sales' were observed to increase, can we conclude that the 'weather' was 'sunny'?",
  "Explanation": "The increase in 'sales' could still be influenced by other interventions such as changes in 'discount' or 'price'. Unless it is explicitly known that there was no intervention on these variables, an increase in 'sales' alone cannot conclusively indicate sunny weather.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
