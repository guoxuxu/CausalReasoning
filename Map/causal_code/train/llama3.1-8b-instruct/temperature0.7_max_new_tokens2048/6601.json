  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(num_sales, num_returns, advertising_budget):\n    revenue = num_sales * 100 - num_returns * 25\n    advertising_effectiveness = (num_sales / advertising_budget) if advertising_budget > 0 else 0\n    return revenue, advertising_effectiveness\",\n\nIf advertising effectiveness increases, can we deduce whether it was caused by an increase in sales or a decrease in advertising budget?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in 'advertising_effectiveness' could mean either 'num_sales' increased, or 'advertising_budget' decreased, or both. The formula does not allow us to specifically attribute the cause without information about changes in both 'num_sales' and 'advertising_budget'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in advertising budget can increase sales, which in turn can increase advertising effectiveness, but this relationship is mediated by sales."
