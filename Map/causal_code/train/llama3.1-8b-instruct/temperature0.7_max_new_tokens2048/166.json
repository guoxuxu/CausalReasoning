  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    modified = data * 2\n    if modified > 20:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    return result\",\n\nDoes a return value of True always mean the input data was greater than 10?",
  "Explanation": "A return value of True signifies that the modified data (data * 2) exceeded 20, which directly indicates that the input data was indeed greater than 10.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
