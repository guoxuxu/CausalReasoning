  "Explanation": "A decrease in temperature does not guarantee it will start raining. The rain starts only when the temperature is explicitly set to decrease as a result of rain or drops below 15 degrees only due to a direct action such as changeTemperature() method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
