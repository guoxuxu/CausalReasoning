  "Problem": "def update_temperature(weather_data, action):\n    temperature = weather_data['temperature']\n    if action == 'increase':\n        temperature += 3\n    elif action == 'decrease':\n        temperature -= 5\n    return temperature\n\n# Example usage\ncurrent_weather = {'temperature': 20}\nnew_temperature = update_temperature(current_weather, 'increase')\",\n\nIf the action is changed to 'decrease', will the temperature always decrease?",
  "Explanation": "The code defines that if the action input is 'decrease', it subtracts 5 from the temperature. Therefore, irrespective of the initial temperature value, the output temperature after this action will always be 5 degrees lower than the input temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
