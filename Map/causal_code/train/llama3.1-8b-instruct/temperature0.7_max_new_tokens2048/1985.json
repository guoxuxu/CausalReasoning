  "Explanation": "In the code, the 'car_arrives' method increments the 'car_count' if the light_status is 'green'. Once the light is green and a car arrives, the car count naturally increases, according to the defined method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
