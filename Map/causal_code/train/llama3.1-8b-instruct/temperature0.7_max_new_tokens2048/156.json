  "Explanation": "The function returning a calculated interest simply implies that the balance was non-negative at the time of the function call. It does not necessarily mean the balance was explicitly adjusted or set to positive just before; the balance could inherently have been non-negative.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
