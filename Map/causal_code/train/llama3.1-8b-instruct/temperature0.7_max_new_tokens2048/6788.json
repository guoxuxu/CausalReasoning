  "Explanation": "Applying a 20% discount to `sales_data` via `apply_discount` method modifies each element of the data array, leading to decreased values. When `total_sales` sums this modified data, the result will be lower than if no discount were applied. This is a causal effect resulting from the intervention of applying a discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
