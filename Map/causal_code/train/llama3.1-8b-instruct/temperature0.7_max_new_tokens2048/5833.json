  "Problem": "class Simulation { constructor(populationSize) { this.populationSize = populationSize; this.populationInfected = 0; this.vaccineDistributed = false; } applyVaccine() { if (!this.vaccineDistributed) { this.populationInfected = this.populationSize * 0.1; this.vaccineDistributed = true; } } increaseInfectionRate(rate) { this.populationInfected += this.populationSize * rate; if (this.vaccineDistributed) { this.populationInfected -= this.populationSize * 0.05; } } }\",\n\nWould the application of the 'applyVaccine' method result in a lower infection rate?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the 'applyVaccine' method sets the initial level of 'populationInfected' to 10% of 'populationSize' and prohibits further uninhibited increases. Any infection rate increase post-vaccination will have less impact due to the vaccine's protective decrement effect.",
