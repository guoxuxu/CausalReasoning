  "Explanation": "Although setting the temperature below 25°C will decrease humidity if it falls below 10°C (humidity decreases by 10), a rain probability of 80% implies high initial humidity (above 80) that will not necessarily drop below 60, the next threshold for rain probability (50), with such an intervention.",
