  "Explanation": "The status 'young' is assigned if the 'age' condition ('age' <= 20) is met or if 'age' is missing from the data. Therefore, a status of 'young' does not uniquely determine that the age must be 20 or less—it may also indicate missing age data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
