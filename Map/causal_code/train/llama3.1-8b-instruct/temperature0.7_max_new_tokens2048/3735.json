  "Explanation": "While it's true that sales generally increase with quantity, the presence of discounts (both fixed and percentage) applied on larger quantities when a promotion is active or crossing the threshold can alter the final sales amount making it not purely indicative of higher quantities sold.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
