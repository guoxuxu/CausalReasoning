  "Explanation": "Travel time is determined by traffic conditions which in turn depends on the weather, but reducing travel time through interventions like traffic management does not influence the weather conditions as per the causal sequence in the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
