  "Explanation": "If rain is observed, it can be inferred that the new temperature might have been set below 10 or kept the same as per the initial conditions due to the logic implemented in the adjustWeather method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
