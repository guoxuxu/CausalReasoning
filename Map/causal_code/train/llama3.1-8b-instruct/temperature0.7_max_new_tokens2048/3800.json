  "Explanation": "Adding a heat wave to 25 degrees increases temperature to 30 degrees; setting humidity to 95 triggers the temperature to decrease by 2 degrees due to the humidity adjustment rule. Hence, the temperature falls to 28 degrees, resulting in mild weather according to the report conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
