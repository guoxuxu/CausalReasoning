  "Explanation": "Introducing a new exercise habit sets the hasExerciseRoutine to true, which triggers the updateHealthScore method where 20 points are added to the health score for maintaining an exercise routine.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
