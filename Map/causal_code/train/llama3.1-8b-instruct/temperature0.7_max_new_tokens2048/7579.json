  "Problem": "def compute_values(temp, pressure):\n    boiling_point = 100 + (pressure - 1) * 0.5\n    if temp > boiling_point:\n        state = 'Gas'\n    elif temp == boiling_point:\n        state = 'Transition'\n    else:\n        state = 'Liquid'\n    return state\",\n\nIf we adjust the pressure to 1 atmosphere and the temperature remains the same, will this ensure the state is 'Liquid'?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the pressure to 1 atmospheres sets the boiling point to 100 degrees Celsius. Whether the state is 'Liquid' still depends on whether the original temperature was less than 100. If the temperature was 100 or higher, adjusting the pressure alone would not make the state 'Liquid'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
