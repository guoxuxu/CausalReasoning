  "Problem": "def calculate_cost(products, discount, tax): \n    total = 0 \n    for price in products: \n        total += price \n    if discount > 0: \n        total *= (1 - discount) \n    total *= (1 + tax) \n    return total\",\n\nIf a law is introduced setting the minimum 'discount' rate, will the 'total' reduce when all other variables are held constant?",
  "Explanation": "Setting a minimum discount rate (intervention on 'discount') while keeping 'products' and 'tax' constant will directly reduce the 'total' cost calculation as the total amount is multiplied by (1 - discount), and with a higher discount rate, this multiplication factor becomes smaller, thus reducing the total.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
