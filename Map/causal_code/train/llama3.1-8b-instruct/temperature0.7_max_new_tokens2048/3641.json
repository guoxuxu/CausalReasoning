  "Explanation": "The 'strategy' variable is independent of the computed 'sales'; it is predefined before sales calculation and is not altered based on sales output. Altering 'sales' values does not feed back into altering the 'strategy'. Hence, the strategy remains as initially set regardless of changes in sales.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
