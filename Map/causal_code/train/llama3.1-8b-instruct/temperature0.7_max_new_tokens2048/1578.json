  "Explanation": "The method `isHealthy` returning true only indicates that the current heart rate is less than 100 and water intake is at least 2000 ml. It doesn't give information on whether these values were achieved naturally or through interventions such as adjusting the heart rate or manually increasing water intake.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
