  "Explanation": "The question of whether a heat wave was applied cannot be conclusively determined if the forecast is not cold. `isCold` returning false indicates that `forecastTemp` is 20 or above. Whether this state was achieved naturally from an initial state of 15 degrees or more (without an intervention), or if it was from applying the heat wave to an initial state which consequently raises the `forecastTemp` from below 20 to 20 or more, cannot be definitively traced solely from `isCold` returning false.",
