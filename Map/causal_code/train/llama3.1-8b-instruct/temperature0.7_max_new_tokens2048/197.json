  "Explanation": "The provided weight falls within the normal range (50-100 kg), so the health risk depends on age. If the person's age is 50 or less, regardless of diet, the health risk is low. Thus, the health risk being high cannot be concluded without knowing the age.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
