  "Explanation": "High 'voter_turnout' could be influenced by any combination of high 'voter_population', increased 'campaign_funds’, or 'good' weather conditions. Without specific data isolating weather conditions while holding other variables constant, we cannot conclusively determine the cause of increased turnout.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
