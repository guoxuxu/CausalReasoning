  "Problem": "def compute_score(temperature, humidity):\n    discomfort_index = (0.81 * temperature) + 0.01 * humidity * (0.99 * temperature - 14.3) + 46.3\n    if discomfort_index > 80:\n        return 'High'\n    elif discomfort_index > 60:\n        return 'Moderate'\n    else:\n        return 'Low'\n\nresult = compute_score(30, 70)\",\n\nWill altering the temperature variable potentially change the discomfort index calculated within the function?",
  "Explanation": "The discomfort index formula includes temperature as a significant component, and changes in temperature will directly affect the value of the discomfort index.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
