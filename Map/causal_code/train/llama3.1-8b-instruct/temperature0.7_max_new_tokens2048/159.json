  "Explanation": "The `adjust_for_season` method modifies the `temperature` and `humidity` attributes based on the specified season. For the 'winter' season, it decreases the temperature and increases the humidity. These changes are likely to make conditions more favorable for a rainy weather status in `is_rainy()`. This shows a cause to effect relationship with an intervention, catalyzed through a control method adjusting environmental conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
