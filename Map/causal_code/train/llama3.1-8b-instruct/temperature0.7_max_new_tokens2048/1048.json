  "Explanation": "In the 'total_sales' method, the total is calculated from records where the status is 'completed'. Changing a sale's status to 'completed' adds its amount to the total sales calculation, thereby increasing the total sales value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
