  "Explanation": "Being 'Not eligible' can result both when a new policy is not applied (age <= 65 and no chronic disease, or age > 65 but with neither chronic disease nor new policy inclusion) and when a new policy is applied but other conditions do not fulfill (e.g., a young person with no chronic issues even under new policy).",
