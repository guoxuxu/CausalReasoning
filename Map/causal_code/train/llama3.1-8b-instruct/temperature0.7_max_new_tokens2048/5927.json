  "Problem": "def compute_health_score(age, fitness_level, is_smoker):\n    score = 100\n    score -= age\n    if age > 50:\n        score -= 10\n    if fitness_level > 7:\n        score += 20\n    else:\n        score -= 20\n    if is_smoker:\n        score -= 30\n    return score\",\n\nIf the person is younger, will the health score necessarily be higher?",
  "Explanation": "Although the initial scoring system subtracts the person's age from 100, other factors like being a non-smoker and high fitness level can significantly affect the score. So, a younger person who smokes or has a low fitness level might not necessarily have a higher score than an older person who is a non-smoker and has a high fitness level.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
