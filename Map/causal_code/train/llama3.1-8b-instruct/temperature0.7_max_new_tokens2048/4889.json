  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data):\n  discounts = data['discount'] > 20\n  weekend = data['day'].isin(['Saturday', 'Sunday'])\n  high_sales = data['sales'] > 500\n  if discounts and weekend:\n    increase = 0.15 * data['sales']\n  else:\n    increase = 0.05 * data['sales']\n  data['forecast_sales'] = data['sales'] + increase\n  return data\",\n\nIf we programmatically set all days to be weekends, will this lead to an increase in all forecast_sales calculations?",
  "Explanation": "Changing all days to weekends manipulates the 'weekend' variable to always be true, which, when combined with any present discounts over 20%, will result in utilizing the higher 15% increase formula, thus raising the forecast_sales across the board.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If discounts are applied, then the increase in forecast sales is higher."
