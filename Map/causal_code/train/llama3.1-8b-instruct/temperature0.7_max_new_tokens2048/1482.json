  "Problem": "class ShoppingCart { constructor() { this.items = []; this.total = 0; } addItem(item, price) { this.items.push({item: item, price: price}); this.updateTotal(); } removeItem(itemName) { this.items = this.items.filter(item => item.item !== itemName); this.updateTotal(); } updateTotal() { this.total = this.items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0); } applyDiscount(code) { if (code === 'SAVE10') { this.total *= 0.9; } else if (code === 'SAVE20') { this.total *= 0.8; } } }\",\n\nDoes a reduction in total price to 80% of its value necessarily mean a 'SAVE20' discount was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Although applying 'SAVE20' results in reducing the total price to 80% of its original, total can theoretically be brought to similar figures by a precise combination of adding and removing items, or applying different discounts, making the cause not uniquely determined by observing the effect alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
