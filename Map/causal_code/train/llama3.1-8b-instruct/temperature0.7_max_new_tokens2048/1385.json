  "Explanation": "Applying a 15% discount to all orders changes the cost calculation condition in the function. For orders previously benefiting from a 10% discount due to crossing the 50-item threshold, the new higher discount (from 10% to 15%) applied universally will decrease the total cost more than before for those orders.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
