  "Explanation": "The alarm state depends on both temperature and blood pressure. Lowering the temperature alone does not automatically turn the alarm off if the blood pressure remains high. There's no method implemented to automatically reassess and turn off the alarm when temperature decreases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
