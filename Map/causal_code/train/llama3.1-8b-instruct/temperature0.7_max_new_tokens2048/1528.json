  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    normalized_data = normalize(data) \n    processed_data = apply_filter(normalized_data, threshold=0.5) \n    return processed_data \n\ndef normalize(data): \n    max_val = max(data) \n    return [x / max_val for x in data] \n\ndef apply_filter(data, threshold): \n    return [x if x > threshold else 0 for x in data]\",\n\nIf there are no zero entries in 'processed_data', can we conclude that the 'normalize' function didn't divide any data points?",
  "Explanation": "The absence of zero entries in 'processed_data' simply means that all normalized data points were greater than the threshold set in 'apply_filter'. It does not indicate that the 'normalize' function did not perform division, as its role is to divide each data point by the maximum value, not to determine whether they exceed the threshold.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
