  "Problem": "class ShoppingCart {\n  constructor() {\n    this.items = [];\n    this.discount = 0;\n  }\n\n  addItem(item) {\n    this.items.push(item);\n    this.updateDiscount();\n  }\n\n  updateDiscount() {\n    if (this.items.length > 5) {\n      this.discount = 20;\n    } else {\n      this.discount = 0;\n    }\n  }\n\n  removeItem() {\n    if (this.items.length > 0) {\n      this.items.pop();\n      this.updateDiscount();\n    }\n  }\n\n  calculateTotal() {\n    let total = this.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);\n    return total - total * this.discount / 100;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the discount is observed to be 20%, does it imply that the cart has more than 5 items?",
  "Explanation": "Given the code structure, the only condition under which the discount is set to 20% is when the items count surpasses 5 according to the updateDiscount() method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
