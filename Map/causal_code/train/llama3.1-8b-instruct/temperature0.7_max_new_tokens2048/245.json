  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, stock, replenish):\n    for item, sold in sales.items():\n        if item in stock:\n            stock[item] -= sold\n            if stock[item] < 5:\n                if item in replenish:\n                    stock[item] += replenish[item]\n    return stock\",\n\nIf sales increase, will the function always decrease the corresponding stock?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, an increase in sales naturally decreases stock as the code reduces stock quantities by the number of sales. This is direct cause to effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
