  "Explanation": "Setting humidity to a higher level of 70 impacts the discomfort index due to the positive term `0.01 * humidity * (0.99 * temperature - 14.3)` and crossing the conditional `if temperature > 25 and humidity > 60` means any result will be multiplied by 1.2. Since the original humidity at 65 also satisfies this condition, increase in humidity will increase the discomfort index itself, leading to a higher score even before considering the conditional multiplier.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
