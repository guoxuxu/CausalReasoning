  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand_increment, advertising, season):\n    base_demand = 50\n    if season == 'high':\n        seasonal_factor = 1.5\n    else:\n        seasonal_factor = 1.0\n    demand = base_demand + demand_increment * seasonal_factor\n    if advertising > 20:\n        demand *= 1.2\n    sales = demand * price\n    return sales\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in 'sales,' can we intervene by modifying 'season' to 'high' to establish that the season was the cause?",
  "Explanation": "While setting 'season' to 'high' increases the 'seasonal_factor', which boosts 'demand', it cannot solely confirm that the previous increase in 'sales' was due to the season. The initial increase in 'sales' might also have been caused by a variety of other factors like changes in 'price', 'advertising', or 'demand_increment'. Establishing causality directly from an increase in 'sales' to 'season' alone requires isolating other influencing factors.",
