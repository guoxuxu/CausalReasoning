  "Explanation": "A change to rainy condition can be caused either by a decrease in temperature, an increase in humidity, or both. Without additional information, we cannot definitively conclude that an increase in humidity occurred.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
