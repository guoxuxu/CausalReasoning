  "Explanation": "Introducing a control that resets the base_price to its original value post-discount neutralizes the effect of the apply_discount() method on the base_price. Consequently, this intervention would prevent any change in the final_price() attributable to the discount, showcasing analysis from cause to effect with intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
