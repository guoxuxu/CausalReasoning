  "Problem": "class AirConditioner { constructor(powerState, temperature) { this.isOn = powerState; this.temperature = temperature; }  setTemperature(newTemp) { if (this.isOn && newTemp >= 16 && newTemp <= 30) { this.temperature = newTemp; } } togglePower() { this.isOn = !this.isOn; if (!this.isOn) { this.temperature = null; } } }\",\n\nIf the air conditioner's power is turned on and a setTemperature(25) method is called, will the temperature be set to 25?",
  "Explanation": "Turning the air conditioner on sets `this.isOn` to true. Subsequent call to setTemperature with a valid temperature within the allowed range (16-30 degrees) successfully updates the temperature to 25 due to the temperature setting conditions being met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
