  "Explanation": "Salary can increase due to factors other than an increase in age, like changes in the noise term added to `education_years` or the noise directly added to `salary`. Thus, an increase in average salary doesn't necessarily mean that the average age has increased.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
