  "Explanation": "While applying a coupon (changing 'has_coupon' from False to True) leads to a lower final price, the same effect could also be achieved by changing the 'customer_type', specifically increasing the discount in the 'calculate_discount' function. Thus, a drop in final price cannot solely be attributed to the change in 'has_coupon'.",
