  "Explanation": "Manipulating the work performance to be 'excellent' does not definitely mean the weather was sunny because achieving an 'excellent' performance could also be effected by setting the right conditions like mood being 'good' (possibly through other means than sunny weather like interventions or other unmodeled factors) and consuming more than one cup of coffee. There are pathways to achieving 'excellent' performance that do not depend on the weather being sunny.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
