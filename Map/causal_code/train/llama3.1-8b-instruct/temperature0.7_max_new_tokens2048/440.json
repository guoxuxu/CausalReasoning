  "Explanation": "A lower number of sales can contribute to a higher final stock; however, this isn't necessarily the sole cause. The final stock could also be high due to high purchases or a very high initial stock. Without isolating the other variables, the impact of the intervention on sales alone doesn't definitively explain the final stock.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
