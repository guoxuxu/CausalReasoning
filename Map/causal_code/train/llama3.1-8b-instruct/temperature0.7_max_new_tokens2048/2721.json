  "Explanation": "If is_energetic is set to true by an intervention or method outside the existing code logic (without altering daily_calories_burned), we cannot assume exercise time based on this. The usual association between exercise and energy (set by the exercise method) does not hold under this artificial intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
