  "Explanation": "Observing a 10% discount (final price 90% of original) for all could indeed occur under the intervention where everyone is treated as an adult; however, it could also happen if all the data entries naturally had 'age' values over 18. Without additional information, we can't conclusively say there was an intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
