  "Explanation": "While increasing marketing effort increases the likelihood of product success, a decision to expand also requires the product to be successful, which is probabilistic. Therefore, merely increasing marketing effort doesn't guarantee expansion.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
