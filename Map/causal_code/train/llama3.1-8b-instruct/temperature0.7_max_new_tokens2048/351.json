  "Problem": "def process_sales(data, discount_threshold, discount_rate, tax_rate):\n    total_sales = sum(data)\n    if total_sales > discount_threshold:\n        discount = total_sales * discount_rate\n        total_after_discount = total_sales - discount\n    else:\n        total_after_discount = total_sales\n    tax = total_after_discount * tax_rate\n    final_total = total_after_discount + tax\n    return final_total\",\n\nIf we apply a higher `discount_rate`, will this necessarily result in a higher `final_total`?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the `discount_rate` will lead to a larger discount amount once applied but only if `total_sales` surpasses `discount_threshold`. This could lower the `total_after_discount`, which could decrease or neutralize expected increases in `final_total` due to the smaller base for tax calculation, despite the higher `discount_rate`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
