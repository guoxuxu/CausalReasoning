  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\n    noisy_data = input_data + 10\n    filtered_data = noisy_data - 5\n    processed_data = filtered_data * 2\n    return processed_data\",\n\nIf the variable input_data is increased, will the variable processed_data also increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing input_data directly raises noisy_data due to addition operation. This increase in turn raises filtered_data and ultimately processed_data. Since no external changes to operations or coefficients applied, the relationship is directly proportional.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
