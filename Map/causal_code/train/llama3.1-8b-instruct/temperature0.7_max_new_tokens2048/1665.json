  "Explanation": "After invoking invest_more(), additional_amount is added to the investment. Then, the adjust_investment() is called with the current market trend, which can either increase, decrease, or maintain the investment size depending on whether the market is 'bull', 'bear', or 'neutral'. Hence, even after the intervention, the market trend affects the total investment size.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
