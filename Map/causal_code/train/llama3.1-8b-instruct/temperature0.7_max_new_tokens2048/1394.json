  "Explanation": "An increase in net_profit could be due to a variety of factors including better sales, reduced losses, or even other fiscal measures like cost-cutting elsewhere or changes in tax obligations. Without specific data isolating the effects of the advertising campaign, it cannot be determined that the intervention causally improved sales or reduced losses directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
