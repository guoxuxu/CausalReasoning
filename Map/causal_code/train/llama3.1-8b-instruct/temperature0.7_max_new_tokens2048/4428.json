  "Problem": "def environment_simulation(temp, policy, energy_demand):\n    if temp > 30:\n        air_quality = 'Poor' if policy == 'Weak' else 'Moderate'\n    else:\n        air_quality = 'Good'\n    power_production = energy_demand * 1.1 if temp < 20 else energy_demand * 0.9\n    return air_quality, power_production\",\n\nIf poor air quality is observed, can we assume temperature is always above 30 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "Poor air quality can indeed result from high temperatures (above 30 degrees) combined with a 'Weak' policy, as per the code. However, it's not possible to definitively conclude that the temperature must be above 30 whenever air quality is poor, since the policy impacts air quality levels directly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
