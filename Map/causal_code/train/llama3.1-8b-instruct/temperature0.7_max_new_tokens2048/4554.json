  "Explanation": "If a 'purchase' operation fails, it typically implies insufficient stock or the item not being present. By applying the 'restock' intervention, it either adds or increases the stock of items, altering the inventory state so that a reattempt of the purchase might succeed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
