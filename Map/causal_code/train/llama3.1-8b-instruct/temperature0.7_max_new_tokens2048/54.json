  "Explanation": "A negative forecast ('people not going outside') can be caused either by non-sunny weather or by a sunny day with a temperature of 25 or below. Hence, it is not sufficient to conclude the absence of sun solely based on people not going outside.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
