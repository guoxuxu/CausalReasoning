  "Explanation": "Forcing the weather status to 'Sunny' alters only the representation of the weather condition but does not affect the instantiation parameters. The temperature attribute set in the City's constructor remains unchanged, as it is independent from the update_weather method's logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
