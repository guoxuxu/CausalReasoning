  "Explanation": "During winter, the weather_state() function of WeatherSystem returns 'snowy'. According to the mood() function of Population, if the weather is 'snowy', the mood is 'sluggish'. No intervention was needed, this follows directly from the code's causal paths.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
