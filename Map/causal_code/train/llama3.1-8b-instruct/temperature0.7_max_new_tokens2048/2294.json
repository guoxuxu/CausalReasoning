  "Explanation": "A decrease in risk score following an update in smoking status implies that their prior smoker status (which involved a higher risk increment of +50) was changed, thereby lowering the overall risk score due to the lower risk associated with being a non-smoker (+20). This indicates that the person was likely a smoker before the status update.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
