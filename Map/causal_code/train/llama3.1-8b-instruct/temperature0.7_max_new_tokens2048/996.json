  "Explanation": "The total_cost of a Product is calculated as the sum of its price and the tax amount, which is the product of the price and tax rate. Hence, if the tax rate increases, the tax amount will increase, leading directly to an increase in total_cost.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
