  "Explanation": "The intervention of setting has_bonus to True and increasing the bonus_rate directly increases the total_salary. The total_salary in such a scenario is computed as the base_salary plus an additional percentage of the base_salary, which increases as the bonus_rate increases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
