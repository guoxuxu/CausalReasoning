  "Explanation": "An error in adding items correctly to the 'items' list will prevent the corresponding increase in the 'total' as the addition of the item's price to the total is contingent upon successful append operation in 'add_item' method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
