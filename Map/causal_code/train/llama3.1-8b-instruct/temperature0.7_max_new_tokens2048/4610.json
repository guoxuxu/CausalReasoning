  "Explanation": "Even though reversing the transformation (i.e., converting back to the original case and adding any stripped spaces) might provide an approximation, if the string was modified outside basic stripping and lowercasing (like interventions or additional modifications prior to input), the original input can't be fully reconstructed accurately.",
