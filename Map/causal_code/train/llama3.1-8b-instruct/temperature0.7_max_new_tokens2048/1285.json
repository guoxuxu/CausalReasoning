  "Problem": "def weather_effect(temperature): \n    if temperature > 20:\n        mood = 'happy'\n    else:\n        mood = 'sad'\n    if mood == 'happy' and temperature > 25:\n        productivity = 'high'\n    elif mood == 'sad' or temperature <= 25:\n        productivity = 'low'\n    return productivity\n\",\n\nIf an external factor ensures the mood is always 'happy', then will any temperature increase above 25 degrees guarantee high productivity?",
  "Explanation": "With an intervention keeping mood 'happy', crossing the temperature threshold of 25 degrees directly leads to high productivity regardless of the precise temperature as long as it is above 25 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
