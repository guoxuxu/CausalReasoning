  "Explanation": "Manually setting the discount_rate to 0.25 would give a higher percentage increase for the base_sales, pushing forecasted_sales higher. This intervention overrules the lesser impact of discount rates below 0.15, ensuring a sales boost irrespective of the temperature level.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
