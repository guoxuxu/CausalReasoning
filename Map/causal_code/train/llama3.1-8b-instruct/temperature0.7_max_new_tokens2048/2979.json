  "Explanation": "A higher than expected discounted_price suggests a lower discount was applied. With only two discount levels (20% for members, 10% for non-members), a higher price likely indicates the lower discount for non-members was applied, suggesting is_member might be False.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
