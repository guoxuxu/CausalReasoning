  "Problem": "See above\",\n\nIf the `threshold` variable is lowered from 10 to 5, will the `average_result` likely increase?",
  "Explanation": "Lowering the threshold includes more numbers in the processing. This would lead to a potentially higher total sum but definitely increases the count, which could raise the average, depending on how much low-value data is included.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
