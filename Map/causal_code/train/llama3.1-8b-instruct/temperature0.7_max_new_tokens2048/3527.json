  "Problem": "class Car{\n  int speed = 0;\n  boolean engineOn = false;\n  void startEngine() {\n    engineOn = true;\n    speed = 0;\n  }\n  void stopEngine() {\n    engineOn = false;\n    speed = 0;\n  }\n  void accelerate(int increment) {\n    if (engineOn) {\n      speed += increment;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the speed is zero, has the engine necessarily just been turned on?",
  "Explanation": "A speed of zero can occur in multiple scenarios. It happens when the engine is stopped (`stopEngine()` method sets `speed` to zero), when the engine is just turned on (`startEngine()` method also sets `speed` to zero), or if the car was not accelerated after the engine was started. Thus, a zero speed doesn't directly imply that the engine has only just been turned on.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
