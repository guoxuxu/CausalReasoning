  "Explanation": "Given these conditions and outcomes, and knowing no other interventions or external factors are at play (from the provided code), the specific increase by 10 can only be attributed to the scenario where region is 'East' and season is 'Summer' as per the logic defined in the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
