  "Explanation": "Changing the environment to 'rural' changes the growth rate to 1.02 (from 1.05 in 'urban'). This lower growth rate results in a lesser future population compared to the 'urban' scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
