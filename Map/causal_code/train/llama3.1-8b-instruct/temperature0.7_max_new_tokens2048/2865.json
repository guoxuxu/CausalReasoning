  "Explanation": "A max statistic of less than 10 doesn't necessarily imply that the clean_data method was changed to exclude values above 10; it might simply be that the highest value in the original data was below 10 after removing negative values. Without further information about changes to the method or examining original data, this conclusion is unfounded.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
