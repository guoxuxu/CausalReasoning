  "Explanation": "High sport_performance can be due to a combination of both higher weight and height; thus, simply observing high sport_performance doesn't directly imply that height is high. The involvement of both variables complicates direct inference of height solely from sport_performance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
