  "Explanation": "The decrease in size doesn't necessarily indicate that no datum was greater than 3.33; it could be that all original data were marginally below or exactly at 3.33, since tripling such values might have started producing results that are much larger, skipping numbers barely above 10, which could have been included originally.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
