  "Explanation": "A total cost of 7 means that the combined price and shipping cost sum up to 7. Given the logic of the code, the only path to achieving a total of 7 involves a scenario where the price is low enough (at or below 20) to merit a 2 shipping cost, summing together to precisely 7. Any effective discount or significantly different original price would disturb this precise balance, shifting the total cost as a result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
