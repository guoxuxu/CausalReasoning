  "Explanation": "Returning False only means an unsuccessful login attempt; however, the user's account is locked only after 3 consecutive failed attempts. Hence a single function return of False does not necessarily mean the account is already locked.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
