  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'age' in data and data['age'] > 18: \n        adult = True \n    else: \n        adult = False \n    if adult: \n        discount = 0.1 \n    else: \n        discount = 0.2 \n    final_price = data['price'] - data['price'] * discount \n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final_price is less than the initial price, can we conclude the customer is an adult?",
  "Explanation": "The final price being less than the initial price can be due to a discount, which applies for both adults (10% discount) and non-adults (20% discount). The magnitude of the discount alone does not indicate whether the customer is an adult or not.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
