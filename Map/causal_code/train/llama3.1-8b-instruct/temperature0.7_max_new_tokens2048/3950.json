  "Explanation": "In the function, the label 'high' is assigned if the computed result exceeds 50. If 'values' contains very high numbers, the computed result (either average or sum) is likely to exceed this threshold, leading to a 'high' label.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
