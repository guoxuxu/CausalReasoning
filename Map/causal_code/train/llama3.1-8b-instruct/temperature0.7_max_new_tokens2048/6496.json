  "Explanation": "Observing a high evaluation result implicates that many transformed data points exceed the threshold. Given the transformation method used (normalization followed by a logarithmic scaling), this suggests that the original data points were likely higher, to begin with. This causes more points to fall above the threshold post-transformation, which backs the claim in an 'effect to cause without intervention' scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
