  "Problem": "def update_status(temperature, rainfall):\n    if temperature > 30 and rainfall < 10:\n        status = 'drought'\n    elif temperature < 0 and rainfall > 50:\n        status = 'flood'\n    else:\n        status = 'normal'\n    return status\n\ndef send_alert(status):\n    if status == 'drought':\n        alert_sent = True\n    elif status == 'flood':\n        alert_sent = True\n    else:\n        alert_sent = False\n    return alert_sent\",\n\nIf the government implements a policy to irrigate arid areas when a drought status is activated, will this change the effectiveness of the alert system?",
  "Explanation": "The effectiveness of the alert system, as defined in the `send_alert` function, purely depends on the status being 'drought' or 'flood'. The implementation of irrigation does not alter the condition under which alerts are sent, thus it does not affect the alert system's effectiveness.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
