  "Explanation": "Since items are added with positive prices, the presence of items in the cart suggests that the initial sum before any calculations or discounts is non-zero. Thus, having items in the cart logically leads to an assumption of a non-zero initial total.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
