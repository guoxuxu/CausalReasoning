  "Explanation": "Keeping the total_income same while reducing hours_worked below 40 from above suggests that either salary could have increased or hours were managed in such a way that it compensated for the lost income from fewer extra hours. Without explicit changes to rate_increase in the scenario's parameters, indirect effects are insufficient for conclusive causal inference.",
