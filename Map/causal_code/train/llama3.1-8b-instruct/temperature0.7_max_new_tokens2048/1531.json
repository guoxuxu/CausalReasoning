  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data:\n        data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n    if data.get('is_adult') and data['income'] > 30000:\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'high'\n    elif data.get('is_adult') and data['income'] <= 30000:\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'low'\n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'age' field is altered to indicate the person is under 18, will the 'tax_bracket' field necessarily be absent?",
  "Explanation": "Since the condition to assign 'tax_bracket' depends on 'is_adult' being True, which in turn depends on 'age' field being at least 18, setting 'age' below 18 ensures 'is_adult' is False, hence 'tax_bracket' will never be assigned.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
