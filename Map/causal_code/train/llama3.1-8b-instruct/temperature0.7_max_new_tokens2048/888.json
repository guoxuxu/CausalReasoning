  "Explanation": "In the original code, the air quality index is set higher when the factory is operational (150 or 200 depending on initial status or update status, respectively) compared to when it is not operational (50 or 40 respectively). Thus, switching the factory from operational to non-operational will lower the air quality index.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
