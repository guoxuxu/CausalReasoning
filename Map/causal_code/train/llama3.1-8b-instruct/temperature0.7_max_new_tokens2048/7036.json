  "Explanation": "If the reaction speed is already 'unstable' due to the temperature being above 100, merely reducing the temperature below 100 won’t change the reaction speed to 'medium' or 'low' as it does not retroactively alter the pressure settings (unless pressure also falls within the new medium or low range each needing a specific intervention on pressure as well).",
