  "Explanation": "The updateSteps method increases the step count and automatically calls calculateCalories, which recalculates the calories burned based on the new step count. Thus, walking more steps directly leads to an increase in calories burned without any manual intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
