  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\n    x = input_data['temperature']\n    y = input_data['humidity']\n    if x > 30:\n        z = x * 0.9\n    else:\n        z = x * 1.1\n    w = y / 2\n    result = z + w\n    return result\",\n\nIf the process_data function returns a very low result and humidity is known to be zero, can we conclude that temperature was also low?",
  "Explanation": "With humidity set to zero, w becomes 0, meaning the result solely depends on z, which is directly calculated from the temperature with a consistent factor (either 0.9 or 1.1). A very low result implies that z (and hence the temperature) must also be low because there is no other contributing factor to the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
