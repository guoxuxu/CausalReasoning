  "Explanation": "In the code, the first decision branch checks if 'user_click' is True. If it is False, irrespective of the 'db_status', the function will directly return 'no_action'. This is a simple case of 'cause to effect without intervention' where the cause is the user not clicking, leading directly to the effect of obtaining 'no_action' as a return.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the user does not click, the function will always return 'no_action' because user_click directly causes update_database and db_status, and db_status directly causes update_database and result, but user_click does not cause result directly, and db_status causes delayed or update_started, but not no_action."
