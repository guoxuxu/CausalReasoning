  "Explanation": "Given the conditions in the 'car_speed' method, a car moves only if its corresponding traffic light is green. So observing a car moving implies that its traffic light must have been set to green, either before or during the operation that set the car's speed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
