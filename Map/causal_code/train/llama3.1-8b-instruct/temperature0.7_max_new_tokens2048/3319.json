  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, demand, tax_rate):\n    tax = price * demand * tax_rate\n    final_sales = price * demand + tax\n    return final_sales\",\n\nObserving an increase in final_sales, can we deduce that demand must have increased if we don’t know anything about changes in price or tax_rate?",
  "Explanation": "The increase in final_sales could be due to an increase in either price or demand, or a reduction in tax_rate, or a combination of these factors. Since the code shows final_sales is dependent on multiple variables (price, demand, tax_rate), an increase in final_sales cannot conclusively imply an increase in demand without additional information about the other variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
