  "Explanation": "Within the code, a method `checkRainCondition` is called whenever the weather is updated. This method sets `isRainy` to true if the temperature is below 20 degrees, thus directly causing rainy weather when the temperature is low enough, without any other intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
