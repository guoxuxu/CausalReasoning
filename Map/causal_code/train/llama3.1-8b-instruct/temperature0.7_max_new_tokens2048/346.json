  "Explanation": "While a low hydration level (below 50) does prevent exercising, not exercising does not necessarily mean that the hydration level is below 50. There could be other reasons for not exercising that are not covered in this code snippet. The individual might simply choose not to exercise or could be prevented due to other unspecified rules.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "not exercising → hydration level below 50; hydration level below 50 → is not exercising; hydration level below 50 → hydration level < 50; is exercising → hydration level above 50; hydration level above 50 → is exercising"
