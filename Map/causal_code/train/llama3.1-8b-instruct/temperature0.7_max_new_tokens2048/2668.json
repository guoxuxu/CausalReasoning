  "Explanation": "Currently, the function only processes even numbers. Modifying it to process odd numbers by appending 'datum * 3' when detecting an odd datum means that, for any odd number in the input list, a corresponding processed value will be added to the 'processed' list, ensuring the output list is no longer empty.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
