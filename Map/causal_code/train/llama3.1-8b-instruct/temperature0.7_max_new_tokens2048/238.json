  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data.get('x', 0)\n    y = x * 2\n    data['y'] = y\n    z = y + 10\n    data['z'] = z\n    return data\",\n\nIf the value of 'z' in the output is higher, does this mean the value of 'x' was definitely higher?",
  "Explanation": "Though a higher 'z' suggests 'y' was likely higher, contributing factors are linear, but an unknown additional data mutation before calling 'process_data' or within could artificially modify 'y' or 'z', breaking the direct causality from 'x' to 'z'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
