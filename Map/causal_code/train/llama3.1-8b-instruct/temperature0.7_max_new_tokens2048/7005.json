  "Explanation": "Observing rain (isRaining being true) suggests that temperature must be above 0 because rain can only occur in these conditions as per the logic implemented in the code. Therefore, an external intervention that ensures these conditions, or a call to `startRain()` after ensuring the temperature is above zero, could be inferred.",
