  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'discount' in data:\n        price = data['price'] * (1 - data['discount'])\n    else:\n        price = data['price']\n    if price > 20:\n        shipping = 5\n    else:\n        shipping = 2\n    total_cost = price + shipping\n    return total_cost\",\n\nIf we were to intervene and set all prices in the input data above 20, would this always result in a total_cost higher than 7?",
  "Explanation": "By intervening to ensure that all input prices are above 20, the function logic dictates that a shipping cost of 5 will invariably apply. The minimum price being just over 20 with the additional shipping results in a minimum total cost just over 25, which is always higher than 7.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
