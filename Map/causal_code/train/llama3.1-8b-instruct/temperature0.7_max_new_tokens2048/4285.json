  "Problem": "def calculate_revenue(prices, units_sold, tax_rate):\n    base_revenue = sum([price * units for price, units in zip(prices, units_sold)])\n    tax = base_revenue * tax_rate\n    final_revenue = base_revenue + tax\n    return final_revenue\",\n\nIf 'final_revenue' decreases after setting 'tax_rate' to zero, does this imply a reduction in 'prices'?",
  "Explanation": "With 'tax_rate' set to zero, any change in 'final_revenue' directly reflects changes in 'base_revenue', which is directly dependent on 'prices' and 'units_sold'. A decrease in 'final_revenue' therefore implies either a decrease in 'prices' or 'units_sold', assuming one of these must have been reduced, given the intervention (no tax).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
