  "Explanation": "The only pathway to receive a 'no action' result is either the user_type being invalid or 'login failed', which would only occur on an incorrect or unhandled login state (likely from intervention or incorrect credentials).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
