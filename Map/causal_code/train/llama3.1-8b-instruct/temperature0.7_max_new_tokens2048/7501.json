  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(daily_sales, tax_rate, discount_policy):\n    if discount_policy == 'holiday':\n        discount_rate = 0.2\n    else:\n        discount_rate = 0\n    total_sales = sum(daily_sales)\n    if total_sales > 1000:\n        discount_rate += 0.05\n    tax_amount = total_sales * tax_rate\n    discount_amount = total_sales * discount_rate\n    final_amount = total_sales + tax_amount - discount_amount\n    return final_amount\",\n\nIf the discount_policy is set to 'holiday', will the final_amount decrease for the same daily_sales and tax_rate?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the discount policy to 'holiday' increases the discount rate to 0.2 (which could be further incremented by 0.05 if conditions are met). This increased discount rate reduces the final amount due to higher discount amount being subtracted from the total sales including taxes.",
