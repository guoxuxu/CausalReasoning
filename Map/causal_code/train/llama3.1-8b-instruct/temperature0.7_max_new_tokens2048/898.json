  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(prices, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        discount_rate = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount_rate = 0.05\n    discounted_prices = [price * (1 - discount_rate) for price in prices]\n    return discounted_prices\",\n\nIf we force the discount rate to 0.15, will this lead to lower overall discounted prices regardless of the season?",
  "Explanation": "Forcing a discount rate of 0.15 will increase the discount applied to the prices compared to the default rates set in the code for summer (0.1) and other seasons (0.05). This intervention leads directly to a decrease in discounted prices irrespective of the season.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
