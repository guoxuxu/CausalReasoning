  "Explanation": "Health index is influenced by age, random variation, and exercise frequency. Even if health index is controlled above 85, it does not precisely determine the exercise frequency due to the presence of other contributing factors like age and inherent randomness.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
