  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data): \n    if data['holiday'] == True: \n        sales = data['base_sales'] * 1.5 \n    else: \n        sales = data['base_sales'] \n    if data['weather'] == 'rainy': \n        sales *= 0.8 \n    return sales\",\n\nObserving a decrease in sales, can we assume there was rainy weather on that day?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in sales could be influenced by rainy weather but could also be due to it not being a holiday or other unaccounted factors. Decline in sales alone cannot definitively point to bad weather unless that's the only variable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
