  "Explanation": "Calling the update_temperature method with a positive change increases the temperature. If this updated temperature exceeds 30, the alert state is set to 'High'. Since the initial temperature was 20 and with a positive change of 15 it reaches 35, the alert is 'High'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
