  "Explanation": "The message only indicates whether the variance exceeds 15 and does not provide specific information about the exact numbers within the input data, given that multiple configurations of data can lead to the same variance measure.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
