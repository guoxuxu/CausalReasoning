  "Explanation": "The function compute_interest works in a forward-processing manner, calculating the interest based on the existing account balance, interest rate, and time without back-propagation mechanisms. If final_interest is set, it does not inherently modify any initial inputs such as initial_balance; instead, adjustments needed would have to be calculated manually or with a different algorithm configured for this purpose.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
