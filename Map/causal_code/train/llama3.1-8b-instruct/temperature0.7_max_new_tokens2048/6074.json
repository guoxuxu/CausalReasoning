It also includes a method to check if the user can rent a car, which depends solely on their driving license status.\"\n  },\n\nIf it is known that a user has a driving license due to a recent policy intervention, can we deduce their specific age?",
  "Explanation": "The introduction of the policy that issues a driving license irrespective of age means that having a driving license is no longer age-dependent. Therefore, knowing a user has a driving license does not provide any information about their age, as this effect (having a driving license) no longer uniquely identifies the cause (user's age) due to the policy change.",
