  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private double temperature; public WeatherSimulator(double temp) { temperature = temp; } public void adjustTemperature(double delta) { temperature += delta; } public boolean willItRain() { return temperature < 20; } public double getTemperature() { return temperature; } }\",\n\nIf the temperature was initially set at 25 degrees and later the temperature was adjusted by a delta of -10, will willItRain method return true?",
  "Explanation": "The initial setup had the temperature at 25, which is above the threshold of 20. However, after applying an intervention by adjusting the temperature with a delta of -10, the new temperature becomes 15 degrees. Since this is below 20, willItRain will return true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
