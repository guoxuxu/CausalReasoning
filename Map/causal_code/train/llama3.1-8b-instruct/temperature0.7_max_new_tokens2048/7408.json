  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data):\n  if data['weekday'] in ['Saturday', 'Sunday']:\n    adjustment_factor = 1.1\n  else:\n    adjustment_factor = 0.9\n  base_sales = data['base_sales']\n  adjusted_sales = base_sales * adjustment_factor\n  if adjusted_sales > 1000:\n    discount = 0.05\n  else:\n    discount = 0.02\n  final_price = adjusted_sales * (1 - discount)\n  return final_price\",\n\nIf the `final_price` observed is particularly high, can we intervene to deduce that `base_sales` were also high?",
  "Explanation": "A high `final_price` results from interplay between `base_sales`, `adjustment_factor`, and `discount`. While high `base_sales` can contribute, other factors like weekend adjustments (with higher `adjustment_factor`) or differences in applied `discounts` may also drive higher `final_price`. Thus, directly inferring high `base_sales` from a high `final_price` isn't always reliable without more specific data on other contributing variables.",
