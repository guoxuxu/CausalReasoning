  "Explanation": "Setting 'user_score' to 70 results in a 'score' of 80 after adding 10. Since 80 is greater than 75, the 'status' will be set to 'high'. This is a direct manipulation of 'user_score' leading to a predictable change in 'status', demonstrating an intervention that modifies the cause ('user_score') to influence the effect ('status').",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
