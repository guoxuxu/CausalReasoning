  "Explanation": "If get_alert returns 'Low', it indicates that the alert state was set to 'Low'. This state is only set if the temperature falls below 10. Since the temperature starts from 20, a negative change that significantly reduces the temperature below 10 would result in a 'Low' alert.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
