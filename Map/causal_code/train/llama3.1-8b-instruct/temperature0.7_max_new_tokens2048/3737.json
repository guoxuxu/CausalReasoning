  "Explanation": "An increase in sales could be due simply to an increase in the quantity sold without promotions activated, or due to promotions. The sales increase alone without knowing quantity or the promotional status doesn't unequivocally indicate that promotions were activated.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
