  "Explanation": "Modifying the `sell_tickets` method to eliminate the budget requirement for selling premium tickets removes a constraint on premium ticket sales. This adjustment would likely enable the selling of more premium tickets regardless of the budget state, as it intervenes to alter the direct conditions under which premium tickets are sold.",
