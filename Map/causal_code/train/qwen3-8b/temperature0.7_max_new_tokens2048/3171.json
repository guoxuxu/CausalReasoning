  "Problem": "[See above Python code snippet]\",\n\nIf we observe increased plant growth, can we infer that there was definitely an increase in sunlight?",
  "Explanation": "Increased plant growth could be due to increased water or a combination of both sunlight and water. It is not solely dependent on sunlight.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
