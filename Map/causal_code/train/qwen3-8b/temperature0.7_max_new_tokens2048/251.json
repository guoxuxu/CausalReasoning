  "Explanation": "The intervention only affects the initial state of daily steps. If within a single day the step count exceeds 10000 steps, the 'lose_weight' method will still be called, leading to weight loss.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
