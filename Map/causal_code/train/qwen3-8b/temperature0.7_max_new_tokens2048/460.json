  "Explanation": "Light traffic indicates a green signal, but this does not necessarily mean there was manual intervention. It could be a non-rainy day (isRaining is false) where the signal defaulted to green without any manual change. Therefore, light traffic does not exclusively imply manual intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
