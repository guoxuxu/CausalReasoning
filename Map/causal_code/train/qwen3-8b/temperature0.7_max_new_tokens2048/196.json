  "Explanation": "The total price is a result of the prices of all products and the current discount rate, but adjusting the total price calculation itself (e.g., by directly setting a different total) does not affect the discount rate. Any change in total price seen via the 'getTotalPrice' method does not intrinsically alter the discount rate, as these are calculated values, not causal inputs.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
