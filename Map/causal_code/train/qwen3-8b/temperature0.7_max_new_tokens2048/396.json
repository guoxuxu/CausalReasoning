  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data): \n    modified_data = input_data * 2 \n    final_data = modified_data + 10 \n    return final_data \n\nuser_input = 20 \nresult = process_data(user_input)\",\n\nKnowing that an external function changes the user_input by multiplying it with -1 before it is passed to process_data, can we infer that final_data changed because of the sign change in user_input?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying user_input by -1 before passing it to process_data inverts the sign of the input, thereby affecting modified_data calculation as negative and thus altering the result in final_data. The overall logic and computation sequence in process_data suggest this dependency directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
