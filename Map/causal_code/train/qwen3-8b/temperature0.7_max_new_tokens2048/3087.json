  "Explanation": "Being at risk is determined by either having a blood pressure over 140 or being over the age of 55. Therefore, merely being at risk does not provide sufficient information to conclude that it is solely due to age; the high blood pressure could also be a factor.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
