  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(prices, discounts, tax_rate): \n    discounted_prices = [p - (p * d) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)] \n    taxed_prices = [dp * (1 + tax_rate) for dp in discounted_prices] \n    total_sales = sum(taxed_prices) \n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf the list of discounts increases, will the total_sales definitely decrease?",
  "Explanation": "While increasing discounts generally means lower prices, which might suggest lower total sales, the actual effect on total sales also depends on the tax rate applied after the discounts. Additionally, consumer behavior in response to lower prices (e.g., buying more products) is not accounted for in the code but could potentially lead to increased total sales despite higher discounts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
