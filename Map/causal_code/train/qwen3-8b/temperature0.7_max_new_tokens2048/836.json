  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data * 5\n    y = x + 10\n    if y > 50:\n        z = True\n    else:\n        z = False\n    return {'x': x, 'y': y, 'z': z}\n\nresult = process_data(10)\",\n\nIf the data is increased, will the value of 'y' definitely increase, without any other changes to the code?",
  "Explanation": "In the given code, 'y' is directly dependent on 'x', which itself is a product of 'data' multiplied by 5. As the 'data' increases, 'x' increases linearly, and so does 'y' because 10 is just a constant addition, making the relationship between 'data' and 'y' also a linear increase without any intervention needed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
