  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data * 5\n    y = x + 10\n    if y > 50:\n        z = True\n    else:\n        z = False\n    return {'x': x, 'y': y, 'z': z}\n\nresult = process_data(10)\",\n\nIf we force 'z' to always be True, will any changes to 'data' affect 'y'?",
  "Explanation": "If 'z' is forced to always be True irrespective of the value of 'y', this modification breaks the conditional dependency between 'y' and 'z'. Hence, changes in 'data' will still affect 'y', but this relationship is obscured by the intervention on 'z'. In this altered scenario, 'z' does not reflect changes in 'y' or 'data', disconnecting the observed effect of 'data' on the implications derived from 'z'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
