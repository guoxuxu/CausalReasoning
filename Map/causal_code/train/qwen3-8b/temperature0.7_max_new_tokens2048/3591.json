  "Explanation": "John's final health status can be influenced by both the environment's pollution level and his diet quality. Knowing only the health status ('Poor', 'Fair', or 'Good') does not provide enough information to conclusively determine the specific pollution level.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
