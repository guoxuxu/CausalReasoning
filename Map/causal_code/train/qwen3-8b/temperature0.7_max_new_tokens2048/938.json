  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  processed_data = normalize(data)\n  if should_augment(data):\n    augmented_data = augment(data)\n    return combine(processed_data, augmented_data)\n  else:\n    return processed_data\n\n def normalize(data):\n  return [x / max(data) for x in data]\n\n def augment(data):\n  return [x + 1 for x in data]\n\n def should_augument(data):\n  return len(data) > 10\n\n def combine(a, b):\n  return a + b\",\n\nIf we modify the definition of 'should_augment' to always return True, will it guarantee that 'augment' will always be employed by 'process_data'?",
  "Explanation": "By intervening to change the body of 'should_augment' to always return True, we're ensuring that regardless of data length, the condition to execute 'augment' in 'process_data' will always be met. This is a clear causal direction from the intervention (modifying 'should_augment') to the effect ('augment' being employed).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
