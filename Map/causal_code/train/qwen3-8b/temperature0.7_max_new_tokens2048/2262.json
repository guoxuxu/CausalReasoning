  "Explanation": "Setting the weather_status to 'Arid' as an intervention doesn't necessarily indicate the natural cause (e.g., temperature). An external interference in status does not reveal the reason behind such a status; the condition could be due to low humidity (< 30) or low temperature (< -5) alone, or a combination of any.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
