  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data): \n    if data['promotion'] and data['season'] == 'Summer':\n        sales_increase = 15\n    elif data['promotion'] and data['season'] != 'Summer':\n        sales_increase = 10\n    else:\n        sales_increase = 5\n    final_sales = data['initial_sales'] + sales_increase\n    return final_sales\",\n\nIf 'final_sales' shows a 15 unit increase, can we conclude the season was necessarily Summer?",
  "Explanation": "While a 15 unit increase is indicative of a Summer season with a promotion, the presence of a promotion under other circumstances might also cause different increases. Without explicit season data or discounting other possible increases, this cannot be concluded definitively.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
