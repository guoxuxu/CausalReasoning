  "Explanation": "While heavy traffic does lead to a high stress level which in combination with a mood that is not good (caused by non-sunny weather) and less than 2 cups of coffee results in poor performance, it's not certain that the traffic condition was heavy as a moderate traffic with similar other conditions can still result in poor performance if stress was already high for unrelated reasons (not explicitly captured in the code).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
