  "Explanation": "John feeling 'Happy' correlates with warm weather, but an intervention to guarantee the temperature above 20 degrees based on John's feeling is not necessarily achievable through the information on his feelings alone. Other unobserved factors could influence local weather regardless of John's emotional state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
