  "Explanation": "A reduction in daily steps due to an external intervention (like illness or limited mobility) could change the recommendation from 'Well done on active lifestyle' or 'Maintain' to 'Increase walking', as the recommendation adjusts according to the updated daily steps.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
