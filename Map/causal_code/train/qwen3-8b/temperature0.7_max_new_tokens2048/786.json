  "Problem": "class WeatherController {\n  int temperature;\n  boolean isRaining;\n\n  WeatherController(int temp, boolean rain) {\n    this.temperature = temp;\n    this.isRaining = rain;\n  }\n\n  String getWeatherStatus() {\n    if (temperature > 20 && !isRaining) {\n      return \"Sunny\";\n    } else if (temperature <= 20 && isRaining) {\n      return \"Rainy\";\n    }\n    return \"Cloudy\";\n  }\n\n  void temperatureRise(int increase) {\n    this.temperature += increase;\n    if (this.temperature > 30) {\n      this.isRaining = false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  void simulateRain() {\n    this.isRaining = true;\n    if (this.temperature > 20) {\n      this.temperature -= 5;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf an external intervention keeps the weather constantly raining, will heating the temperature above 30 still result in Sunny weather?",
  "Explanation": "Even if the temperature rises above 30 degrees, the intervention that causes constant raining overrides the usual behavior set by the `temperatureRise` function where `isRaining` is set to false, thereby keeping the status either 'Rainy' or 'Cloudy' despite the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
