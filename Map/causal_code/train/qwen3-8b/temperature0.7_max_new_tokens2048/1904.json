  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data and data['age'] > 30:\n        data['category'] = 'Adult'\n    else:\n        data['category'] = 'Young'\n    if data.get('income', 0) > 50000:\n        data['status'] = 'High-Income'\n    else:\n        data['status'] = 'Low-Income'\n    return data\",\n\nIf after modifying the data's age to an unknown value, the person remains categorized as 'Adult', can we assume the new age is definitely over 30?",
  "Explanation": "The categorization as 'Adult' is strictly due to the age being greater than 30. If after manipulating the age value, the category remains 'Adult', it directly implies that the modified age met the condtional requirement (age > 30). Hence, the new age must be over 30.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
