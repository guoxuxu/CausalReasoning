  "Problem": "def compute_score(data): \n    if data['experience'] > 5:\n        score = 20 \n    else:\n        score = 10\n    if data['certified']:\n        score += 30\n    return score\n\nemployee_data = {'experience': 8, 'certified': True}\nscore = compute_score(employee_data)\",\n\nDoes having more than 5 years of experience increase the score?",
  "Explanation": "The function `compute_score` assigns a base score of 20 if the 'experience' in the data dictionary is greater than 5, compared to 10 if it is 5 or less. Thus, having more than 5 years of experience does indeed increase the score.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
