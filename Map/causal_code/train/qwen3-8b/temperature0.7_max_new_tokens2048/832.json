  "Problem": "class Experiment { int temp; double reactionRate; void increaseTemp() { temp += 5; if (temp > 100) reactionRate *= 2; else reactionRate += 10; } void decreaseReaction() { if (reactionRate > 20) { reactionRate -= 5; temp -= 3; } } }\",\n\nIf the temperature of the experiment goes above 100, will the reaction rate necessarily double?",
  "Explanation": "In the method 'increaseTemp()', there is a conditional statement which checks if the temperature exceeds 100. If it does, the reaction rate is doubled. Therefore, if the condition of the temperature exceeding 100 is met, the reaction rate will inevitably double.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
