  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    temperature = data.get('temp', 0) \n    humidity = data.get('humidity', 0) \n    adjusted_temp = temperature * 1.8 + 32 \n    comfort_index = adjusted_temp - 0.55 * (1 - humidity / 100) * (adjusted_temp - 58) \n    is_comfortable = comfort_index > 65 and humidity < 80 \n    return is_comfortable\",\n\nIf the 'is_comfortable' flag is true, can we infer that the original temperature was high?",
  "Explanation": "The 'is_comfortable' flag being true depends on both a suitable 'comfort_index' and humidity below 80%. The 'comfort_index' is influenced by both temperature and humidity. A cool environment with very low humidity can also produce a comfortable index above 65. Hence, a true 'is_comfortable' flag doesn't necessarily mean the temperature was high; it could also mean that humidity was managed well relative to a moderate temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
