  "Explanation": "An increase in the result's 'length' could be due to various reasons such as more non-empty strings in the input `data` itself or changes in other functions like `enrich`. Without knowing more about specific changes to the `clean` function or the nature of the input, this conclusion cannot be definitively drawn.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
