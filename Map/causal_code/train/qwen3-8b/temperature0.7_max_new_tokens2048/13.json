  "Explanation": "The humidity decreases as a side effect of the temperature increasing due to the adjust_humidity method being called within increase_temperature. Without the increase_temperature call, there's no automatic reduction in humidity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
