  "Explanation": "Even though setting the season to 'summer' could affect the temperature and humidity, reversing the outcome of `is_rainy()` from True to False isn't certain without knowing the specific changes that the intervention of setting the season to 'summer' entails. It depends if the new temperature and humidity values still meet the conditions for `is_rainy()` to return True. Hence, intervention from the effect to cause is uncertain without knowing the specifics of how 'summer' adjustment impacts the attributes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
