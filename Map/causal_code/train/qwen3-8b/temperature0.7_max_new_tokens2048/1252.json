  "Problem": "def calculate_health(age, smoking_status, exercise_freq):\n    base_health = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health -= (age - 50) * 0.5\n    if smoking_status:\n        base_health -= 20\n    if exercise_freq >= 3:\n        base_health += 15\n    return base_health\",\n\nIf a person is over 50 years old, will their health score decrease without further intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The function decreases the base health by 0.5 for each year over 50. This is a direct effect of age on health without any intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
