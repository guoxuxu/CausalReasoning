  "Explanation": "While 'error' in the data dictionary initially sets the status to 'FAIL', the presence of the 'retry' key with a value of True can change the status from 'FAIL' to 'RETRY'. Therefore, the final status might not always be 'FAIL'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
