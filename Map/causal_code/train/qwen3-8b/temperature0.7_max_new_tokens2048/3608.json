  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'error' in data:\n        return 'Error detected'\n    processed = normalize(data['value'])\n    result = compute_score(processed)\n    if result > 50:\n        return 'High'\n    else:\n        return 'Low'\n\ndef normalize(value):\n    return value / 100\n\ndef compute_score(normalized_value):\n    score = normalized_value * 100\n    if score > 70:\n        return 80\n    else:\n        return 40\",\n\nIf the normalize function is modified to divide by 200 instead of 100, will scores generally decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the normalize function affects how 'value' is divided—increasing the divisor decreases the resultant normalized value passed to compute_score. Since compute_score multiplies the input by 100, reducing the normalized value would lead to lower scores overall, impacting resulting classifications ('High' or 'Low').",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
