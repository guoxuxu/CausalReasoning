  "Explanation": "Setting all ages to a constant value effectively removes the variation in age. Since `risk_factor` calculation is directly proportional to `age` (age multiplied by 0.2), this would result in the same `risk_factor` for every entry, removing variability in `risk_factor` values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
