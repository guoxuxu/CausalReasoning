  "Explanation": "A reduced price in the cart items could be due to the originally scripted random discount or an administrator's intervention. Without additional information, one cannot conclusively determine the cause of the reduced price (random discount or manual intervention). This question deals with the potential confusion between an observed effect (price reduction) potentially caused by two different mechanisms.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
