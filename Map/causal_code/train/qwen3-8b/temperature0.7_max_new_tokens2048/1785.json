  "Problem": "def update_inventory(products, sold, restocked):\n    inventory = {product: stock for product, stock in products.items()}\n    for product in sold:\n        if product in inventory:\n            inventory[product] -= sold[product]\n    for product in restocked:\n        if product in inventory:\n            inventory[product] += restocked[product]\n    return inventory\",\n\nIf it is observed that inventory levels for a product are unusually high, can we conclude that restocking activities were recently augmented for that product?",
  "Explanation": "While increased restocking can cause high inventory levels, observing high inventory (effect) alone doesn't conclusively point to augmented restocking (cause) because several factors such as reduced sales or previous overstock could also be responsible. This intricate relationship from effect back to cause with the possibility of intervention highlights the importance of considering multiple causal paths.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
