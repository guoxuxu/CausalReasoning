  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { void simulate(int days, boolean rainySeason) { for(int i = 0; i < days; i++) { if(rainySeason) { System.out.println('Rain'); } else { if(Math.random() > 0.5) { System.out.println('Sun'); } else { System.out.println('Cloudy'); } } } } }\",\n\nIf you modify the simulation to override the Math.random() result to always return 0.6 during a non-rainy season, will it always print 'Sun'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting Math.random() to always return 0.6 during non-rainy seasons will bypass the 50% chance decision schema, thereby always causing 'Sun' to be printed under those conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
