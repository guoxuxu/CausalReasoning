  "Explanation": "Setting all 'cars' values to zero means the analyze_traffic function will result in a total traffic count of zero. Thus, the condition to set peak_hours to True (traffic > 40) will never be met, guaranteeing that peak_hours remains False.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
