  "Explanation": "Even if the students in classroom are reduced to 10, the activity_status will still not change to 'Teacher waiting' as long as the teacher remains present and there is at least one student. The condition for 'Teacher waiting' is that there must be zero students.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
