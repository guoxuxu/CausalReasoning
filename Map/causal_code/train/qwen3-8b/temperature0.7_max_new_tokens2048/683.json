  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'temperature' in data:\n        temperature = data['temperature']\n        if temperature > 20:\n            mood = 'happy'\n        else:\n            mood = 'sad'\n    return mood\n\nresponse = process_data({'temperature': 25})\",\n\nIf mood is set to a value externally, can this alter the value of temperature in input data?",
  "Explanation": "Mood is an output based on temperature; it purely depends on the temperature given in data. Setting mood externally will not feedback and modify the input data’s temperature because the causality is unidirectional from temperature to mood in this code structure, and mood is not used to redefine temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
