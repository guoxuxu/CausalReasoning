  "Explanation": "Directly modifying the balance to increase it prior to a withdrawal operation can affect the outcome by making more funds available for withdrawal. This direct intervention increases the likelihood that the withdrawal will be successful, as there are sufficient funds to cover the requested amount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
