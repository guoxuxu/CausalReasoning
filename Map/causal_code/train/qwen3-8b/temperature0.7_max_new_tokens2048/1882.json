  "Explanation": "Setting the fuel level to 5 only meets one precondition for the engine to be running. The engine status also depends on whether the method start_engine() is explicitly called after setting the fuel level.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
