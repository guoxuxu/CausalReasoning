  "Explanation": "Establishing a method to manually set weather conditions interrupts the assumed causality between temperature and rain as depicted in the original code. This intervention means the rain can occur independently of the temperature threshold logic built in the increaseTemperature and decreaseTemperature methods.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
