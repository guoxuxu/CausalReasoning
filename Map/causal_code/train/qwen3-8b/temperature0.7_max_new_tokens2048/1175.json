  "Explanation": "Once 'No need for heating.' is printed, indicating `heating_on` is False, changing `current_outdoor_temp` at this point won't demonstrate it was necessarily higher than 15 during the decision-making process as the condition has already been assessed and acted upon.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
