  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n\\t processed_data = [x * 2 for x in data if x > 10] \n\\t return processed_data\n\ndata = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] \nresult = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf the list 'data' contains only values less than 10, will 'processed_data' be empty?",
  "Explanation": "The list comprehension in 'process_data' filters elements that are greater than 10 and doubles them. If all values in 'data' are less than 10, this filter condition is never true, so no elements will be processed or added to 'processed_data'. Thus, 'processed_data' will be empty.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
