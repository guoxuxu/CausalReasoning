  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  if data['year'] >= 2020:\n    data['status'] = 'recent'\n  else:\n    data['status'] = 'old'\n  if data['score'] > 80:\n    data['evaluation'] = 'high'\n  else:\n    data['evaluation'] = 'low'\n  return data\",\n\nIf we observe the 'evaluation' is 'high', can we be certain the 'score' was above 80?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, the 'evaluation' is set to 'high' only if the 'score' is above 80. There are no other conditions affecting 'evaluation', so observing 'high' necessarily implicates a 'score' above 80, deducing from effect to cause without other interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
