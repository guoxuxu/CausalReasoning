  "Problem": "def update_inventory(products, sold, restocked):\n    inventory = {product: stock for product, stock in products.items()}\n    for product in sold:\n        if product in inventory:\n            inventory[product] -= sold[product]\n    for product in restocked:\n        if product in inventory:\n            inventory[product] += restocked[product]\n    return inventory\",\n\nDoes a decrease in the final inventory indicate an increase in the number of items sold for that product?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in final inventory count can result from increased sales but can also be influenced by absence or lesser frequency of restocking. Without information on restocking, decreases in inventory do not definitively imply an increase in sold quantities. This relates to the causal relationship from effect to cause without intervention, issues arise because one effect (lower inventory) can have multiple plausible causes (increased sales, decreased restocking).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
