  "Explanation": "With the 'discount' being fixed, any variation in 'final_price' cannot be attributed to changes in the discount. Thus, if the 'final_price' is observed to be higher, it must be because the underlying 'base_price' or 'sales_tax' increased. Given a constant 'sales_tax', an increase in 'final_price' would indeed suggest that 'base_price' has increased.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
