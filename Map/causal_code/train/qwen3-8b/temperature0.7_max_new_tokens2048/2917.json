  "Explanation": "If an intervention stops emails from being sent to addresses in the `subscribers` list, observing email sending activities cannot conclusively determine the presence of any specific email in the `subscribers` list since it's assumed they are blocked.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
