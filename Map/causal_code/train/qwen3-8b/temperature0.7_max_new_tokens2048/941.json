  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private int temperature; private boolean isRaining; public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean rain) { temperature = temp; isRaining = rain; } public void increaseTemperature() { temperature += 5; if (temperature > 30) { isRaining = false; } } public boolean willRain() { return isRaining && temperature < 25; } }\",\n\nIf it's not raining, can we infer that the temperature was increased?",
  "Explanation": "There could be other reasons for it not raining, such as the initial state where the temperature was already above 30°C or if it was already not raining independently of the temperature change. Raining cessation is not exclusively caused by a temperature increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
