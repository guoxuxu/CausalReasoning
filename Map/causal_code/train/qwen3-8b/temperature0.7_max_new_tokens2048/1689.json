  "Problem": "def compute_sales(discount, quantity, base_price):\n\\tif discount > 0:\n\\t\\tfinal_price = base_price * (1 - discount / 100)\n\\telse:\n\\t\\tfinal_price = base_price\n\\ttotal_sales = final_price * quantity\n\\tsurplus = total_sales * 0.05\n\\treturn total_sales, surplus\n\nsales, extra = compute_sales(10, 50, 20)\",\n\nIf we fix the discount at a higher rate, is it likely that the total sales value will drop?",
  "Explanation": "Fixing the discount at a higher rate lowers unit prices which might actually increase sales volume, potentially compensating for or exceeding the loss in revenue per unit leading to stable or increased total sales values. The intervention increases consumer incentive to purchase more.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
