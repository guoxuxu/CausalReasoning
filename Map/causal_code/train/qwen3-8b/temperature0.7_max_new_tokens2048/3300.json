  "Explanation": "Manually lowering the targetTemperature will cause the currentTemperature to decrease, provided the external temperature is higher than the new, lower targetTemperature. If the external temperature is lower than both the old and new targets, currentTemperature will remain unchanged—equal to the external temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
