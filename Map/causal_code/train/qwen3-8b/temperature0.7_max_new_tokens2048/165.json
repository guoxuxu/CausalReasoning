  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    modified = data * 2\n    if modified > 20:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    return result\",\n\nIf we increase the input data value does the function invariably return True?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the input data does lead to a result of True for inputs greater than 10, but inputs equal to or less than 10 do not meet the condition `modified > 20`, and hence return False.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
