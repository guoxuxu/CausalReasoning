  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'price' in data: \n        discount = data['price'] * 0.1 \n    else: \n        discount = 0 \n    if 'quantity' in data and data['quantity'] > 20: \n        discount += 5 \n    return {'final_price': data['price'] - discount if 'price' in data else 0, 'discount_applied': discount}\",\n\nIf we observe a decrease in 'final_price', can we infer that 'quantity' was increased from 20 or fewer?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'final_price' could also be due to an increase in 'price', which increases the percentage-based discount or changes unrelated to 'quantity'. Thus, 'quantity' isn't necessarily increased from 20 or fewer.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
