  "Explanation": "Heavy traffic occurs when the signal is red. Although the red signal initially is set due to rainfall, the signal can also be manually overridden to red through the manualOverride method, regardless of rain. Thus, heavy traffic could also occur without it raining.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
