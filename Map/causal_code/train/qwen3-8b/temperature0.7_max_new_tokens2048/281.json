  "Problem": "Above Python code\",\n\nIf the occupancy increases, will the internal temperature rise, all other factors being constant?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the occupancy results in a higher heat increment since the adjustment delta relies positively on the external and internal temperature difference, more drastically when external temperature is below 50. Thus, more people contribute to maintaining or even increasing the internal temperature through the adjustment calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
