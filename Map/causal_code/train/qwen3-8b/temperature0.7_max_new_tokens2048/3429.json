  "Problem": "def calculate_health(age, smoker, exercise_freq):\n    base_health = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health -= (age - 50) * 2\n    if smoker:\n        base_health -= 30\n    if exercise_freq >= 3:\n        base_health += 20\n    return base_health\",\n\nAssuming a person has a higher health score after intervention, can we infer the person increased their exercise frequency?",
  "Explanation": "Although increasing exercise frequency positively impacts the health score, a higher score post-intervention does not conclusively indicate that exercise frequency was increased. Other factors such as reduction in age penalty (unlikely but hypothetically considering lifestyle changes or errors in initial age recording) or stopping smoking could also be responsible. Therefore, this doesn't reliably indicate a cause, demonstrating the complexity of inferring specific causes solely from the effect, even with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
