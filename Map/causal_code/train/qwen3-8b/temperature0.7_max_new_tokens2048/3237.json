  "Explanation": "Since the modification happens after the execution of 'process_data', the earlier set 'status' ('failed' or 'success') remains unchanged by this downstream external intervention. Therefore, a 'success' status could indeed exist, provided there was no initial 'error' or ValueError during the execution of 'process_data'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
