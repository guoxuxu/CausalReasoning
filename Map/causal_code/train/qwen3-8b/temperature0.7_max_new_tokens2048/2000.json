  "Explanation": "An order placement alone cannot confirm excessive selling above the existing stock as the only cause, especially considering possible interventions like restocking rules. The order placement could also have originated because the total stock went below 20 at some point, not necessarily due to sales only.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
