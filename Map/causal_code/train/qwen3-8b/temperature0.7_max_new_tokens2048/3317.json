  "Explanation": "If it is known that the season changed to 'low' which has a negative seasonal effect as per the marketing campaign's effectiveness function, it could be a logical inference that even if the economic condition is set to 'good', the negative seasonal impact could be a contributing factor to the decrease in sales. This indicates a complex causal relationship where the intervention in economic condition doesn't fully mitigate the seasonal effect.",
