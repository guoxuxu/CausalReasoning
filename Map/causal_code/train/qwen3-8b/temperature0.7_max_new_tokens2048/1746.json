  "Explanation": "The increase in the mean will cause the standardized scores to generally decrease, but since the removal of values less than -1 in standardized form is also dependent on the mean, increasing the mean alone does not necessarily result in a decrease in the values of cleaned_data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
