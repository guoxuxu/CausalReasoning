  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(balance, rate): \n    interest = balance * rate / 100 \n    return interest \n\nbalance = 5000 \nrate = 5 \ninterest = calculate_interest(balance, rate) \nbalance += interest\",\n\nIf you add a function that adjusts the initial balance based on the final total, will this affect the rate determination in the original code?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a function to manipulate the initial `balance` based on the final total does not impact the `rate` in the existing calculation model in `calculate_interest`. The `rate` is independently set and not dynamically influenced by the balance or its adjustments. Therefore, operations influencing the balance do not directly change how the rate is determined in the current setup.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
