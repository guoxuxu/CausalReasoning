  "Explanation": "From the given code, for people older than 50 with a poor quality diet (diet_quality < 3), their health_index calculates as a multiple of their weight (weight * 0.8). If diet_quality decreases below 3, it fulfills the condition for this different (and typically lower) calculation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
