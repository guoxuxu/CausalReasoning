  "Explanation": "Changing the base price directly impacts the final_cost calculation during the apply_discount method, where final_cost is recalculated based on the new base price minus the same percentage discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
