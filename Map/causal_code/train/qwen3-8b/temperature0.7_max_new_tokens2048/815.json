  "Explanation": "Modifying votesPerCandidate to include a new candidate directly by intervention (outside normal voting mechanism) implies that if the process were correctly followed (i.e., through castVote), it would adjust the totalVotes appropriately. However, direct manipulation of the map without using castVote does not automatically adjust totalVotes, unless this is done as part of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
