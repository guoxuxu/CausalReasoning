  "Explanation": "While providing a substantial amount of water to certain plants (other than Cactus) can increase the growth rate, other factors such as low pollution levels or high sunlight can also contribute to an increase in growth rate. Therefore, an increased growth rate alone does not confirm that the plant received considerable amounts of water.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
