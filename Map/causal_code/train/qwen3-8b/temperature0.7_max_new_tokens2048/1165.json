  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'error' in data:\n        data['status'] = 'fail'\n    else:\n        data['status'] = 'success'\n        if data['processing_time'] > 100:\n            data['priority'] = 'normal'\n        else:\n            data['priority'] = 'high'\n\n    return data\",\n\nIf the status is 'success', can we deduce that the data had no 'error'?",
  "Explanation": "Since the only pathway to set the status to 'success' is the absence of 'error' in the data (as per the if condition), observing a status of 'success' directly implies that there was no 'error' key in the data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
