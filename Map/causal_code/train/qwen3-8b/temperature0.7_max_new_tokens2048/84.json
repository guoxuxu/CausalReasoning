  "Explanation": "Changing the feedback does not affect the weather since the weather is generated and determined independently (`assess_weather` function) before the activity or feedback are considered. The feedback is a reflection of the activity's enjoyment level based on the preset weather condition, but it doesn't influence the weather itself.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
