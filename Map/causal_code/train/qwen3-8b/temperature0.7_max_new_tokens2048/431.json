  "Explanation": "Refueling increases the fuel amount, ensuring that the condition (self.fuel > 0) in 'drive' method is met. Thus, immediately following a refuel with sufficient fuel, a call to 'drive' will certainly increase the speed, given the other conditions are immutable in this context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
