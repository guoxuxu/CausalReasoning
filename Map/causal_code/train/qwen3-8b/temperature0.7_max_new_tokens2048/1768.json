  "Explanation": "By limiting the number of cars to 80, the condition of exceeding 100 cars is not met even during peak hours, thus preventing the triggering of a traffic jam based on the given code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
