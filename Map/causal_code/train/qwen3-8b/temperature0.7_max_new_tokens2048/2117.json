  "Explanation": "The exercise_intervention method explicitly checks if the increase in exercise_level is significantly high (more than 40 minutes), and if so, it actively reduces the heart_rate to counteract potential safety risks. This is a deliberate intervention causing a tailored outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
