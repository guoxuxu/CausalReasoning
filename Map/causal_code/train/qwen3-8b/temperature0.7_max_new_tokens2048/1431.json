  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data): \n    if data['region'] == 'West' and data['season'] == 'Winter':\n        sales_increase = 5\n    elif data['region'] == 'East' and data['season'] == 'Summer':\n        sales_increase = 10\n    else:\n        sales_increase = 0\n    total_sales = data['initial_sales'] + sales_increase\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf the input data indicates the region is 'West' and the season is 'Winter', will the total sales increase?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, when both conditions of region being 'West' and season being 'Winter' are met, sales_increase is set to 5. This directly increases the total_sales by 5 over the initial_sales, which confirms that total sales increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
