  "Explanation": "The increase to 101 in the heart rate and the subsequent alert about 'high_heart_rate' is confined within the local functionalities of the `Update_heart_rate()` method and `alert()` function. External actions like alerting a paramedic are not implicated within these methods and can't be inferred from this change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
