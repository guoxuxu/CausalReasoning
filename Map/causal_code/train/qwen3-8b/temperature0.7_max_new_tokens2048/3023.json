  "Explanation": "A 'buy' decision indicates that both the price is within budget and the quality is above the set threshold. However, this does not necessarily mean the quality was increased. The product might already have sufficient quality from the outset.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
