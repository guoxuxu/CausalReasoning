  "Explanation": "Setting 'coupon_value' to 10 reduces the amount removed from each 'after_discount' price during the coupon application. This results in generally higher 'final_prices' compared to when the coupon value was set higher (e.g., 15), as long as the prices are above the new coupon value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
