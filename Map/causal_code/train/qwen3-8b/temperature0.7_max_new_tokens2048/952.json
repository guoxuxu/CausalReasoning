  "Explanation": "In the original code, the accident rate is set to 0.1 if the weather is 'bad' and to 0.01 if the weather is 'good'. This direct assignment in the Environment's initializer directly links bad weather to a higher accident rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
