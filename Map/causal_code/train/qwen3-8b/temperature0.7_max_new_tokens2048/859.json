  "Explanation": "Resetting the discomfort index to its original value after adjusting temperature could be achieved by various combinations of temperature and humidity adjustments. Therefore, it's impossible to definitively ascertain the original temperature solely based on the index.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
