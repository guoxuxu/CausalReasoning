  "Problem": "def process_orders(order_data):\n    total_items = sum([order['quantity'] for order in order_data])\n    if total_items > 50:\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0\n    total_cost = sum([order['quantity'] * order['price'] * (1 - discount) for order in order_data])\n    return total_cost\",\n\nIf the total cost calculated by the function is very high, does this imply that a large number of items have been ordered?",
  "Explanation": "A high total cost does not necessarily imply a large number of items due to the discount effect. A smaller number of high-priced items, especially if below the discount threshold, can also result in a high total cost.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
