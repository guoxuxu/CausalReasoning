  "Explanation": "A final price can result from various combinations of base price and discount. While a base price of $100 with certain discounts could yield $85, other combinations are possible (e.g., base price of $200 with a 15% discount). Additional information on either the base price or discount rate is required to make a conclusive statement.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
