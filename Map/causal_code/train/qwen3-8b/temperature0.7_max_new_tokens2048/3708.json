  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_threshold): \n    filtered_data = [d for d in data if d['score'] > filter_threshold] \n    summary = {'mean': sum(item['score'] for item in filtered_data) / len(filtered_data)} \n    return summary \ndata = [{'id': 1, 'score': 85}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90}, {'id': 3, 'score': 78}, {'id': 4, 'score': 92}] \nresult = process_data(data, 80)\",\n\nIf you can directly control the entries in 'data', can you influence the 'mean' in the result intentionally?",
  "Explanation": "By adding entries with higher or lower scores into 'data', you can directly affect the calculation of the mean in 'filtered_data', as the mean is computed solely based on the scores that pass the 'filter_threshold'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
