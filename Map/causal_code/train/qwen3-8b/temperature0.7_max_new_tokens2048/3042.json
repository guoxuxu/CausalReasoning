  "Explanation": "The outcome of the traffic lights changing color is not controlled by the number of cars. Instead, 'change_traffic_lights' is manually controlled through its function parameters and does not depend on the car count.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
