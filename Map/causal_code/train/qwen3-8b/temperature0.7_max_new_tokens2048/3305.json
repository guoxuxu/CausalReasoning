  "Explanation": "The music is 'Soft' due to both guests being present and the AC being on. Turning off the AC wouldn't necessarily make the background music 'Loud' as long as guests are still there as it depends on the presence of guests, not just on the state of the AC.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
