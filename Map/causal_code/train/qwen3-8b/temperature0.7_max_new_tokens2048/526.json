  "Explanation": "According to the code, the only scenario where accident_risk is set to 'high' is when the traffic_light is red and it is rainy. Therefore, if the risk is high, the light must be red.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
