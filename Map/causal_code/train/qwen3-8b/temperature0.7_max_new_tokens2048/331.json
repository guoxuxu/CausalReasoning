  "Explanation": "By externally setting 'has_coupon' to false, the method 'apply_coupon' will stop applying an additional 10% discount regardless of other factors. This effectively increases the 'final_price' that a 'premium' customer pays as the additional discount layer is removed in the computation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
