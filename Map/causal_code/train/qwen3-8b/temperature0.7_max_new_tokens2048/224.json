  "Explanation": "No, because intervening and changing the mood to 'happy' disrupts the direct causal chain from weather to mood to activity. Before the intervention, reading typically suggests a 'gloomy' mood, primarily linked to rainy weather, but this causal linkage is broken by the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
