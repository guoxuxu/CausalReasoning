  "Explanation": "If post-processing mean values are consistently close to zero and the data was normalized by dividing by its maximum value, it indicates the common pattern of division by a large number which brings the values closer to zero. This behavior is characteristic of normalization via maximum value division.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
