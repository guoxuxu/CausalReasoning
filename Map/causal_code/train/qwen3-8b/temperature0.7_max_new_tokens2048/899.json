  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(prices, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        discount_rate = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount_rate = 0.05\n    discounted_prices = [price * (1 - discount_rate) for price in prices]\n    return discounted_prices\",\n\nIf we observe that discounted prices are approximately 90% of the original prices, can we infer the season was set to summer?",
  "Explanation": "Observing discounted prices around 90% of original prices indicates a discount rate close to 0.1 (since 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 or 90%) as set in the code for summer. While prices themselves might vary, the percentage indicates a discount rate typical of summer according to the given code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
