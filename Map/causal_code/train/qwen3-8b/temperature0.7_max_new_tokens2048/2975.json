  "Explanation": "Although the commute time is influenced by car speed, which in turn depends on traffic, and traffic depends on weather, the complexity and randomness in determining traffic for 'cloudy' weather make it unreliable to deduce the exact weather condition from commute time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
