  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, customer_loyalty_program): \n\\tif customer_loyalty_program: \n\\t\\teffective_price = price * (1 - discount) \n\\telse: \n\\t\\teffective_price = price \n\\tsales = 1000 if effective_price < 20 else 500 \n\\treturn sales\",\n\nIf we apply a discount, will sales increase under the loyalty program?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a discount reduces the 'effective_price' for customers in the loyalty program, making the price potentially fall below the 20 threshold, thus potentially increasing sales from 500 to 1000, assuming the initial price was borderline around the threshold.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
