  "Problem": "public class HealthSystem { private int health = 100; public void TakeDamage(int damage) { health -= damage; if (health < 0) { health = 0; } } public void Heal(int amount) { health += amount; if (health > 100) { health = 100; } } public int GetHealth() { return health; } }\",\n\nIf the GetHealth method returns 100 after a series of interventions (calling Heal), can we infer that these interventions were necessarily the reason for reaching full health?",
  "Explanation": "While the series of Heal interventions could indeed have resulted in reaching full health, we cannot definitively say they were the only cause as health being at 100 could also result from not taking any damage at all. Other factors might include the absence of damage or initial health being maintained at 100.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
