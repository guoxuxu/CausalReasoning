  "Problem": "int calculateProduct(int a, int b) { return a * b; } int main() { int x = 5; int y = 10; int z = calculateProduct(x, y); int w = z + 10; return w; }\",\n\nIf 'w' decreases due to an intervention, can we assume 'x' or 'y' has decreased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'w' might not reflect a decrease in 'x' or 'y'; it could be the result of a direct intervention that either decreases 'z' independently or changes the additional constant value from 10 to a lower number. Without seeing the specific changes made during intervention, no definitive causal relationship to 'x' or 'y' can be assumed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
