  "Explanation": "The function verify_discount checks the validity of a discount code. If valid, process_order applies a 10% discount to the item price (price *= 0.9). Thus, the validity of the discount code directly affects the final price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
