  "Explanation": "The presence of augmented data in the output indicates that 'augment' was called. From the 'should_augment' function, we know that it only returns True (thus calling 'augment') if the length of 'data' is greater than 10. Thus, observing augmented data implies 'data' had more than 10 elements, establishing causality from the effect (augmented data) back to the cause (data length exceeding 10) without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
