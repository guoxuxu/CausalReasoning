  "Explanation": "When 'process_data' yields a significantly higher mean age, it suggests that the dataset has been modified to either remove younger individuals or predominantly include older individuals. Given that the 'clean_data' function's role includes removing individuals under 18, its intervention directly leads to such a demographic shift in the dataset, assuming no other variables have been altered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
