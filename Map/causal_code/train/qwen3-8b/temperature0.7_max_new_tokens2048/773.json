  "Explanation": "If it is observed that 'is_raining' is True, according to the code, this happens when 'cloud_coverage' is greater than 50. Hence, raining can be used to predict higher cloud coverage, explaining a causal relation from effect to cause without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
