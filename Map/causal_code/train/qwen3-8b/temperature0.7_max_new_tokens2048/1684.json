  "Problem": "def compute_scores(temperature, pressure):\n    if temperature > 100:\n        score = 20\n    else:\n        score = 10\n    if pressure > 5:\n        score += 15\n    else:\n        score += 5\n    return score\",\n\nIf observing an increased score, can it be inferred that the temperature was definitely beyond 100 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "An increased score could also be due to increased pressure (pressure > 5) resulting in score addition of 15. Hence, the increase in score does not uniquely determine that the temperature was beyond 100 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
