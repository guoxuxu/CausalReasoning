  "Problem": "int calculateInterest(int principal, int rate, int time) { int interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100; return interest; } int main() { int principal = 10000; int rate = 5; int time = 3; int interest = calculateInterest(principal, rate, time); int totalAmount = principal + interest; return totalAmount; }\",\n\nIf the totalAmount equals the principal, can we infer that the rate was set to zero?",
  "Explanation": "The totalAmount equalling the principal could also be because the time was set to zero, resulting in zero interest. This does not necessarily imply that the rate must be zero; time being zero is a sufficient condition for no interest computation, regardless of the rate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
