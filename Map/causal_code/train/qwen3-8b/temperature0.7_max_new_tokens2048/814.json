  "Explanation": "An increase in totalVotes does not specify which candidate received the vote. It only indicates that a vote was cast, but without information on how votesPerCandidate's distribution changed, no conclusion can be drawn about any specific candidate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
