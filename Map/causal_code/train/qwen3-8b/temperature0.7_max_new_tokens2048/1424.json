  "Problem": "class AirConditioner { constructor(powerState, temperature) { this.isOn = powerState; this.temperature = temperature; }  setTemperature(newTemp) { if (this.isOn && newTemp >= 16 && newTemp <= 30) { this.temperature = newTemp; } } togglePower() { this.isOn = !this.isOn; if (!this.isOn) { this.temperature = null; } } }\",\n\nIf it is observed that the temperature setting is null, can we conclude the air conditioner is off?",
  "Explanation": "Whenever the air conditioner is turned off, by the method togglePower(), the temperature is set to null. This direct causal chain permits inferring that a null temperature setting means the air conditioner is off.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
