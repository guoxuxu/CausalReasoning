  "Explanation": "Even with a fixed discount, increasing the 'base_price' will ultimately increase the initial subtotal (base_price minus discount), which leads to a higher tax amount computed and thus increases the 'final_price'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
