  "Explanation": "Artificial rain sets the humidity to 100. With the temperature being 25 (greater than 20) and the new humidity at 100, the condition for 'Rainy' is met.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
