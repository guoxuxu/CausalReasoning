  "Explanation": "Given that rain occurs less frequently when it is not cloudy (10% chance) compared to when it is cloudy (30% chance), observing rain suggests a higher likelihood of cloudiness. This deduction is based on the direct observation of the effect (rain) and inferring the probable cause (cloudy) without intervening.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
