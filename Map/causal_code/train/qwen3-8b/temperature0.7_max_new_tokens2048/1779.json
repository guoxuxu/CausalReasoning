  "Problem": "ClimateControl class managing a climate system.\",\n\nDoes changing the indoor temperature imply a change in the outside weather?",
  "Explanation": "Internal temperature adjustments are influenced by user settings and possibly by the weather (particularly if it's 'cold'), but changing the temperature alone does not affect or indicate changes in the outside weather.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
