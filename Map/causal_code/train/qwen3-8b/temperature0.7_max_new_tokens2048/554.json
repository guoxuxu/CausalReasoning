  "Problem": "def compute_health_scores(age, weight, exercise_hours):\n    health_risk = (age * 0.2 + weight * 0.5) - exercise_hours * 2\n    if health_risk > 50:\n        return 'High Risk'\n    elif 20 <= health_risk <= 50:\n        return 'Medium Risk'\n    else:\n        return 'Low Risk'\",\n\nIf a person is categorized as 'High Risk', does it imply that they have either a high age or weight without knowing exercise hours?",
  "Explanation": "A 'High Risk' category generally indicates a high computed health risk score, which, without the modifying effect of exercise being specified, suggests that either age, weight, or both are significantly contributing to the increased score.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
