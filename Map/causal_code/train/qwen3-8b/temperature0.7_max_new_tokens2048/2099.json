  "Explanation": "Since 'updateWeather' was called with 'newTemp' as 75 and raining as true, 'isWeatherBad()' returning false must be influenced by this recent update. These arguments set up a condition where despite the rain, the temperature is sufficiently high not to be considered bad weather. Hence, we cannot infer the initial weather conditions from this output alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
