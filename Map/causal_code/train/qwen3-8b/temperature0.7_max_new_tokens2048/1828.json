  "Problem": "def process_data(data, factor, method):\n    if method == 'normalize':\n        max_value = max(data)\n        normalized = [x / max_value * factor for x in data]\n        return normalized\n    elif method == 'standardize':\n        mean = sum(data) / len(data)\n        std_dev = (sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)) ** 0.5\n        standardized = [(x - mean) / std_dev * factor for x in data]\n        return standardized\n    else:\n        return data\",\n\n If the spread of the output dataset is very large, can we infer that the 'method' used was 'standardize' with a high factor?",
  "Explanation": "Although using a high factor in the 'standardize' method can lead to a larger spread, a large output spread could also result from large variability in the original data itself or other manipulation not specified in 'process_data'. Thus, we cannot definitively infer that only the 'method' and 'factor' were responsible without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
