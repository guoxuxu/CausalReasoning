  "Problem": "var x = 10; var y = 2 * x + 5; var z = y - 4; var w = z + y;\",\n\nIf we directly set w to 100, is x necessarily 100?",
  "Explanation": "Directly setting w to 100 does not imply that x must be 100. w is a derivative of y and z, which are influenced by x, but w's value can be reached by various combinations of y and z values. Thus, directly setting w does not provide deterministic information about x's value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
