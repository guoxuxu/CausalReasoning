  "Explanation": "Artificially setting humidity to 80 and updating weather conditions via the 'update_weather' method will make the weather 'Rainy' if the temperature is above 20, as per the condition defined in the method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
