  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 5 degrees ensures that the conditions for rain or snow are not affected directly by the temperature alone (as it doesn't meet the higher temperature threshold for random rain). With colder and potentially dry conditions, the plant growth probability diminishes as both needed conditions (temperature >= 10 and rain) are less likely to be met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
