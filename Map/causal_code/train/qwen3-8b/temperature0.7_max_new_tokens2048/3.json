  "Explanation": "Manually setting 'is_top_student' to True for all students results in all students receiving double the 'bonus_points' (due to the multiplicative factor of 2 in the score update operation specifically for top students). This intervention directly causes an increase in the scores of all students.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
