  "Explanation": "While high pollution can lead to a reduction in John's energy, his energy could also reduce for reasons unrelated to the environment such as other health issues or natural fatigue unrelated to pollution. The presence of poor weather and specific pollution levels need to be verified as causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
