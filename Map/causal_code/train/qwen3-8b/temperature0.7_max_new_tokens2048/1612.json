  "Problem": "def manage_inventory(item, sales): \n    if item.stock < 10: \n        item.reorder(30) \n    item.stock -= sales \n    if sales > 20: \n        item.create_discount(5) \n    return item.stock\",\n\nIf high sales numbers are reported, did the item likely have a discount applied previously within the manage_inventory function?",
  "Explanation": "The creation of a discount is triggered after checking sales numbers greater than 20 within the same manage_inventory invocation. Therefore, sales above 20 lead to the creation of a discount, not the other way around.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
