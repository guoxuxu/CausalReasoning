  "Explanation": "The code checks if the 'temperature' key exists in the data dictionary. If it does not exist, the max_temp is set to None. This flow shows the direct impact of the missing 'temperature' data on the result of max_temp, without any external intervention altering the input or the flow of computation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
