  "Problem": "def weather_effect(day):\n  if day == 'sunny':\n    mood = 'happy'\n    productivity = 'high'\n  elif day == 'rainy':\n    mood = 'sad'\n    productivity = 'low'\n  else:\n    mood = 'neutral'\n    productivity = 'medium'\n  return mood, productivity\n\nweather = 'sunny'\nmood, productivity = weather_effect(weather)\",\n\nIf we artificially modify the mood to 'happy', will the productivity change to 'high'?",
  "Explanation": "The function 'weather_effect' determines productivity based purely on the weather condition, independent of the mood variable. Therefore, even if an intervention alters the mood to 'happy', it does not affect the productivity according to the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
