  "Explanation": "Setting happiness directly to 30 bypasses all conditions influenced by wealth changes. Since the check for 'party' or 'home' is purely based on happiness being greater than 25, fixing happiness at 30 ensures that the outcome is always 'party', irrespective of wealth.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
