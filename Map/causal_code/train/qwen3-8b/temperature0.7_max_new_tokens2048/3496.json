  "Problem": "class RoomController {\n  int temperature = 20;\n  boolean heaterOn = false;\n\n  public void increaseTemp() {\n    heaterOn = true;\n    temperature += 5;\n  }\n\n  public void decreaseTemp() {\n    if (heaterOn) {\n      heaterOn = false;\n    }\n    temperature -= 3;\n  }\n\n  public String checkStatus() {\n    if (heaterOn) {\n      return \"Heater is on and temperature is \" + temperature;\n    } else {\n      return \"Heater is off and temperature is \" + temperature;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf we intentionally turn off the heater and then call decreaseTemp(), will the temperature be exactly 17?",
  "Explanation": "With the initial temperature at 20 and the heater turned off manually before calling decreaseTemp(), this method will reduce the temperature by exactly 3, leading to a temperature of 17. This scenario represents from cause to effect with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
