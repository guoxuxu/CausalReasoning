  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'sales' in data: \n        data['revenue'] = data['sales'] * data['price'] \n    if data['revenue'] > 1000: \n        data['category'] = 'High' \n    else: \n        data['category'] = 'Low' \n    return data\",\n\nIf you could set the 'price' at a higher value, would it be easier to achieve a 'category' of 'High'?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'price' directly increases 'revenue' if 'sales' are constant ('revenue' = 'sales' * 'price'). Consequently, a higher 'price' would make it easier to surpass the 1000 revenue threshold, thus switching the 'category' to 'High'. This intervention on the 'price' facilitates achieving a high category through its direct impact on revenue.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
