  "Problem": "def process_data(data, scale_factor=1.5):\n    if data['value'] > 100:\n        data['category'] = 'High'\n    else:\n        data['category'] = 'Low'\n    data['adjusted_value'] = data['value'] * scale_factor\n    return data['category'], data['adjusted_value']\",\n\nAssuming the 'adjusted_value' resulted to be 300, can we infer the 'scale_factor' used, knowing that the initial 'value' was 100?",
  "Explanation": "Given the 'adjusted_value' formula as `value * scale_factor`, and knowing 'value' was 100, an 'adjusted_value' of 300 directly implies that the 'scale_factor' used had to be 3. This deduction is a straightforward calculation invoking the effect (adjusted_value = 300) to backtrack to the cause (scale_factor).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
