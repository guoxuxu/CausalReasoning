  "Explanation": "Given the logic in the 'exercise' method, any exercise duration greater than 60 minutes results in an automatic 10-point increase in health. Setting the exercise intentionally to 120 minutes bypasses the lower 5-point gain associated with shorter exercises.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
