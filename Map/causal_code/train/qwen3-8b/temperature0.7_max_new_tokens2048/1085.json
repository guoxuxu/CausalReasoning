  "Explanation": "Since skiing is chosen when the temperature is 75 degrees or less, which primarily occurs in 'winter' where temperatures range from 30 to 50, it is more likely that the season was 'winter' if the activity is skiing.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
