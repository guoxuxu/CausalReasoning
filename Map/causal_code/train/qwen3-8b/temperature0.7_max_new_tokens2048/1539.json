  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, coupon_code):\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == 'SAVE20':\n        discount = 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == 'OFF10':\n        discount = 0.1\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the price of an item is increased from $100 to $200 with coupon code 'SAVE20', will the final price also be doubled?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'SAVE20' provides a 20% discount, the final price will not be doubled. It will be $160 after discount when the price is $200, which is not twice the final price of $80 when the price is $100.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
