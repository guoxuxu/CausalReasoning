  "Explanation": "The causal pathway here is manipulated by setting the food to 'cookies'. Since cookies can result from any weather condition given the right intervention at the activity level, the weather can be represented as any state regardless of the food choice. Therefore, even with cookies as the food, you can't deduce as to what the weather was without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
