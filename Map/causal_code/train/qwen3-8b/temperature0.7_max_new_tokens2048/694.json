  "Problem": "class Employee { constructor(name, performanceRating, salary) { this.name = name; this.performanceRating = performanceRating; this.salary = salary; } updateSalary(percentIncrease) { this.salary += this.salary * percentIncrease / 100; } } const john = new Employee('John Doe', 85, 50000); function reviewPerformance(employee) { let newRating; if (employee.performanceRating > 80) { newRating = employee.performanceRating + 5; employee.updateSalary(10); } else { newRating = employee.performanceRating + 2; } employee.performanceRating = Math.min(newRating, 100); } reviewPerformance(john);\",\n\nIf we manually adjust John's salary upwards, does his performance rating automatically increase?",
  "Explanation": "Adjusting John's salary manually (via an external intervention like `john.salary += 5000`) does not affect his performance rating in the code. The `updateSalary` function does not influence performance ratings; it purely changes the salary field.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
