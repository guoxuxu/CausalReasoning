  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, demand, tax_rate):\n    tax = price * demand * tax_rate\n    final_sales = price * demand + tax\n    return final_sales\",\n\nCan decreasing the final_sales indicate that the tax_rate was increased if price and demand are known to be constant?",
  "Explanation": "With an intervention keeping price and demand constant, the only factor that can affect final_sales, as per the code, is tax_rate. An increase in tax_rate will increase the tax calculated, which should typically increase final_sales unless it leads to a drawback in demand which is fixed in this scenario. Thus, a decrease in final_sales can only be contradictory unless there's an error in execution or input, given the relationship established in the code. Hence, under normal circumstances and correct implementation, the answer would typically be 'No' but given the data flow in the code logic, it contradicts expectations.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
