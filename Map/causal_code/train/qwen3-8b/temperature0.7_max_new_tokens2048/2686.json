  "Problem": "def update_scores(scores, bonus, penalty, is_winner):\n    if is_winner:\n        new_scores = [score + bonus for score in scores]\n    else:\n        new_scores = [score - penalty if score > penalty else 0 for score in scores]\n    return new_scores\",\n\nIf 'bonus' is increased, will 'new_scores' increase for winners without changing any other variable?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'new_scores' is directly calculated by adding the 'bonus' to each element in 'scores' if 'is_winner' is True. Therefore, increasing 'bonus' increases each element of 'new_scores' for winners, assuming 'is_winner' remains True.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
