  "Explanation": "Setting weather_condition directly (if it were allowed, which the provided code does not support) to 'Tropical' does not inherently change temperature or humidity. Moreover, since weather_condition is the result of conditions involving both temperature and humidity, just observing 'Tropical' doesn’t guarantee both were set previously above specific thresholds without knowing prior values or further context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
