  "Explanation": "A decrease in the result could be due to several factors: higher filter_threshold, lower values in the data, or fewer data points available. You cannot definitively conclude that the filter_threshold was increased just based purely on the result changing unless other variables (like the input data) are held constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
