  "Explanation": "A higher than expected 'final_price' could be influenced by the absence of a coupon, but it could also result due to the 'customer_type' being 'regular' instead of 'premium', or other factors not introduced in the code. Thus, only knowing the price is higher does not conclusively dictate that 'has_coupon' was set to false due to an intervention without further context.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
