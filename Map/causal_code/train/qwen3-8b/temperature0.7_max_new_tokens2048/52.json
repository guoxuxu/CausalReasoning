  "Explanation": "If the temperature is manually set below 30, then, regardless of humidity, the heat index cannot be 'High'. Observing a 'Normal' heat index status after this manual setting strongly suggests that recent conditions (or interventions) ensured the temperature did not increase beyond the threshold, demonstrating causal inference through intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
