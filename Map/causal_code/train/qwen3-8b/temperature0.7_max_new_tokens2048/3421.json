  "Problem": "def compute_leaves_health(season, rain_inches, use_fertilizer):\n    if season == 'spring':\n        health = 70\n    elif season == 'summer':\n        health = 50\n    else:\n        health = 30\n    health += rain_inches * 2\n    if use_fertilizer:\n        health += 20\n    return health\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in leaf health after a fertilizer intervention, can we assume that the season influenced this increase?",
  "Explanation": "When fertilizer is used, an additional 20 points are added to leaf health regardless of the season. Even though the season also affects health, observing an increase after using the fertilizer does not allow us to conclusively determine the season’s contribution due to confounding influence of the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
