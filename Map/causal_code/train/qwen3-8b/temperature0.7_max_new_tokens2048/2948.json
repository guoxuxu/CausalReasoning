  "Explanation": "Changing the humidity to 50 directly intervenes in the conditions set by adjust_humidity, which states that weather_condition becomes 'rainy' only when humidity is above 70. Setting it below this threshold will change the condition away from 'rainy'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
