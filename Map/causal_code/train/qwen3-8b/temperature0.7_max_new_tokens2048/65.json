  "Explanation": "Directly from the code, the pressure is calculated based on the temperature (`this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.2)` initially, and `this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.1)` after intervention). In both cases, an increase in temperature directly causes an increase in pressure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
