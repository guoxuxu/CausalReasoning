  "Problem": "def compute_values(x, y):\n    z = x * y\n    u = z + y\n    if x > 0:\n        v = x + 2\n    else:\n        v = x - 2\n    result = u * v\n    return result\",\n\nIf the result decreases, does it imply that x must have decreased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in the result can occur due to changes in either x, y, or both. Decreasing y or having x switch signs (positive to negative, making v decrease more sharply via the else block) can also decrease the result. Therefore, a decrease in the result does not solely imply a decrease in x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
