  "Explanation": "A low health index could be caused by either being older than 50, having a diet quality below 3, or low exercise frequency. Without additional information on diet and exercise, one cannot definitively conclude that the person is over 50 based purely on a low health index.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
