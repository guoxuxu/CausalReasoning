  "Explanation": "Observing 'warm' only informs us that the temperature was above 20 at the time of forecasting. However, an intervention changing sensor readings afterwards does not confirm whether the earlier 'warm' reading was due to invoking 'decrease_temperature'. The 'warm' reading could originally have been due to either a high initial setting or use of 'increase_temperature'. The intervention obscures the direct causality.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
