  "Explanation": "The number of rabbits decreases as a natural consequence of greater predation by an increased number of foxes. This is deduced from the formula in the 'day_passes' method, where the number of rabbits is reduced based on the current number of foxes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
