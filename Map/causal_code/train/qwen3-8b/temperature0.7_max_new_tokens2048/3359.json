  "Explanation": "In the `assess_risk` method, a 'high' risk classification is directly assigned when BMI is greater than 30. Therefore, knowing that the risk level is 'high' implies that the BMI must be above 30, based on how the code is structured.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
