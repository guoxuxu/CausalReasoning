  "Explanation": "The method calculate_cloud_cover() sets the cloud cover to 'high' when the temperature is below 20 and the humidity is over 50. Therefore, with a low temperature and high humidity, the cloud cover would likely be high.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
