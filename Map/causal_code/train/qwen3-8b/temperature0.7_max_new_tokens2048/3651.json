  "Explanation": "The 'risk_level' is set to 'high' only when 'humidity' is greater than 50. Although 'risk_level' being 'high' strongly indicates that 'humidity' was above 50, without additional data or conditions confirming that no other factors influenced humidity, certainty can't be absolute. However, within the provided code, this is a valid inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
