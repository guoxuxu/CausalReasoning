  "Explanation": "The frequent activation of discounts (discountActive being true) could result from a series of higher purchase amounts that naturally exceed the current discountThreshold, rather than a direct impact of setting the threshold to a lower value. Without additional information, one cannot definitively conclude that the threshold value was altered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
