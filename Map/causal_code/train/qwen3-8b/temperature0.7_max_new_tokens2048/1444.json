  "Explanation": "The discounted price being less than 100 does not necessarily imply that the base price was not updated. The base price increase could still have occurred, but the random increase and the percentage discount combined could result in a final price less than 100. Therefore, the relationship between the final discounted price being less than 100 and the absence of a base price update does not hold as a deterministic causation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
