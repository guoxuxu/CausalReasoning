  "Explanation": "The observed traffic level of 70 could result from clear weather (range 50-80) or rainy weather (range 100-150, modified by adjusting other factors). Therefore, it’s impossible to precisely determine the weather status solely based on the traffic level.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
