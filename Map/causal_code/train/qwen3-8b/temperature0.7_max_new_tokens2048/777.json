  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'error' in data: \n        data['status'] = 'fail' \n        data['logged'] = True \n        log_error(data['error']) \n    else: \n        data['status'] = 'success' \n        if data['amount'] > 1000: \n            data['discount'] = 0.1 \n        else: \n            data['discount'] = 0.05 \n    return data\",\n\nDoes setting the 'status' field to 'success' mean there was no error in the data?",
  "Explanation": "When 'status' is set to 'success', it implies that the 'error' key was not found in the data, as delineated in the conditional if-else structure. Therefore, the code flow suggests that if the 'status' is 'success', there was no error. This tests the reasoning from effect to cause without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
