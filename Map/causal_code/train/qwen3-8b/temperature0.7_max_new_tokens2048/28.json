  "Explanation": "Given the current setup before the policy change, if a user's coffee access is revoked, it is a direct indication that their active project is no longer one of the projects ('Project X' or 'Project Z') previously permitting coffee access. An intervention that modifies this project assignment is the probable cause of this effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
