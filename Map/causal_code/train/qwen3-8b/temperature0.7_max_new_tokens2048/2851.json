  "Explanation": "While 'marketing_impact' increases 'daily_sales' by a fixed amount, 'daily_sales' can also be high due to the random seasonal variation, and 'base_sales'. Therefore, a high sales figure alone doesn't necessarily mean that a marketing impact was present.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
