  "Explanation": "Increasing 'filter_threshold' filters out more lower value data, reducing the data size. Enabling 'apply_correction' means the remaining high values get reduced (multiplied by 0.9), potentially dropping additional values below the new 'filter_threshold'. Hence, both actions together can further reduce the size of 'filtered_data' compared to just increasing the 'filter_threshold'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
