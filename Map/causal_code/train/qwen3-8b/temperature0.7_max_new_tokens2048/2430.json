  "Explanation": "Forced refunds, especially of high-priced items, could inflate the balance significantly beyond typical levels resulting from user-driven transactions and behavior, giving a misleading representation of average balance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
