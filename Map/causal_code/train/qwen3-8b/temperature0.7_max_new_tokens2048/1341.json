  "Explanation": "Setting the `ac_on` to True actuates the air conditioning system and leads to a reduction in `temperature`. This intervention bypasses the natural control flow where the AC is conditioned by `external_temp` values, proving a direct causal mechanism where actuating the AC impacts the `temperature`.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
