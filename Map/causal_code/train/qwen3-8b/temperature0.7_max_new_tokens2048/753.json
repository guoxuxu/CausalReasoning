  "Explanation": "An increase in final_sales could result from an increase in either price, demand, or marketing_spend. An increase in price or demand, each individually or both, would increase sales independent of marketing_spend.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
