  "Explanation": "Directly modifying the 'funds' attribute does not trigger the 'adjust_risk_profile' method. That method is only called automatically within the 'add_funds' method. Manual direct changes to 'funds' require an explicit call to 'adjust_risk_profile' or another method that triggers it.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
