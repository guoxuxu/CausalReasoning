  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulation { private int humidity; private int temperature; public WeatherSimulation(int initialHumidity, int initialTemperature) { this.humidity = initialHumidity; this.temperature = initialTemperature; } public void increaseHumidity(int increment) { this.humidity += increment; if (this.humidity > 90) { this.temperature += 2; } } public int getHumidity() { return humidity; } public int getTemperature() { return temperature; } public void heatUp(int increment) { this.temperature += increment; if (this.temperature > 30) { this.humidity += 5; } } }\",\n\nIf the humidity increases, was the temperature increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in humidity does not directly imply that the temperature was recently increased. While high humidity results in a temperature rise when humidity exceeds 90 in the 'increaseHumidity' method, the humidity itself can be increased through other means such as directly calling 'increaseHumidity'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
