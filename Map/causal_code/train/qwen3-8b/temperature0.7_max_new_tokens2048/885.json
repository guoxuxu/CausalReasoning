  "Explanation": "A decrease in the final price could be due either to a decrease in the original price or an increase in the discount rate. Without additional information, one cannot determine if the original price has been decreased.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
