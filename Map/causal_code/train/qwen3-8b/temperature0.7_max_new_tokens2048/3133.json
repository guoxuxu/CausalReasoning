  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    temperature = data.get('temp', 0) \n    humidity = data.get('humidity', 0) \n    adjusted_temp = temperature * 1.8 + 32 \n    comfort_index = adjusted_temp - 0.55 * (1 - humidity / 100) * (adjusted_temp - 58) \n    is_comfortable = comfort_index > 65 and humidity < 80 \n    return is_comfortable\",\n\nIf an intervention modifies the 'is_comfortable' flag from false to true, does it necessarily imply that temperature or humidity was adjusted?",
  "Explanation": "The 'is_comfortable' condition depends directly on the 'comfort_index' value and the humidity level. Modifying this flag to true from false implies an adjustment either in the temperature to influence the 'comfort_index' or in the humidity to meet the requirement of being less than 80%, as those are the direct factors in the logical condition stated in the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
