  "Explanation": "A low stock of 'apple' can be due to reasons other than higher sales, such as initial lower stock or inaccuracies in inventory records. Without additional information, we can't confirm the cause as higher sales directly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
