  "Explanation": "Reducing the number of foxes will decrease rabbit predation, leading to a potential increase in the rabbit population due to lower mortality rates, as per the formula in the 'day_passes' method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
