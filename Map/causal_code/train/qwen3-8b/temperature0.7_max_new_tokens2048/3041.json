  "Explanation": "Changing someone’s risk category from 'High Risk' to 'Low Risk' may not necessarily mean that they no longer have a chronic disease, as the risk category can also be influenced by factors such as age and the amount of physical activity. An increase in physical activity hours or becoming younger than 50 could also lead to a reduced risk.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
