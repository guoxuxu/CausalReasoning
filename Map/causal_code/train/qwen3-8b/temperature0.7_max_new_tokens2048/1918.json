  "Explanation": "While the patient count does increase further during flu season, an increase in patient count alone does not necessarily mean it is the flu season. There could be other reasons for an increase in patient count, such as general admissions not related to the flu.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
