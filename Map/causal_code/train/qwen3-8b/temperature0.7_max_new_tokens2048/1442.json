  "Explanation": "While calling 'water_plants' and 'sunbathe_plants' can lead to all plants being healthy by satisfying their needs, it is not the only way to achieve this state. Healthy plants can also result from individually setting their needs directly outside the methods, or they could have already been initialized with appropriate needs.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
