  "Explanation": "Resetting the 'status' to 'young' by intervention does not affect the 'age' attribute in the data since status assignment is unidirectional—from 'age' to 'status' in the code and does not establish a mechanism to reverse-infer or modify 'age' based on 'status'. Thus, this intervention on effect does not causally influence the cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
