  "Explanation": "In the given code, the only condition where the air conditioner is set to True is when the temperature exceeds 25 degrees. Therefore, if the air conditioner is on, it implies that the temperature must have indeed been higher than 25 degrees at some point.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
