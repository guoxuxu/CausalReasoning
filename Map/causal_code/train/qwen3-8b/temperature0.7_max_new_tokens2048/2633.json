  "Explanation": "Setting the discount percentage to 0 by intervention breaks the natural link between loyalty points and discount eligibility. Normally, fewer than 100 loyalty points would result in no discount, but because this was forced through intervention, one cannot determine the loyalty points from the discount_percentage.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
