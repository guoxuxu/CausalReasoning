  "Explanation": "Manipulating the input 'data' in such a way that all values are high will directly increase the overall sum of the list, while maintaining a steady count. This manipulation results in a higher average. This is due to the direct dependency of the 'average' calculation on the sum of the list and its length in the 'analyse_data' function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
