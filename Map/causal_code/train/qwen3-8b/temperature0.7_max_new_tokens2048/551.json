  "Problem": "def increment(x): return x + 1\ndef double(x): return x * 2\ndef process_data(x): y = increment(x); z = double(y); return z\",\n\nIf you could control and set the output of `increment` function to a fixed value, would the final output `z` of `process_data` still depend on `x`?",
  "Explanation": "When intervening and setting the output of `increment` to a fixed value `y`, the variable `x` no longer influences `y`. The output `z` of `process_data` exclusively depends on the modified value of `y` since it is directly passed to `double` which then calculates `z` as `2*y`. The original value of `x` is irrelevant in this scenario due to the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
