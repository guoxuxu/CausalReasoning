  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag): \n    if flag == 'filter': \n        filtered_data = [x for x in data if x > 0] \n        return sum(filtered_data) \n    elif flag == 'no_filter': \n        return sum(data) * 0.5\",\n\nIf we know the summation process was adjusted by a factor, can we infer the flag was set to 'no_filter'?",
  "Explanation": "If a factor (like multiplication by 0.5) has adjusted the sum, we can safely infer that 'no_filter' was used, because that's the only case in the provided function where the sum is manipulated by multiplication after calculating the sum of data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
