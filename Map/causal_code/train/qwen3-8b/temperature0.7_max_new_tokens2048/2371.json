  "Explanation": "The decrease in heart rate occurs only if the daily steps exceed 10000. If the steps are increased but remain below this threshold, the heart rate actually increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
