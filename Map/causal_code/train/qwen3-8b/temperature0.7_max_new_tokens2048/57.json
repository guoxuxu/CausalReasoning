  "Problem": "class WeatherSystem { constructor() { this.temperature = 20; this.humidity = 50; } increaseHeat(units) { this.temperature += units; if (this.temperature > 25) { this.humidity += 5; } } decreaseHumidity(percent) { this.humidity -= this.humidity * (percent / 100); if (this.humidity < 45) { this.temperature -= 3; } } }\",\n\nIf the temperature increases significantly, will the humidity likely increase without any other changes?",
  "Explanation": "The method increaseHeat in WeatherSystem increases temperature and raises humidity if the temperature exceeds 25 degrees. Therefore, increasing temperature significantly can lead to increased humidity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
