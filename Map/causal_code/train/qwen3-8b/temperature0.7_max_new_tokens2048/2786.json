  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'temperature' in data:\n        temp_adjust = data['temperature'] * 1.8 + 32\n    else:\n        temp_adjust = 0\n    result = temp_adjust + 10\n    if data.get('pressure', 100) > 120:\n        result += 5\n    return result\",\n\nIf the 'temperature' key is present in the input data dictionary, will the final 'result' always be influenced?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of the 'temperature' key triggers the conversion of temperature to Fahrenheit, which directly influences the 'temp_adjust' calculation. This value is then added to 10 to compute the 'result', thus influencing it directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
