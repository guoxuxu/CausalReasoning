  "Explanation": "After the intervention where isOpen is forcibly set to true without considering stock levels, calling 'receiveShipment' will still change the stock but it will not affect the open status of the warehouse, as it is already open irrespective of the stock level.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
