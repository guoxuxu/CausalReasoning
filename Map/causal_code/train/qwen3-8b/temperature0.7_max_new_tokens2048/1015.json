  "Explanation": "Zeroing out the sales reports does not affect inventory levels. Inventory and sales are tracked separately in the system; modifying one does not inherently affect the other. This action would be an intervention in the reporting mechanism that does not change the physical inventory state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
