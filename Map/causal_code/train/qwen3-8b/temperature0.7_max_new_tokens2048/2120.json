  "Explanation": "Since 'corrected' is set to False solely under the condition where 'status' contains 'error', this attribute being False implies that 'error' was indeed in the 'status'. The code does not provide any other path to set 'corrected' to False, thereby establishing a strong link from effect back to its cause without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
