  "Explanation": "Intervening to set the weather as sunny directly leads to the decision of not carrying an umbrella based on the logic defined in `decide_to_carry_umbrella`, where umbrellas are not taken when it's sunny.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
