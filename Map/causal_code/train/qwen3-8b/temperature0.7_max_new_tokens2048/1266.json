  "Explanation": "Setting the tax_rate to zero means that the tax component of the final_price calculation will be zero. Thus, any increase in base_price directly translates to an increase in final_price, unmitigated by taxes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
