  "Explanation": "Given the structure of the 'decide_activity' function, 'watching TV' is exclusively the output when the input weather is 'rainy'. Thus, observing the activity 'watching TV' informs us with certainty about the prior state, which is rainy weather.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
