  "Explanation": "Although lowering the VAT rate is one way to reduce the final price including VAT, it's possible that the reduction could also result from other factors such as increased product discounts or changes in the base price. Without further details on these variables, a reduction in overall price cannot solely be attributed to a reduced VAT rate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
