  "Explanation": "When the heart rate is updated to a value greater than 100 using `update_heart_rate()`, the `alert()` function is immediately called with the argument 'high_heart_rate', which results in printing the alert message.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
