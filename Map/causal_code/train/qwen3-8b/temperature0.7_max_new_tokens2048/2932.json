  "Problem": "def compute_values(x, increment_by=1):\n  A = x * 2\n  B = A + increment_by\n  if B > 20:\n    C = B * 2\n  else:\n    C = B + 10\n  D = C - A\n  return D\",\n\nIf we set the 'increment_by' parameter to a higher value, will 'D' necessarily be higher?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'increment_by' increases 'B', which could increase 'C' if 'B' stays below or just crosses over 20. However, because 'D' equals 'C' minus 'A', and 'A' is independent from 'increment_by', the relative increase in 'C' may not proportionally affect 'D' depending on the arithmetic operations and conditions involving the crossing over the threshold of 20. Therefore, solely increasing 'increment_by' doesn’t guarantee a higher 'D'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
