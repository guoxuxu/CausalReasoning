  "Explanation": "According to the logic in 'analyze', the category 'Youth' is assigned only if the mean age is below 30. Therefore, seeing 'Youth' as the result allows us to infer that the mean age was below 30.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
