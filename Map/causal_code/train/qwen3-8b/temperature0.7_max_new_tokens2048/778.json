  "Explanation": "The code specifies that if the 'amount' exceeds 1000, 'discount' should be set to 0.1. By intervening and setting 'amount' to 1200, this condition is fulfilled, hence the 'discount' will indeed be 0.1. This checks the understanding from cause (amount being set) to effect (discount rate) with an intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
