  "Explanation": "Yes, given the setup and behavior of the provided methods, if an intervention was executed (as per the 'causeRain' method), and it resulted in a rainy observation, it manifests that the intervention successfully set 'sunny' to false.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
