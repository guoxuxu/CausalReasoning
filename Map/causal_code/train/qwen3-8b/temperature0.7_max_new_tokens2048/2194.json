  "Problem": "{\n    \"code\": \"class Initializer { int counter; Initializer() { counter = 0; } void increment() { counter += 1; } boolean isEven() { return counter % 2 == 0; } } Initializer init = new Initializer(); init.increment(); boolean result = init.isEven();\"\n  },\n\nIf a developer patches the code so that `isEven()` directly returns false and it does so, can we conclude `increment()` was called an odd number of times?",
  "Explanation": "Direct patch in the `isEven()` method to always return false breaks the original causal relationship between the number of times `increment()` is called and the output of `isEven()`. Hence, no specific conclusion about the number of calls to `increment()` can be derived from `isEven()` returning false in this modified scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
