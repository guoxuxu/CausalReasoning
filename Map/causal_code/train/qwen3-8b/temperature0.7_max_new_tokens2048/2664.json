  "Explanation": "The forceOutdoorEvent() method checks if the weather condition is rainy, and if so, sets the useUmbrellas flag to true. This is a straightforward intervention where changing the execution flow causes umbrellas to be used when forcing an outdoor event despite rainy conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
