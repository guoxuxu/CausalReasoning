  "Explanation": "In the provided code, if the diet attribute is set to 'bad', the `risk_factor` consistently increases by 1. The calculation does not depend on other attributes (like age or exercise) to increase the risk if the diet is 'bad'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
