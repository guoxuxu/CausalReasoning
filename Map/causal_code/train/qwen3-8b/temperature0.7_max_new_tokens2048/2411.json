  "Explanation": "The function 'process_data' scales 'data_input' and then adds or subtracts a constant based on its value. When 'data_input' increases, 'warmed_data' will increase since it includes a multiplication by data and a positive constant factor. Since the operation (data * 1.2 + data) scales positively with 'data', 'warmed_data' also increases. If 'data_input' is still under 20, the final result gets decreased by 10, but the rate of increase in 'warmed_data' due to the multiplication by a factor greater than 1 ensures that the overall 'result' increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
