  "Explanation": "The function compute_interest calculates the final interest based on the initial balance and a fixed interest rate for a given number of years without intervention. If the initial balance is higher, the function computes a proportionally higher interest for each year, resulting in a higher accumulated final interest.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
