  "Problem": "class TrafficSystem {\n  int signal; \n  boolean isRaining; \n\n  public TrafficSystem(boolean weather) {\n    isRaining = weather;\n    if (isRaining) {\n      signal = 1; // 1 for red\n    } else {\n      signal = 0; // 0 for green\n    }\n  }\n\n  public void manualOverride(int newSignal) {\n    signal = newSignal;\n  }\n\n  public int getTrafficStatus() {\n    if (signal == 1) {\n      return 5; // Heavy traffic\n    } else {\n      return 1; // Light traffic\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf it starts raining, will the traffic status reflect heavy traffic?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, when it is raining (isRaining is true), the traffic signal is set to red (signal = 1). According to the getTrafficStatus method, a red signal (signal = 1) corresponds to heavy traffic (returns 5).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
