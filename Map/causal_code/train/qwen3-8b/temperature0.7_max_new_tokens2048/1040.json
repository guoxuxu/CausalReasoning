  "Explanation": "The initial temperature alone does not determine reaching the 'danger' status without knowing the specific increments used to increase the temperature. System status 'danger' is directly caused by the temperature exceeding 100 which is not solely dependent on the initial state but on the magnitude of the increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
