  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_value): \n  clean_data = [x for x in data if x > filter_value]\n  summary = sum(clean_data) / len(clean_data)\n  return summary\n\ndata_list = [5, 15, 20, 25, 30]\nfilter_threshold = 10\nresult = process_data(data_list, filter_threshold)\",\n\nIf the data_list contains higher values, will the function result be higher?",
  "Explanation": "The function process_data calculates the average of values greater than the filter_value. If data_list contains higher values, more values will potentially exceed the filter_value, hence the average (summary) is likely to be higher.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
