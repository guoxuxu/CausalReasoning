  "Problem": "def calculate_health_index(smoking, exercise_hours, diet_quality):\n    base_health = 100\n    if smoking:\n        base_health -= 30\n    base_health += (exercise_hours * 2)\n    if diet_quality == 'good':\n        base_health += 20\n    elif diet_quality == 'poor':\n        base_health -= 20\n    return base_health\",\n\nDoes a lower health index necessarily imply that the person smokes?",
  "Explanation": "A lower health index can result from multiple factors according to the code: smoking, less exercise hours, and poor diet quality. Thus, a decrease in health index alone (effect) cannot definitively imply that the person smokes (cause), as other factors might contribute to this effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
