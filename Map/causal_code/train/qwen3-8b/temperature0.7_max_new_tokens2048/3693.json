  "Explanation": "Preventing rain can be achieved by ensuring clouds do not form, since the presence of clouds is a prerequisite for rain. Therefore, interventions aimed at preventing rain, such as manipulating temperature or humidity to inhibit cloud formation, lead to a direct conclusion that clouds did not form.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
