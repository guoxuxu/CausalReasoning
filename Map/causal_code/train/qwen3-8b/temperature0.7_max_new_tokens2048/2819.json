  "Problem": "def compute_statistics(data): \n    mean_val = sum(data) / len(data) \n    data_squared = [x**2 for x in data] \n    mean_squares = sum(data_squared) / len(data) \n    variance = mean_squares - mean_val**2 \n    return mean_val, variance, data_squared\",\n\nIf `variance` is very low, can we infer that all elements in `data` are close to the `mean_val`?",
  "Explanation": "A low variance indicates that the squared differences from the mean (which contribute to the variance calculation) are small on average. This typically means that most of the data points are close to the mean value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
