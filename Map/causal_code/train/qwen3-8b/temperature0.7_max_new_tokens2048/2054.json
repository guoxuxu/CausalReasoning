  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'final_prices' could be due to a reduction in 'after_discount' values which can be caused by changes in either membership status, original prices, or coupon application mechanism. An increase in 'coupon_value' does not directly result in a general decrease of 'final_prices'; it could rather increase discounts on specific price items only if those items are above the coupon value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
