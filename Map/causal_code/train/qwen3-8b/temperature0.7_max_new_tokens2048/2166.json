  "Explanation": "Changing the weight of grades in the calculation formula influences the final score mathematically, but it does not change the actual grades received by students. It simply alters the impact of grades on the final result, without modifying the grades themselves.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
