  "Explanation": "The `adjust_humidity` function modifies the humidity by multiplying the new value by 0.9 if the temperature is above 20. Therefore, if humidity is less than expected after this method is called with the temperature over 20, it implies that the method functioned as designed by adjusting the humidity to 90% of the input value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
