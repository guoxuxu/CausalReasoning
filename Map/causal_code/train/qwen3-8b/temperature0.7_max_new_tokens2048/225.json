  "Explanation": "Initially, the plant receives suboptimal water (150 ml), insufficient for the optimal rate but enough to avoid 0 growth. Increasing the water to 250 ml satisfies the optimal water requirement, potentially increasing the growth rate by 1 point as other conditions remain within acceptable non-zero growth thresholds.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
