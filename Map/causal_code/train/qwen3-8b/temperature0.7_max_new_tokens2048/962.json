The net income depends on both the revenue and expenses.\",\n    \"code\": \"def calculate_net_income(revenue, expenses):\n    net_income = revenue - expenses\n    if net_income > 0:\n        print(f'Profit: ${net_income}')\n    else:\n        print(f'Loss: ${net_income}')\nrevenue = 1000\nexpenses = 500\ncalculate_net_income(revenue, expenses)\"\n  },\n\nIf we introduce a government subsidy into the revenue, will this affect the net income?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a subsidy to the revenue increases the total revenue. Since net income is calculated as revenue minus expenses, an increase in revenue (caused by the intervention of adding a subsidy) would lead to an increase in net income.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
