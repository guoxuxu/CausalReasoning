  "Explanation": "The absence of change in 'new_inventory' can occur because the increase in 'units_sold' was exactly equal to the increase in 'current_inventory', balancing out the effects even if 'units_added' is zero. Thus, not observing a change in the effect does not necessarily indicate the absence of the cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
