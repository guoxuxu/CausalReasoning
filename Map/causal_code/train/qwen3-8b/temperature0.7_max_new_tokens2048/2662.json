  "Explanation": "The checkWeather() method sets the outdoorEvent to true if weatherCondition is not rainy (assuming sunny as 1 which does not equal 2). Therefore, changing the condition to sunny directly causes the outdoor event to happen.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
