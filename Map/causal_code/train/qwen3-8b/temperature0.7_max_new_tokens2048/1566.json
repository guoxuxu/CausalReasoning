  "Explanation": "Adding only 10 units could either indicate a high threshold was set, preventing a major restock, or it could be a result of the restocking process that was determined independently of the threshold value (e.g., through a default operational decision or error).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
