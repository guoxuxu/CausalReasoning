  "Explanation": "While making all elements even would result in such an output, we cannot conclusively determine the nature of the intervention without knowing exactly what changes were made. It's possible that the manipulation could have been different, such as manually setting values to specific even numbers or other actions that didn't involve changing all elements to be even.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
