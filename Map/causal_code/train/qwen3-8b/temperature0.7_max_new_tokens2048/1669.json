  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  modified_data = data * 2\n  if modified_data > 100:\n    output = True\n  else:\n    output = False\n  return output\n\ndef trigger_action(condition):\n  if condition:\n    response = 'Action Triggered'\n  else:\n    response = 'No Action'\n  return response\",\n\nDoes changing the response in `trigger_action` from 'Action Triggered' to 'No Action' imply that the `process_data` function returned `False`?",
  "Explanation": "The `trigger_action` acts based on the condition passed to it. If the response is 'No Action', it indicates the condition evaluated to `False`. According to `process_data`, this suggests that prior to being processed, either the data was equal to or less than 50, resulting in 'modified_data' of 100 or less.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
