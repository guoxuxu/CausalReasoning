  "Problem": "def calculate_scores(temperature, adjustment): \n    if temperature > 20: \n        score = 70 \n        if adjustment: \n            score += 15 \n    else: \n        score = 50 \n        if adjustment: \n            score -= 10 \n    return score\",\n\nIf the score changed from 50 to 70, can it be inferred that the temperature rose above 20 without any additional information or intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The change in score from 50 to 70 suggests a shift from the else block to the if block of the temperature condition, which is set at the threshold of 20 degrees. No alternative code path suggests a way to achieve such a score increase without this temperature increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
