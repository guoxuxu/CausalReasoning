  "Problem": "Python code provided above\",\n\nIf we were to enact additional public policies, would the wildlife population likely increase?",
  "Explanation": "The method 'enact_policies' directly increases the wildlife population by 100 units when policies are enacted. Since the question implies intervening to enact further policies, this would likely cause an increase in the wildlife population.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Enact Public Policy → Habitat Preservation; Enact Public Policy → Pollution Reduction; Habitat Preservation → Wildlife Population Increase; Pollution Reduction → Environmental Quality; Environmental Quality → Wildlife Population Increase"
