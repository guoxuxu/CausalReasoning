  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data):\n  sales = sum(data['sales'])\n  expenses = sum(data['expenses'])\n  profit = sales - expenses\n  roi = (profit / expenses) * 100 if expenses != 0 else 0\n  return {'sales': sales, 'expenses': expenses, 'profit': profit, 'roi': roi}\n\ndata = {'sales': [100, 200, 300], 'expenses': [50, 150, 200]}\nmetrics = compute_metrics(data)\",\n\nIf the computed ROI is observed to decrease, could it imply an increase in expenses?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in ROI (Return on Investment), which is calculated as (profit / expenses) * 100, could happen due to lesser profit or greater expenses. Given no change in sales, an increase in expenses would reduce profit hence decreasing ROI, assuming profit did not change disproportionately. This shows tracing back from an effect (ROI change) to a potential cause (expenses change) without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
