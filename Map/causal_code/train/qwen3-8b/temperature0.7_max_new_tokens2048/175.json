  "Explanation": "Adding water increases the 'water_level' which can make it sufficient to meet or exceed the 'water_used'. After intervention by adding water, a subsequent 'make_coffee' attempt should find sufficient water and likely succeed, demonstrating causality with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
