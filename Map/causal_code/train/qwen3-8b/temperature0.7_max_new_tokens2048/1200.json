  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  if 'error' in data:\n    data['status'] = 'failed'\n  else:\n    data['status'] = 'success'\n    if data['user'] == 'admin':\n      data['access_level'] = 'full'\n    else:\n      data['access_level'] = 'limited'\n  return data\",\n\nIf the function is called with the input {'user': 'admin'}, will the status always be set to 'success'?",
  "Explanation": "The status being set to 'success' depends not only on the user being 'admin' but also on the absence of 'error' in the input data. If 'error' exists, the status will be set to 'failed', regardless of the user role.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
