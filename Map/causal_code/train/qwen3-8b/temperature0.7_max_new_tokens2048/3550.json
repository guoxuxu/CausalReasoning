  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    modified_data = data * 2\n    final_data = modified_data + 100\n    return final_data\n\ndata = 50\nresult = process_data(data)\nprint(result)\",\n\nIf the input 'data' is doubled, will the 'result' necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "The process_data function explicitly defines that the input 'data' is multiplied by 2 ('modified_data = data * 2') and then adds 100. Thus, increasing the input will proportionally increase the 'result'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
