  "Explanation": "The relationship that vehicle speed will increase when it's sunny does not uniquely apply since other unmodeled factors (such as another code that changes speed) could influence speed; observing a speed of 70 alone does not allow us to deterministically infer that the weather was sunny.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
