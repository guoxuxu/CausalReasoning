  "Explanation": "Increasing daily steps from below 5000 will likely change the recommendation from 'Increase walking' to 'Maintain' or 'Well done on active lifestyle', depending on how much the steps are increased, because the recommendation is directly dependent on the number of daily steps.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
