  "Explanation": "Setting 'discounted_price' does not have any causal effect on 'inventory'. These two variables operate independently in the given function, with 'inventory' influencing separate logic blocks (ordering logic) unrelated to pricing or discount calculations. Thus, altering 'discounted_price' provides no information about 'inventory' levels.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
