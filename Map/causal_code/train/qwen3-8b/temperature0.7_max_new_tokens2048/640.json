  "Explanation": "Setting 'result' to 'Low' via intervention does not reliably inform us about the value of 'a' since the relationship between 'a' and 'result' can be overridden by the intervention. For example, if 'b' or 'c' are directly modified by intervention, 'a' could be greater than or less than 10 irrespective of 'result' being 'Low'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
