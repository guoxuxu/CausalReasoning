  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n  if 'age' in data: \n    data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n  if data.get('is_adult'):\n    data['discount'] = 0.2\n  else:\n    data['discount'] = 0\n  if 'purchase_amount' in data:\n    data['final_amount'] = data['purchase_amount'] * (1 - data['discount'])\n  return data\",\n\nIf 'age' is removed from the data dictionary entirely, will 'final_amount' still be calculated?",
  "Explanation": "Removing 'age' from the data removes the ability to determine if the individual is an adult ('is_adult'). 'is_adult' affects the 'discount' which in turn influences 'final_amount'. Without knowing 'is_adult', 'discount' defaults to 0 but will affect how 'final_amount' is calculated if 'purchase_amount' is present.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
