  "Explanation": "Employing more doctors increases the system's capacity to treat patients. Since each doctor can treat up to five patients, increasing the number of doctors allows the health system to treat either the same number if patients were fewer or more if there were more patients waiting than were previously treatable.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
