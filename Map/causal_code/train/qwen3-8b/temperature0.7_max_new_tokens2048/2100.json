  "Explanation": "The function adjust_temperature() directly changes the temperature range based on the input season. If the season is set to 'summer', it returns a temperature uniformly distributed between 25 and 35 degrees.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
