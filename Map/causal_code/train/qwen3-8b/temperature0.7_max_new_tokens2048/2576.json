  "Explanation": "The decrease in rabbits could also be due to natural fluctuation of their birth rate (represented by '10 * random.random()'). There may not be a direct increase in foxes that prompted the decrease in rabbits.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
