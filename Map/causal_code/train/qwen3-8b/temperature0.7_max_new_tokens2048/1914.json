  "Explanation": "While 'Rainy' is predicted when humidity is above 80 according to the forecast method, a lower temperature (under 30) can also cause a 'Cloudy' forecast despite high humidity. Therefore, without knowing the temperature, one can't conclusively determine that high humidity was the cause from the 'Rainy' effect alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
