  "Problem": "provided above\",\n\nIf economic spending is observed to decrease, can we infer there was an increase in public health funding?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in economic spending could result from either a decrease in health issues or other factors affecting economic calculations, such as random fluctuations modeled in the code. Without specific knowledge about the health issues or other interventions, we cannot conclusively infer that public health funding was increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
