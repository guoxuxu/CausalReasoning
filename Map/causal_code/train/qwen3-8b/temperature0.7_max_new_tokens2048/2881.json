  "Problem": "def process_data(data_list):\n    processed_list = []\n    for data in data_list:\n        if data % 2 == 0:\n            processed_list.append(data * 10)\n        else:\n            processed_list.append(data + 10)\n    return processed_list\",\n\nIf all numbers in processed_list are multiples of 10, was the intervention of adding 5 to all original numbers implemented?",
  "Explanation": "If all numbers in processed_list are multiples of 10, this does not necessitate an intervention of adding 5 being applied beforehand. By the code's default logic when there are no odd inputs or adjustments, all even numbers are simply multiplied by 10 making them still multiples of 10. Additional intervention is not necessarily implied from this observation alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
