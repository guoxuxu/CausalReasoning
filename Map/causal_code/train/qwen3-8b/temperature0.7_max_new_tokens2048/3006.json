  "Explanation": "The `risk_factor` is directly calculated using the `age` column (multiplied by 0.2). Since `age` values are imputed and possibly altered in the `clean` function, any changes to `age` would directly influence the resulting `risk_factor` values calculated later in the analysis pipeline.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
