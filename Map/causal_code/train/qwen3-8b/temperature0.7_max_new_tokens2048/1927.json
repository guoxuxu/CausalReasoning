  "Explanation": "If the systemLoad is decreased by 20 units during debugMode, it effectively mitigates the extra load added by debugMode. Assuming the original systemLoad was near the boundary value (around 60), reducing it to 40 will move performance from low (2) to high (10) as per the calculation rules of the calculatePerformance function, showing an intervention-triggered shift from cause (systemLoad changes) to effect (system performance).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
