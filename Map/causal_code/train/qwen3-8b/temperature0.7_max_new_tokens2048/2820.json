  "Problem": "def compute_statistics(data): \n    mean_val = sum(data) / len(data) \n    data_squared = [x**2 for x in data] \n    mean_squares = sum(data_squared) / len(data) \n    variance = mean_squares - mean_val**2 \n    return mean_val, variance, data_squared\",\n\nWould setting all elements of `data` to the same value affect the `variance`?",
  "Explanation": "Setting all elements of `data` to the same value makes every term in `(x - mean_val)**2` zero, because each `x` equals `mean_val`. Therefore, `variance` would become zero since the differences from the mean are all zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
