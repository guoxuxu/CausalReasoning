  "Explanation": "A 'Sunny' status requires the temperature to be above 20 degrees and not raining (based on the `getWeatherStatus` function). Though `temperatureRise` can contribute to this status after crossing 30 degrees, it is not the only way for the weather to be 'Sunny'; it can also happen just by having a temperature above 20 degrees with no rain, regardless of reaching 30 degrees.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
