  "Problem": "class ShoppingCart { constructor() { this.items = []; this.total = 0; } addItem(item) { this.items.push(item); if (item.onSale) { this.total += item.price * 0.8; } else { this.total += item.price; } } removeItem(itemIndex) { const item = this.items[itemIndex]; if (item) { this.total -= item.onSale ? item.price * 0.8 : item.price; this.items.splice(itemIndex, 1); } } }\",\n\nIf the total increases when an item is added, does it imply that the added item's price was high?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in total just indicates that an item was added, but it does not necessarily mean the item's price was high. The item could also be on sale which affects the additional total differently due to the discount factor applied in addItem method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
