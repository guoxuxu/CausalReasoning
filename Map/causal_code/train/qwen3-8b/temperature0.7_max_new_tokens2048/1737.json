  "Explanation": "Setting unitPrice to zero would indeed drop the revenue to zero, but it does not affect the initial unitsSold, which is influenced by original product sales and updates, independent of pricing.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
