  "Explanation": "Given the intervention where rain is set to False (self.rainy remains or becomes False) and temperature is increased enough (70 + 20 = 90 degrees) by temp_change in the update_weather method, the condition for 'Go swimming' (>80 degrees) in decide_activity() will be satisfied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
