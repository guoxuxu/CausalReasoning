  "Explanation": "If 'discount' is applied (i.e., not 0), it indicates that 'is_adult' was set to True, which in turn could only be checked if 'age' was present in the data. However, the default discount (0) does not ensure the absence of 'age', as it might still mean the age present specifies a person who is not an adult.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
