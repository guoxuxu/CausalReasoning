  "Explanation": "The `final_price_with_discount` is determined based on the product price after applying a discount. An increase in the `final_price_with_discount` while keeping the discount percentage constant typically implies an increase in the original price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
