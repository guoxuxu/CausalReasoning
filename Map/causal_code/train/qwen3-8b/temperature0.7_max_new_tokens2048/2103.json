  "Explanation": "If the clothing changes from a 'coat' to 't-shirt', it suggests a significant increase in 'temperature', which typically suggests a seasonal change from a colder season like 'winter' to a warmer one like 'summer'. However, this might not always be the case due to overlapping temperature ranges in seasons like 'spring' and 'fall'. This reflects an intervention based inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
