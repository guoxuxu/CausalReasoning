  "Explanation": "Although an increase in pollution level can reduce the growth rate of the plant, a decrease in growth rate might also be influenced by other factors in the environment, such as changes in water or sunlight. Therefore, observation of a decrease in growth rate alone does not solely indicate that pollution levels have increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
