  "Problem": "def compute_health_risk(age, smoker, bmi): \n    risk = 0 \n    if age > 50: \n        risk += 20 \n    if smoker: \n        risk += 30 \n    if bmi > 25: \n       risk += 10 \n    return risk\",\n\nIf someone's age increases, will their health risk score necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "The code increments the risk score by 20 if age is greater than 50. Thus, for individuals crossing the threshold of 50 years, their risk score increases due to age, independent of other factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
