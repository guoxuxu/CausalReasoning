  "Explanation": "The inventory check result of 40 apples is directly due to the removal action where 10 apples were subtracted from the initial 50 apples. If no apples were removed, the inventory would show 50 apples instead.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
