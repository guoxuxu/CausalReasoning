  "Explanation": "The evaluate_health function decreases the health score by 30 if the person is a smoker. Stopping smoking would eliminate this penalty, leading to an increased score.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
