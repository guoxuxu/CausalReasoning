  "Explanation": "Lowering the VAT rate reduces the amount of tax added to the final price of the product. Assuming no other changes in the product's discount or base price, reducing the VAT rate will decrease the total cost to the consumer, inclusive of tax.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
