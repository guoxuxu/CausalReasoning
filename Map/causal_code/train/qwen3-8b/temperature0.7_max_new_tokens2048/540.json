  "Explanation": "While increasing fertilizer does contribute to growth rate, the increase doesn’t necessarily imply the plant is a 'Cactus'. Other species also react positively to increased fertilizer, and the differential growth rates due to species cannot be determined solely based on this intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
