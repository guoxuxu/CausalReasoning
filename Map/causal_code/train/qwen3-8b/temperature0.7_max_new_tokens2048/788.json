  "Problem": "Provided above\",\n\nIf the function 'add_item' is modified to include a logging feature that logs every item added, will the final total price change?",
  "Explanation": "The addition of a logging feature in the 'add_item' method records operations but does not affect the actual operations of adding items or their prices. Therefore, the computation of the total price remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
