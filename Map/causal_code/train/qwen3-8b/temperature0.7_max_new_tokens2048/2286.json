  "Explanation": "If the reduction in the number of hospitals is due to an intervention that manually adjusts the hospital count, and not through actual patient admissions, we cannot directly infer that more critical patients have been admitted. This scenario is a manipulation separate from the patient admission process described in the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
