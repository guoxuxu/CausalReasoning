  "Explanation": "According to the code logic within the TrafficSystem class, traffic lights turn on when the number of cars exceeds 10. This scenario presumes no external intervention (like manually manipulating the traffic light system) and follows from the system's automatic response to increased traffic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
