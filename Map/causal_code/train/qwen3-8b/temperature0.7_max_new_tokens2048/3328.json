  "Explanation": "Setting 'tax_percentage' to zero removes the tax component, thus making 'total_tax' equal to 0. This results in 'final_revenue' equaling 'total_sales', which is simply the sum of 'sales_figures'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
