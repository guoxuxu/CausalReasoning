  "Explanation": "Setting the activity level to 0 removes the bonus of (activity_level * 10) from the 'adjusted_index'. Given the formula, unless there's any other variable that can compensate this (there isn't as per the code), 'adjusted_index' will decrease.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
