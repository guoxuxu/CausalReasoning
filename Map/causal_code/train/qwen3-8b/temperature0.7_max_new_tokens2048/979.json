  "Explanation": "An intervention that alters the budget inherently impacts sales. Thus, an increase in sales following this change does not exclusively imply a change in marketing_quality because the budget itself is capable of influencing sales outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
