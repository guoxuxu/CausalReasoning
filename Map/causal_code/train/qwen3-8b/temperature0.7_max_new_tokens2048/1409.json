  "Explanation": "At a fixed humidity of 50 and the same temperature, the feels_like method would compute a lower feels_like temperature due to lack of adjustment from humidity. Thus, with a lower feels_like temperature, John is more likely to decide to wear a coat.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
