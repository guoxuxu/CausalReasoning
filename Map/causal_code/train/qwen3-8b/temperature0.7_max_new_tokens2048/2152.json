  "Problem": "def update_users(active_users, transactions, year):\n    updated_users = set()\n    for user in active_users:\n        user_transactions = [t for t in transactions if t['user_id'] == user and t['year'] == year]\n        revenue = sum(t['amount'] for t in user_transactions)\n        if revenue > 5000:\n            updated_users.add(user)\n    return updated_users\",\n\nDoes a larger updated_users set imply a greater number of transactions?",
  "Explanation": "A larger updated_users set does not necessarily imply more transactions overall; it suggests that more of the existing transactions involved higher spending by active users, sufficient to surpass the revenue threshold.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
