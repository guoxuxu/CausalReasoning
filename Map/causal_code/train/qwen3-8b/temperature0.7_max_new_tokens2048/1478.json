  "Explanation": "Changing the activity to 'indoor activities' through intervention doesn't imply that the original weather was rainy. The intervention might overwrite the activity regardless of the weather conditions. Therefore, we cannot confidently infer the original weather status from the altered activity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
