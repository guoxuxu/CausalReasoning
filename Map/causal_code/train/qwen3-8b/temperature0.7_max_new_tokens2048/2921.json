  "Explanation": "Even with the intervention where dailyCigaretteCount is reset to 0, a true value in isLungProblem can be due to other factors not accounted in this simplistic model. Thus, it does not conclusively imply incorrect reporting of the initial condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
