  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  adjusted_data = data ** 2\n  result = adjusted_data * 5\n  return result\n\nvalue = 10\nprocessed_value = process_data(value)\nprint(processed_value)\",\n\nIf observing changes in 'processed_value', can altering the multiplier inside 'process_data' help infer original 'value' more accurately?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the multiplier affects the scale of the output but does not inherently provide more accuracy or information about the original 'value'. The transformation (squaring, followed by scaling) obscures the original 'value' linear proportionality and simply changing the multiplier does not reveal more about the specific 'value', especially given the potential for multiple values leading to the same output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
