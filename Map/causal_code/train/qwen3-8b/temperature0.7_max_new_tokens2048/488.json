  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    factors = {'a': 10, 'b': 5, 'c': 7}\n    result = 1\n    for d in data:\n        if d['type'] == 'multiply':\n            result *= factors[d['key']]\n        elif d['type'] == 'add':\n            result += factors[d['key']]\n    return result\",\n\nAssuming the function was modified to only ever multiply results, and the final result equates to a multiplication of all factors in 'data', can we conclude all keys from data were 'multiply'?",
  "Explanation": "If the function is restricted to only multiplying results and the final computation matches the multiplication of all factors present in 'data', then all data type must have been 'multiply' as adding would have altered the mathematics fundamentally.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
