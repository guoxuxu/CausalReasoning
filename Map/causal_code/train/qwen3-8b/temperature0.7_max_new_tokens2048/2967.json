  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'sales' in data: \n        data['revenue'] = data['sales'] * data['price'] \n    if data['revenue'] > 1000: \n        data['category'] = 'High' \n    else: \n        data['category'] = 'Low' \n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'category' is 'High', does it indicate that 'sales' were also high?",
  "Explanation": "A 'High' category indicates high 'revenue', which is a product of both 'sales' and 'price'. High 'revenue' could be caused by either high 'sales', high 'price', or both. Thus, a 'High' 'category' does not necessarily mean that 'sales' were high; it could also be due to a high 'price'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
