  "Explanation": "Observing snow suggests temperature conditions below 0, but raising the humidity as an intervention does not inform or validate temperature causality. Snow could be from earlier conditions, an intervention does not establish a causal link to what temperature was before the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
