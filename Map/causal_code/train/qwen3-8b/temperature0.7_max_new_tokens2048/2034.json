  "Explanation": "Changing the weatherType to 'rainy' directly influences the output of reportWeather method when feel is 'hot'. Since 'rainy' isn't associated with 'Stay hydrated!', the next conditional recognized is 'Cool off!'. This question explores the causal impact with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
