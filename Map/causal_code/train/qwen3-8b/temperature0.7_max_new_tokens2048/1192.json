  "Problem": "def compute_salary(base_salary, performance_rating, years_of_experience): \n\\tbonus_percentage = 0.05 * performance_rating \n\\tbonus = base_salary * bonus_percentage \n\\tif years_of_experience > 5: \n\\t\\tbonus += 1000 \n\\treturn base_salary + bonus\",\n\nIf the performance rating increases, would the total calculated salary necessarily increase, assuming no changes to other inputs?",
  "Explanation": "In the given function, an increase in the performance rating directly increases the bonus_percentage, which in turn increases the bonus. Since the total salary is computed as the sum of the base_salary and bonus, this directly results in an increase in the total salary.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
