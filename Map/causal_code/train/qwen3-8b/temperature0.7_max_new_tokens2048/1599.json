  "Explanation": "This question tests the understanding from cause (discount rate) to effect (total sales) without intervention. Since the formula applies a discount based on the rate to the total price of units sold, an increase in discount rate would directly decrease total sales by increasing the discount amount assuming all else remains constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
