  "Problem": "WeatherSystem Python Class\",\n\nIf observed humidity reduction, was it because the wind speed was controlled?",
  "Explanation": "Humidity reduction could also occur naturally from a seasonal change to 'summer,' which decreases humidity by 10. Thus, it cannot be definitively concluded from humidity reduction alone that wind speed was manually controlled.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
