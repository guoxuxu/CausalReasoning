  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulation { private int humidity; private int temperature; public WeatherSimulation(int initialHumidity, int initialTemperature) { this.humidity = initialHumidity; this.temperature = initialTemperature; } public void increaseHumidity(int increment) { this.humidity += increment; if (this.humidity > 90) { this.temperature += 2; } } public int getHumidity() { return humidity; } public int getTemperature() { return temperature; } public void heatUp(int increment) { this.temperature += increment; if (this.temperature > 30) { this.humidity += 5; } } }\",\n\nDoes increasing the temperature directly affect the humidity in the simulator?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, the method 'heatUp' increases 'temperature' and if 'temperature' exceeds 30, it also increases 'humidity' by 5. This shows a direct causal effect from 'temperature' to 'humidity' without external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
