  "Problem": "def analyze_data(data):\n    height = data['height']\n    age = data['age']\n    weight = age * 2 + 10\n    if height > 170:\n        fitness = 'high'\n    else:\n        fitness = 'low'\n    return {'weight': weight, 'fitness': fitness}\",\n\nIf the age increases, will the weight reported by the function also increase?",
  "Explanation": "The weight is directly calculated as twice the age plus ten, so any increase in age directly increases the weight without any other intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
