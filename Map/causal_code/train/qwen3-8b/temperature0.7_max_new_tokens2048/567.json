  "Explanation": "Increasing the vaccination rate increases the immunity level according to the calculate_immunity method. Since a higher immunity level can lead to 'pathogen contained' if exceeding a threshold (in this case 100), augmenting the vaccination rate would more likely result in containing the pathogen.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
