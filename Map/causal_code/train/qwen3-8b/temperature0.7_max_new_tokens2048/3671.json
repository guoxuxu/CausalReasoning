  "Explanation": "The recommendation gives an indication of the step range: 'Increase walking' suggests less than 5000 steps, 'Maintain' suggests between 5000 and 9999 steps, and 'Well done on active lifestyle' indicates 10000 steps or more.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
