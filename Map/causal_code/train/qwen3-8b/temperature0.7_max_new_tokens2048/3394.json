  "Problem": "def price_calculator(age, student, coupon_code):\n    base_price = 100\n    age_discount = 20 if age < 18 else 0\n    student_discount = 10 if student else 0\n    coupon_discount = 30 if coupon_code == 'SAVE30' else 0\n    final_price = base_price - age_discount - student_discount - coupon_discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf a person's age is less than 18, will the final price be less than the base price, assuming no other factors are considered?",
  "Explanation": "The function applies an age discount of 20 when the age is less than 18, directly reducing the final price below the base price of 100. No other factors like being a student or having a coupon influence this outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
