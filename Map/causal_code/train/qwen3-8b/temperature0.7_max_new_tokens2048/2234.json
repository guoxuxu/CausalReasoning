  "Explanation": "The condition for adjustment, based on the adjust_heat method, only triggers if humans are not comfortable, which relates directly to when the temperature is outside the comfortable range.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
