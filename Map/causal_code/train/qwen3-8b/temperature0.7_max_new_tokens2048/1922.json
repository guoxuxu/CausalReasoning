  "Explanation": "While a significant increase in total sales might suggest more purchases or higher value purchases, it is not a definitive indication of more high-value purchases specifically. Sales could also increase due to a larger number of smaller-value transactions or prolonged periods of the discount being active, not necessarily just from high-value purchases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
