  "Explanation": "To change the weather condition from 'Cold' to 'Hot', the 'setTemperature' method must be invoked with a new temperature, necessarily above 30, as per the logic in 'determineWeather'. This is an action or intervention that specifically modifies the temperature to achieve the desired weather state.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
