  "Explanation": "In the code, the only condition under which the weather status changes to 'rainy' is if the humidity is greater than 70. Thus, observing a 'rainy' status directly indicates high humidity above 70, as there are no other conditions set for 'rainy' status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
