  "Explanation": "According to the code, the weather status is determined solely by the temperature if it is strictly greater than 20 it will be 'sunny'. Since it increased from 15 to 25 (which is greater than 20), it would be 'sunny.', and there is no intervention on other variables that could change this conclusion.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
