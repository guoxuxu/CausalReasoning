  "Problem": "def compute_scores(grades, bonus_enabled, penalty_enabled):\n    base_score = sum(grades) / len(grades)\n    if bonus_enabled:\n        bonus = max(grades)\n        base_score += bonus\n    if penalty_enabled:\n        penalty = min(grades)\n        base_score -= penalty\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf the value of `bonus_enabled` is changed from False to True without intervention, will `base_score` increase?",
  "Explanation": "Changing `bonus_enabled` from False to True activates the conditional code block inside the function, adding the highest grade (bonus) to the `base_score`, thus increasing it.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
