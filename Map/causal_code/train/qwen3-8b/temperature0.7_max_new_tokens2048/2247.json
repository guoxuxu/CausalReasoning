  "Problem": "public class HealthSystem { private int health = 100; public void TakeDamage(int damage) { health -= damage; if (health < 0) { health = 0; } } public void Heal(int amount) { health += amount; if (health > 100) { health = 100; } } public int GetHealth() { return health; } }\",\n\nIf the TakeDamage method is called with a high damage value, will the GetHealth method return a value less than it was before the damage?",
  "Explanation": "The TakeDamage method decreases the health value based on the amount of damage input. If the input damage is high, the resulting health after the method call will certainly be less than before, unless the health was already at zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
