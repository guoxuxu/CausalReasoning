  "Explanation": "Even if an intervention adjusts the price, a discounted_price of 80 does not solely indicate that is_member was True. The final price could also be adjusted by altering the base price. Without knowing the specific change to the price due to the intervention, is_member's value cannot be definitely known from the resulting price alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
