  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data:\n        if data['age'] > 50:\n            data['risk'] = 'high'\n        else:\n            data['risk'] = 'low'\n    else:\n        data['risk'] = 'unknown'\n    return data\",\n\nIf a person's age is over 50, will the risk automatically be categorized as 'high'?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, the function `process_data` checks if the key 'age' is present in the data dictionary. If the age is greater than 50, it explicitly sets the 'risk' key to 'high' without any other intervening conditions influencing this categorization.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
