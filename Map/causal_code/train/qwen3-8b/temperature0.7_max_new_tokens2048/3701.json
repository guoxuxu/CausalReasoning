  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"A simple inventory system that manages orders and stock for items. When an order is made for an item, the stock quantity decreases. If the stock goes below a minimum threshold, a restock action is triggered automatically.\",\n    \"code\": \"class InventorySystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stock = {'apple': 50, 'banana': 30}\n        self.min_threshold = {'apple': 10, 'banana': 5}\n\n    def order_item(self, item_name, quantity):\n        if item_name in self.stock:\n            self.stock[item_name] -= quantity\n            if self.stock[item_name] < self.min_threshold[item_name]:\n                self.restock_item(item_name)\n\n    def restock_item(self, item_name):\n        self.stock[item_name] += 100\n\"\n  },\n\nGiven that a restock was not initiated, can we infer that the stock did not drop below the present threshold at the time of the last order?",
  "Explanation": "Restocking is contingent upon the stock falling below the threshold. The absence of restocking actions thus indicates that stock levels were maintained above the threshold level after the most recent order transactions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
