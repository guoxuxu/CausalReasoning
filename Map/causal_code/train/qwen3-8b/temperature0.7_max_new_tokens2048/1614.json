  "Problem": "def manage_inventory(item, sales): \n    if item.stock < 10: \n        item.reorder(30) \n    item.stock -= sales \n    if sales > 20: \n        item.create_discount(5) \n    return item.stock\",\n\nIf at the end of the day the stock level of an item is observed to be significantly higher, did the store likely implement an intervention to increase the reorder amount during the last run of manage_inventory?",
  "Explanation": "Though an increased stock level might lead one to think that reorder amount was increased, the original code does not provide such a dynamic allocation capability within the manage_inventory function without manual intervention. A higher end-of-day stock could also be due to lower sales or original higher stock; not necessarily because of increased reorder amount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
