  "Explanation": "Salary can be reduced through other methods apart from reducing education years, such as increasing the negative impact of the noise term in the salary's calculation, or by direct intervention on the salary formula itself (e.g., reducing the base salary or coefficients). Therefore, a reduction in salary due to an intervention does not necessarily imply a reduction in education years.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
