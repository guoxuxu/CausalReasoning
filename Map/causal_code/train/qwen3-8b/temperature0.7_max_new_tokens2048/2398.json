  "Problem": "from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\n# Loading the diabetes dataset\nX, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)\n\n# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Creating a RandomForest Classifier\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier()\n\n# Fitting the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Predicting the test set results\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\",\n\nObserving an improved prediction accuracy after setting a specific 'random_state', can we conclude that this specific 'random_state' is generally optimal for modeling?",
  "Explanation": "The improvement in prediction accuracy with a specific 'random_state' might be due to particular characteristics of the split that favor the model's performance with given data, and might not generalize as the best option for other datasets or even different splits of the same data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
