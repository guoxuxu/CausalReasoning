  "Explanation": "An increase in healthy population percentage suggests recovering or preventing illness, rather than the result of a new pandemic. A pandemic increase results in a higher ill population, opposite to the observed effect of increasing health percentage; thus, it cannot be concluded that such a pandemic occurred based on this rise in health.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
