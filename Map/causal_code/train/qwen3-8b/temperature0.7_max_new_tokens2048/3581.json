  "Explanation": "Considering the 'decide_activity' function's logic and the intervention altering the activity to 'picnic', it necessitates that the cause (weather) was set to 'sunny'. There are no other stated conditions in the code that lead to a 'picnic' activity, affirming the certainty of sunny weather as the intervened cause for this effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
