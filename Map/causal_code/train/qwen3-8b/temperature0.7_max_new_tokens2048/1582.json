  "Explanation": "As the code dictates, for rain to occur, the temperature must both be below 20 degrees (to trigger cloudy weather) and subsequently fall below 15 degrees while it is cloudy. Non-rainy conditions mean one of these conditions wasn't met; most directly, it tells us that the temperature didn’t drop below 15 degrees after being cloudy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
