  "Explanation": "Decreases in inflation might not directly correlate with lower interest rate caps due to other possible intervening factors such as external economic pressures, supply chain improvements, or even direct subsidies from the government that could help stabilize prices independently of interest rates.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
