  "Explanation": "While sunny weather results in light traffic, which in turn results in a 30-minute travel time, seeing a 30-minute travel time does not necessarily imply it was sunny, as other unmodeled factors could influence traffic and travel time.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
