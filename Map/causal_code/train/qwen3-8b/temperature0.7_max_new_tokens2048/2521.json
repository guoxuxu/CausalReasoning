  "Problem": "See above Python code example\",\n\nWhen the intervention to reduce pollution by 40 is applied to an environment with 90 pollution, will the resulting weather be sunny?",
  "Explanation": "With pollution initially at 90, reducing it by 40 brings the level down to 50. According to the update_weather, when pollution is between 31 and 80, the weather is 'sunny'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
