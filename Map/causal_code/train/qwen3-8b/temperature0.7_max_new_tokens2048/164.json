  "Explanation": "Decreasing final_sales through intervention does not necessarily imply the removal of the 'sales' key. The decrease could be due to lowering the 'sales' value itself or setting a smaller growth factor independently of whether 'sales' is present or not.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
