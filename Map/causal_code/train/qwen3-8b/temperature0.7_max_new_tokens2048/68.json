  "Problem": "class Experiment {\n  int temperature;\n  int pressure;\n  boolean result;\n  public Experiment(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.2); // Assumes pressure is dependent on temperature\n    this.result = this.pressure > 100; // Result is true if pressure is greater than 100\n  }\n  public void setTemperature(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.1); // Changing the dependency formula here\n    this.result = this.pressure > 110; // Also changing the threshold for result\n  }\n}\",\n\nKnowing the result turned true after setting the temperature to 95, can we deduce that the initial temperature setting methodology was still in place?",
  "Explanation": "Given the pressure-recalculation and the new threshold for the result set in `setTemperature`, the fact that the result is true after the intervention does not necessarily imply that the initial temperature-to-pressure calculation was still used. The new setting could be in place, and new conditions met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
