  "Explanation": "Setting an intervention where the temperature is always 23 degrees ensures that the temperature condition (>20) for a good mood is always met. The only remaining factor affecting mood is whether it is raining. Provided it doesn't rain, 'Go to the park' will be chosen more often due to the mood being happy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
