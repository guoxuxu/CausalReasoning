  "Problem": "[See above Python code snippet]\",\n\nIf sunlight increases without any changes to water, will plant growth increase?",
  "Explanation": "The plant growth depends functionally on both sunlight and water levels; higher sunlight above a threshold leads to an increase in plant growth if other conditions are stable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
