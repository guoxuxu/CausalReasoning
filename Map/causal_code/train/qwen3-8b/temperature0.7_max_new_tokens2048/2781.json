  "Explanation": "A rain probability of 20% could be because of other reasons such as humility being less than 75%, irrespective of the temperature given the conditions stated in the method `calculate_rain_probability`. The evidence is insufficient to infer the exact temperature without more information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
