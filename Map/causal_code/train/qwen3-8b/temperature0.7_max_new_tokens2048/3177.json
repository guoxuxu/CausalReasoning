  "Explanation": "A decrease in final_price could be influenced by either applying a discount or an originally higher tax rate adjustment back to a lower rate. Merely observing a lower final_price isn't sufficient to definitively conclude a discount was applied without knowing about other possible interventions or initial conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
