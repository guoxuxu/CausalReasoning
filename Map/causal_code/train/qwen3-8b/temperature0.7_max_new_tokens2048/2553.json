  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_value): \n  clean_data = [x for x in data if x > filter_value]\n  summary = sum(clean_data) / len(clean_data)\n  return summary\n\ndata_list = [5, 15, 20, 25, 30]\nfilter_threshold = 10\nresult = process_data(data_list, filter_threshold)\",\n\nIf we modify the filter_threshold, will it affect the result?",
  "Explanation": "Altering filter_threshold changes which elements of data_list are included in clean_data. A higher threshold excludes more items, potentially lowering the summary, whereas a lower threshold includes more items, potentially increasing the summary. Thus, intervention by modifying filter_threshold directly affects the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
