  "Explanation": "According to the 'increasePatientCount' method, there is an additional 20% increase in the patient count during the flu season when new patients are admitted. Therefore, initiating the flu season leads to an increase in patients assuming new admissions occur.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
