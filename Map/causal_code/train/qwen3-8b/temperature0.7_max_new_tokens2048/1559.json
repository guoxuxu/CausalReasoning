  "Explanation": "Setting `on_sale` to False will prevent the discount from being applied, thereby keeping the price of the product higher. Assuming no change in the customer's budget, the customer would not be able to afford the product if its price remains too high relative to their budget.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
