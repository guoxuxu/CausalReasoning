  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    if flag:\n        data = normalize_data(data)\n    data = enhance_data(data)\n    result = analyze_data(data)\n    return result\n\ndef normalize_data(data):\n    return [x / max(data) for x in data]\n\ndef enhance_data(data):\n    return [x + 1 for x in data]\n\ndef analyze_data(data):\n    return sum(data) / len(data)\",\n\nIf we intervene and skip the data normalization and enhancement steps, will the output of analyze_data be solely determined by the input data?",
  "Explanation": "By intervening to skip normalization and enhancement, the output of analyze_data becomes a direct calculation based solely on the original input data, provided the analyze_data function itself remains unchanged and just calculates the mean of the current data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
