  "Explanation": "Increasing humidity can lead to an increased probability of rain, according to the willItRain() method's logic. If the humidity crosses certain thresholds (greater than 70 or 50), the method explicitly increases the rainProbability based on those conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
