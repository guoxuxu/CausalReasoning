  "Explanation": "Increasing the number_of_shops directly by intervention will result in higher number_of_customers through the daily_customers method, assuming a constant or proportional increase_factor. This in return, assuming a constant average spend per customer, increases the total revenue.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
