  "Explanation": "A true isLungProblem status indicates high likelihood of exposure and high cigarette count, but it's not definitive for counts strictly greater than 10 without knowing smoke exposure status. Both isSmokeExposure and high cigarette count (more than 10) are preconditions for isLungProblem to be true.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
