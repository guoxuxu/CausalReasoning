  "Problem": "def calculate_prices(base_price, discount, tax_rate):\n    discounted_price = base_price - (base_price * discount)\n    final_price = discounted_price + (discounted_price * tax_rate)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the base_price increases, will the final_price definitely increase, assuming discount and tax_rate remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "The increase in base_price increases the discounted_price because the discount percentage remains constant. Consequently, this leads to an increase in the final_price, as the tax applied to the higher discounted_price will also increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
