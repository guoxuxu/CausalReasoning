  "Explanation": "While being a smoker adds significantly (2.0) to the health risk score, high cholesterol or advanced age can also increase the risk independently, resulting in high overall health risk scores even for non-smokers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
