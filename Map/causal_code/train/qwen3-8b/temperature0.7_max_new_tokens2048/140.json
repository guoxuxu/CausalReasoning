  "Explanation": "Transition from a 'High' to a 'Moderate' risk category indicates a change in BMI range according to the code logic. Since 'High' risk is assigned to BMIs of 25 and above, and 'Moderate' risk is assigned to BMIs from 18.5 to below 25, this shift conclusively points to a decrease in BMI.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
