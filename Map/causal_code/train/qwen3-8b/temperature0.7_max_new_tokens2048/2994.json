  "Explanation": "Increasing the product quality from 7 to 9 pushes it over the threshold of 8, which, according to the code, adds 2 points to the base rating. Thus, the store's rating will increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
