  "Explanation": "The 'receiveShipment' method adds items to the stock and checks if the stock is positive and the warehouse is not already open. If both conditions are met, it opens the warehouse. Here, since the initial stock is 0 and the method is called with a positive number of items, the stock becomes positive, triggering the warehouse to open.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
