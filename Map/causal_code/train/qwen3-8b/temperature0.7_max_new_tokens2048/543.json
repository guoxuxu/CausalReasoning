  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  private int temperature;\n  private boolean rainy;\n\n  public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean isRainy) {\n    temperature = temp;\n    rainy = isRainy;\n  }\n\n  public void changeWeather(int newTemp, boolean newRainy) {\n    temperature = newTemp;\n    rainy = newRainy;\n  }\n\n  public boolean isBadWeather() {\n    return temperature < 20 && rainy;\n  }\n\n  public int getTemperature() {\n    return temperature;\n  }\n\n  public boolean isRainy() {\n    return rainy;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf you set the rainy condition to true and increase the temperature to 25 degrees, will it lead to bad weather?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the rainy condition to true but increasing the temperature above 20 degrees violates the bad weather condition of temperature being less than 20. Hence, it will not result in bad weather.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
