  "Explanation": "In the given scenario, the only condition set for using an umbrella is that it is raining, though this is contingent on temperature being below 20 degrees. Therefore, observing more people using umbrellas typically implies it has started raining, but it must be noted that this inference might not always hold true if the temperature is not accounted for.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
