  "Problem": "def process_data(data, cond): \n  if cond: \n    data = double_values(data) \n  else: \n    data = halve_values(data) \n  processed_data = filter_positive(data) \n  return processed_data \n\ndef double_values(numbers): \n  return [x * 2 for x in numbers] \n\ndef halve_values(numbers): \n  return [x / 2 for x in numbers] \n\ndef filter_positive(numbers): \n  return [x for x in numbers if x > 0]\",\n\nCan altering whether the numbers passed to process_data are positive or negative indicate the flow of data through the double_values or halve_values function?",
  "Explanation": "The nature of the numbers (positive/negative) affects whether they are retained after processing by filter_positive. This outcome can be traced backward to whether they were doubled or halved (indicating flow through double_values or halve_values respectively), depending on the sign and multiplication/division applied.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
