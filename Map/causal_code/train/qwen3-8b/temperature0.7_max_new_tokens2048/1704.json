  "Problem": "Python code snippet provided above\",\n\nDoes a decrease in predator_population lead to an increase in plant_population?",
  "Explanation": "The predator_population impacts the herbivore_population but has no direct causal relationship to the plant_population. Changes in predator numbers affect herbivores, not plants directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "predator_population → herbivore_population; herbivore_population → plant_population"
