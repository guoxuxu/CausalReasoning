  "Problem": "\n  def sales_performance(income, marketing_spend):\n      sales = income * 0.5\n      profit = sales - marketing_spend\n      ROI = profit / marketing_spend\n      return ROI\n\n  yearly_income = 80000\n  marketing_budget = 5000\n  return_on_investment = sales_performance(yearly_income, marketing_budget)\n  \"\"\",\n\nIf return_on_investment is observed to decrease, did marketing_spend necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in return_on_investment could be due to either an increase in marketing_spend or a decrease in sales (and hence profit), which is not solely determined by marketing_spend but also by the income.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
