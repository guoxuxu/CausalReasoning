  "Explanation": "A lower 'total' might result from either a condition 'B', which directly reduces the total, or the presence of smaller numbers in 'values'. Without knowing the values or any intervention on them, a direct implication about 'condition' being 'B' cannot be made.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
