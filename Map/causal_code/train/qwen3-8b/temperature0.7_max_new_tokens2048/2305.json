  "Problem": "def weather_impact(weather, season):\n    if weather == 'rainy' and season == 'winter':\n        return 'snowy'\n    elif weather == 'sunny' and season == 'summer':\n        return 'hot'\n    elif weather == 'cloudy' or (weather == 'rainy' and season == 'summer'):\n        return 'cool'\n    else:\n        return 'mild'\",\n\nIf an external system could control the season and set it always to 'summer', would setting the weather to 'sunny' always result in the function returning 'hot'?",
  "Explanation": "By intervening and fixing the season to 'summer', setting the weather to 'sunny' ensures that the function returns 'hot' according to its conditions. Other potential outputs, such as 'cool' if the weather were 'cloudy' or 'rainy', are not possible under this intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
