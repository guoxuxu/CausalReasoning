  "Explanation": "The return of 'Warm' from 'check_temp' indicates that the temperature is above 25, but this condition can be met either by the initial state of temperature or via other interventions like multiple smaller increments. The 'heat' method is not necessarily the sole cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
