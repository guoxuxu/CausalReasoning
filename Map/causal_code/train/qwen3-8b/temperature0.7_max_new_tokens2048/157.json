  "Explanation": "The method `update_weather` changes the values of `temperature` and `humidity`, which are directly used in the conditional logic of `is_rainy()` to determine if it is rainy. Therefore, updating these values impacts the outcome of the `is_rainy()` method, demonstrating a cause to effect relationship without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
