  "Explanation": "Increasing the humidity would generally increase the feels_like temperature. If John is not wearing a coat, this likely implies the feels_like temperature is already in a comfortable range. Further increasing the humidity/feels_like temperature would make it less likely, not more, for John to wear a coat.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
