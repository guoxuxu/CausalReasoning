  "Problem": "Above Python code\",\n\nIf we intervene to set the heating system to increase output regardless of occupant count or external temperatures, will the internal temperature increase?",
  "Explanation": "Directly manipulating the heating system to increase its output will elevate the internal temperature, independent of other variables such as occupancy or external temperature. This intervention directly targets the primary cause of internal temperature change, i.e., the heating output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Heating System Output → Internal Temperature; Occupant Count → Heating System Output; External Temperature → Heating System Output; Occupant Count → Internal Temperature; External Temperature → Internal Temperature"
