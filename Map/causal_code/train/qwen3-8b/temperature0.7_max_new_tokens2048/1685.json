  "Problem": "def compute_scores(temperature, pressure):\n    if temperature > 100:\n        score = 20\n    else:\n        score = 10\n    if pressure > 5:\n        score += 15\n    else:\n        score += 5\n    return score\",\n\nIf you manually set the temperature to 90 degrees and adjust the pressure to be greater than 5, will this alter the final score?",
  "Explanation": "Setting temperature to 90 degrees will set the base score to 10, but increasing the pressure above 5 will add 15 to the score, making the score change compared to other combinations of temperature and pressure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
