  "Explanation": "Increasing the initial balance allows the user to afford more or higher-priced products, thus potentially adding more items to the cart. This is a cause (increase in balance) to effect (more products in the cart) scenario without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
