  "Explanation": "Calling increaseHumidity() directly does not trigger triggerRainfallEvent(). This action only increases humidity without leading to a rainfall event, as rainfall event is triggered only when adjustEnvironment() is called after setting isRaining to true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
