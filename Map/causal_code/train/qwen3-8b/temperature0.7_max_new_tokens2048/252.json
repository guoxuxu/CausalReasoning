  "Explanation": "Resetting the weight each day removes any evidence of weight change due to high steps from the previous days. Any analysis based on daily reset weights would fail to identify the causal relationship between high step counts and weight loss.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
