  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  private int temperature;\n  private boolean rainy;\n\n  public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean isRainy) {\n    temperature = temp;\n    rainy = isRainy;\n  }\n\n  public void changeWeather(int newTemp, boolean newRainy) {\n    temperature = newTemp;\n    rainy = newRainy;\n  }\n\n  public boolean isBadWeather() {\n    return temperature < 20 && rainy;\n  }\n\n  public int getTemperature() {\n    return temperature;\n  }\n\n  public boolean isRainy() {\n    return rainy;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the temperature is significantly decreased, will it definitely result in bad weather?",
  "Explanation": "Decreasing the temperature alone does not necessarily result in bad weather, as 'bad weather' is defined as being both cold (less than 20 degrees) and rainy. The rainy condition needs to be true as well.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
