  "Problem": "def update_score(age, score, training_completed): \n    if age > 18: \n        score += 10 \n    if training_completed: \n        score += 20 \n    return score\",\n\nIf a person's score increased, does it imply they completed the training?",
  "Explanation": "Score could be increased either by the person being older than 18 or by having completed the training. The sole fact that the score increased does not necessarily imply the training was completed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
