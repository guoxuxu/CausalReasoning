  "Explanation": "The 'update_heart_rate' method in the class increases the heart rate depending on the level of activity ('high' increases by 20, 'medium' by 10, 'low' does not alter it), which establishes a direct causal relationship from cause (activity level) to effect (heart rate) without any external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
