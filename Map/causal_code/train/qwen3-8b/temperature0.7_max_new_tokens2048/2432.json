  "Explanation": "The low ratio (effect) does not inherently mean high pressure (cause); it can also result from very low or zero temperature as seen from the calculation 'z = y / x'. A zero or near-zero temperature can also lead to a low ratio regardless of pressure.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
