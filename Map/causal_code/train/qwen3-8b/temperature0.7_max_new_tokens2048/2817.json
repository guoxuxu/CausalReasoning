  "Explanation": "Although setting 'cond' to True doubles values, which makes positive numbers even larger, setting it to False halves the values. Depending on the original data (e.g., large positive numbers), even halved values could still be all positive, making it incorrect to assume that 'cond' must have been True just from positive results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
