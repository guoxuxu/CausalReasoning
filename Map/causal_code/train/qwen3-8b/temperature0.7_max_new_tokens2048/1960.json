  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'views' in data and 'likes' in data: \n        popularity = data['views'] * data['likes'] \n        if popularity > 10000: \n            result = 'High' \n        else: \n            result = 'Low' \n    else: \n        result = 'Unknown' \n    return result\",\n\nIf the result is changed manually to 'Unknown', does this indicate that the keys 'views' or 'likes' were not present in the data?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, the result 'Unknown' is set only if either 'views' or 'likes' is missing in the data. Therefore, manually changing the result to 'Unknown' would imply simulating the scenario where these keys are absent.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
