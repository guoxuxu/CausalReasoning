  "Explanation": "The `turn_on` method checks if the temperature is below 50 before turning on and heating water. In this case, as the temperature is already 100 degrees, the water heater will not turn on or heat the water further since its only condition to activate heating is a temperature under 50.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
