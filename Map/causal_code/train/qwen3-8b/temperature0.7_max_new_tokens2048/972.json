  "Explanation": "In the equation 'y = 2 * x + e', an increase in 'e' directly leads to an increase in the variance of 'y' as 'e' is added directly to a deterministic function of 'x'. The magnitude of 'y' changes according to the alterations in 'e'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
