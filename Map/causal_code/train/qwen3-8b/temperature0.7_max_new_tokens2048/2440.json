  "Problem": "def sales_discount(prices, discount_rate=0.1): \n    discounted_prices = [] \n    for price in prices: \n        if price >= 50: \n            new_price = price - price * discount_rate \n            discounted_prices.append(new_price) \n        else: \n            discounted_prices.append(price) \n    return discounted_prices\",\n\nDoes having fewer items in 'discounted_prices' than in 'prices' indicate a programming error in the loop or conditional statements?",
  "Explanation": "The length of 'discounted_prices' remains equal to 'prices', as every item in 'prices' is processed to be either discounted or appended as is. The loop and conditionals are designed to handle each element exactly once, thus preserving the list's length.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
