  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand_factor, discount_applied):\n    base_price = price\n    if discount_applied:\n        price = price * 0.9  # 10% discount\n    demand = demand_factor * price\n    sales = price * demand\n    return sales\",\n\nIf 'sales' increase, can we infer that 'demand_factor' has definitely increased, given no information about changes in 'price' or 'discount_applied'?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in 'sales' can be caused by either an increase in 'demand_factor', a rise in 'price', or a change in 'discount_applied'. Without knowing the status of these variables, we cannot definitively conclude that 'demand_factor' alone has caused the increase in 'sales'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
