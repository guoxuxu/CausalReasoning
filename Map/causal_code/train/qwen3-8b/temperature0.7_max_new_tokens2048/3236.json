  "Explanation": "Removing the exception block means that any error during the integer cast of 'value' would not be captured and handled. Thus, encountering a non-integer 'value' would result in a crash or an unhandled exception, preventing the further execution of the code which includes setting the 'status' to 'success'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
