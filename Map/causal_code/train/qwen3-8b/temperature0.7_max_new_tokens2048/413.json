  "Problem": "def update_stock(prices, sales, delivery):\n  stock = { 'apples': 100, 'bananas': 120, 'oranges': 90 }\n  for item in sales:\n    if item in stock:\n      stock[item] -= sales[item]\n  for item in delivery:\n    if item in stock:\n      stock[item] += delivery[item]\n  for item, price in prices.items():\n    if price < 0.5 and stock[item] > 100:\n      sales[item] = stock[item] - 100 \n  return stock\",\n\nIf delivery quantity increases, will it impact the final stock count without sales and price adjustments?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the delivery quantity directly adds to the stock count of the specific item if other variables (sales and price) remain constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
