  "Explanation": "The code specifies that individuals with diabetes but under the age of 50 will have a risk level of 'Medium', not 'Low'. Therefore, setting the age to under 50 does not guarantee a 'Low' risk level if the person has diabetes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
