  "Explanation": "Since weatherType is set to 'rainy', the prepareForDay method explicitly checks for this condition and returns 'Carry an umbrella'. There is a direct causal link between the weatherType being 'rainy' and the output of the method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
