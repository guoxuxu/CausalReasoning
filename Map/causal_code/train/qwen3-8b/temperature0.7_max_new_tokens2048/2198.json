  "Explanation": "A decrease in the final balance could be due to multiple factors such as a decrease in the initial account balance, a decrease in the interest rate, or fewer years calculated. Decreasing the interest rate is just one possibility; therefore, a reduced final balance does not necessarily imply that the interest rate decreased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
