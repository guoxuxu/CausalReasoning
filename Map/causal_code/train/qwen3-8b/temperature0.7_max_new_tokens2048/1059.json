  "Explanation": "Observing the output 'Hot and sunny.' implies that it is neither raining nor snowing and the temperature is at least 35 degrees Celsius. If weather conditions were changed to not rain, and temperature was set to 36 through intervention, these conditions would produce the observed output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
