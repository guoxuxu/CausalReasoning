  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  if 'age' in data:\n    data['age'] = max(18, min(data.get('age', 30), 65))\n  if 'income' in data and data['age'] > 30:\n    data['income'] *= 1.2\n  return data\",\n\nIf 'income' was not modified in the output, can we infer that the intervention to set 'age' at 25 caused this?",
  "Explanation": "Since setting 'age' at 25 is below the threshold of 30 required to modify 'income', the lack of modification in 'income' can be attributed to this intervention where 'age' is set at a value less than 30.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
