  "Explanation": "The pump reporting 'Pump Stopped' only indicates that the pump was running before and is now off. It does not necessarily mean that the 'has_power' was changed; the pump can be stopped without altering the power status.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
