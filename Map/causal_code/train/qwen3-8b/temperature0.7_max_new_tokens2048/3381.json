  "Explanation": "In the scenario where warning_level changes to 'high' following an intervention, such as artificially setting max_temp, it indicates that avg_humidity was already meeting its conditional threshold (> 50). This response ties the effect (warning_level) back to the prerequisite conditions for both temperature and humidity, under the influence of an intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
