  "Explanation": "With intervention, where an external step ensures all inputs are devoid of 'bug', has_errors will remain False regardless of whether 'bug' was originally in the input or not. Therefore, the user_experience will not be affected by whether 'bug' was initially present since it's removed pre-evaluation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
