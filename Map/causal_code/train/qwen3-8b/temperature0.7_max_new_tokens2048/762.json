  "Explanation": "Changing the discountThreshold externally to below the current totalSales means that the next invocation of the updateSales method, even with a small positive amount, will now find the condition totalSales > discountThreshold true, thereby triggering applyDiscount and setting discountApplied to true.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
