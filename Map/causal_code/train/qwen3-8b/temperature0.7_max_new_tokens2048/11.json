  "Explanation": "Service order plays a critical role. If smaller orders are processed first, it might conserve inventory for later orders. Servicing smaller orders first can potentially leave enough inventory for the next order resulting in 'Order fulfilled'. Hence, changing the order sequence acts as an intervention that can modify the outcomes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
