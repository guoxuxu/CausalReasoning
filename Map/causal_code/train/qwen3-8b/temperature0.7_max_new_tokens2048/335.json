  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n    int temperature = 20;\n    boolean isRaining = false;\n\n    void setTemperature(int newTemp) {\n        temperature = newTemp;\n        if (temperature < 5) {\n            isRaining = true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    void makeItRain() {\n        isRaining = true;\n        if (isRaining) {\n            temperature -= 5;\n        }\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf we set the temperature to 2 using setTemperature method, will it necessarily start raining?",
  "Explanation": "According to the provided code in setTemperature, setting temperature below 5 automatically triggers the condition isRaining to become true, which implies it will start raining as a direct effect of lowering the temperature to 2.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
