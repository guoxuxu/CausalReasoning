  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private float temperature; private boolean raining; public void setTemperature(float temp) { temperature = temp; if (temp < 32) { raining = false; } } public boolean isRaining() { return raining; } public void startRain() { if (temperature > 50) { raining = true; } } }\",\n\nIf someone explicitly calls startRain() when the temperature is 55 degrees Fahrenheit, will it rain?",
  "Explanation": "When startRain() is called and the temperature is set above 50 degrees (as with 55 degrees), the code within startRain() will update the raining status to true, causing it to rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
