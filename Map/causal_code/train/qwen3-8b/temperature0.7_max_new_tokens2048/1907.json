  "Problem": "class Store {\n  private int customers = 0;\n  private int sales = 0;\n  \n  public void enterCustomer(int number) {\n    this.customers += number;\n  }\n\n  public void makeSale(int soldItems) {\n    this.sales += soldItems;\n  }\n\n  public int getCustomers() {\n    return this.customers;\n  }\n\n  public int getSales() {\n    return this.sales;\n  }\n\n  public void promotionalEvent(int discountRate) {\n    if (discountRate > 20) {\n      this.customers += 10;\n      this.sales += 50;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the store runs a promotional event with a high discount rate, will there be an increase in the number of customers?",
  "Explanation": "The promotional event method includes logic to increase the number of customers by 10 if the discount rate is greater than 20%. This represents a direct causal intervention where the promotional event (cause) directly leads to an increase in customers (effect).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
