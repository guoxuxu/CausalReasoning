  "Explanation": "'Insufficient stock' messages indicate that sales demands are not being met due to low inventory. This suggests that there is a need for intervention, such as ordering more stock to replenish inventory.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
