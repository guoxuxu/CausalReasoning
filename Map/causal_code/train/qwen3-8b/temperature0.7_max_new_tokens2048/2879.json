  "Problem": "def process_data(data_list):\n    processed_list = []\n    for data in data_list:\n        if data % 2 == 0:\n            processed_list.append(data * 10)\n        else:\n            processed_list.append(data + 10)\n    return processed_list\",\n\nIf the processed_list contains only even numbers, does it mean all original data points were even?",
  "Explanation": "Given the code logic, the only way for processed_list to contain only even numbers under the given operations (without any intervention) is if every input number was even. This is because odd numbers are made even only through addition of 10 in the else block, which changes them to even numbers; thus altering the sequence to be comprised of only even numbers but with higher values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
