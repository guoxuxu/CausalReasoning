  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, adjustment_factor, demand, supply):\n    if supply > demand:\n        adjustment_factor *= 0.9\n    else:\n        adjustment_factor *= 1.1\n    new_prices = {product: price * adjustment_factor for product, price in prices.items()}\n    return new_prices\",\n\nIf you could control the adjustment_factor to make it increase, should you decrease the supply?",
  "Explanation": "By artificially manipulating the input variables, decreasing the supply relative to demand moves us from the 'if' block to the 'else' block where the adjustment_factor is increased by multiplying it by 1.1. Thus, reducing supply in this situation leads directly to an increase in adjustment_factor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
