  "Problem": "def calculate_bonus(salary, performance_rating):\n    if performance_rating > 8:\n        bonus = salary * 0.2\n    elif performance_rating > 5:\n        bonus = salary * 0.1\n    else:\n        bonus = 0\n    return bonus\n\nsalary = 50000\nrating = 9\ncalculate_bonus(salary, rating)\",\n\nIf a bonus was reduced after a new policy that lowers bonuses based on rating, can we conclude that the particular employee's performance rating decreased?",
  "Explanation": "The reduction in bonus could be due to the policy change rather than an actual decrease in performance rating. The policy could reduce bonuses for all levels of performance, thus making it improper to infer a specific decrease in performance rating from the reduced bonus alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
