  "Problem": "def compute_values(x, y):\n    z = x * y\n    u = z + y\n    if x > 0:\n        v = x + 2\n    else:\n        v = x - 2\n    result = u * v\n    return result\",\n\nIf value of x increases, will it directly cause an increase in the result without modifying any other variable?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing x directly affects v when x > 0 (since v = x + 2). It also indirectly affects z, which influences u and ultimately the result. Therefore, an increase in x will increase the result without other interventions when x > 0.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
