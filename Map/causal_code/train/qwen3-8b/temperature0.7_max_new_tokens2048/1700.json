  "Explanation": "Noticing that a student needs support indicates elevated stress levels, which could indeed result from answering more than 5 questions. However, stress could also accumulate through answering multiple smaller quizzes or from external sources outside the scope of this specific quiz, thus it is not a definitive indicator of the number of questions answered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
