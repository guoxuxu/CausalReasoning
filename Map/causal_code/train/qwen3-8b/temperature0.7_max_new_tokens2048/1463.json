  "Explanation": "Increasing 'data_input' leads to a higher 'adjusted_data' since it is multiplied by 10 in the function. If 'adjusted_data' exceeds 50, the function returns 'High', leading to the execution of 'print(\\\"Value is above threshold.\\\")'. Therefore, increasing 'data_input' causes an increase in the probability of the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
