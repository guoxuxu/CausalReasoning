  "Explanation": "An increase in reward points by 200 points indicates 'premium' status at the time of reward calculation, but it could be due to an admin intervention setting the status or a deposit. The exact cause isn't determinable from the effect alone, without knowing the context of status change.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
