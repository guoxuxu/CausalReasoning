  "Problem": "Python code above\",\n\nCan observing the recommendation outcome help deduce the user's preferred genre?",
  "Explanation": "If a movie was recommended and its genre is known, knowing that a base score of 8 is allocated when genres match, one might infer that the recommended movie's genre could be the user's preferred genre, especially if there are no other ratings affecting the base score.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
