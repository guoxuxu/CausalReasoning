  "Explanation": "Changing the weather to 'rainy' alone does not guarantee that the accident_risk will be 'high' as it also depends on the traffic_light being red.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
