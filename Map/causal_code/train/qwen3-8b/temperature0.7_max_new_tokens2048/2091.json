  "Explanation": "Even if the water heater is repeatedly turned off, using a significant amount of water (more than 10 units) triggers a decrease in temperature by 10 degrees as per the 'use_water' method, which does not depend on whether the heater is on.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
