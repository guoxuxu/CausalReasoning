  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.9\n        else:\n            return price\n    elif season == 'winter':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.8\n        else:\n            return price * 1.1\n    else:\n        return price\",\n\nIf we introduce a mandatory 10% discount regardless of the season, will the sales depend on the season?",
  "Explanation": "Even with a mandatory discount, the final sales price still varies by season as the amount by which the price is reduced from the original differs between 'summer' and 'winter'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
