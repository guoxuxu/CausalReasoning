  "Explanation": "An increase in the sales record for an item (like bananas) indicates that the 'sell_item' method was successfully executed with that item. 'restock_item' increases inventory and does not influence sales records directly, hence an increment in sales records would not suggest that the 'restock_item' method was called.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
