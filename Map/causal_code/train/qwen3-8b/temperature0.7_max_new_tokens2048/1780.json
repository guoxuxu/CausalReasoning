  "Problem": "ClimateControl class managing a climate system.\",\n\nIf a user sets a custom humidity level, will the indoor humidity strictly match the user's setting?",
  "Explanation": "When a user intervention sets a new custom humidity level through `set_user_settings`, the `adjust_climate` method directly updates the indoor humidity to match the user-set value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
