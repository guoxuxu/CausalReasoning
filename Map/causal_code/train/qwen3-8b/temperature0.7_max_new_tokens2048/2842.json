  "Problem": "class ShoppingCart { constructor() { this.items = []; this.total = 0; } addItem(item) { this.items.push(item); if (item.onSale) { this.total += item.price * 0.8; } else { this.total += item.price; } } removeItem(itemIndex) { const item = this.items[itemIndex]; if (item) { this.total -= item.onSale ? item.price * 0.8 : item.price; this.items.splice(itemIndex, 1); } } }\",\n\nIf an item's price is increased, will the total variable in the ShoppingCart class also increase when the addItem method is called?",
  "Explanation": "The total variable increases when items are added to the cart. If the price of the item added is higher, the total will increase more than it would have with a lower price. This is a straightforward effect from the cause (increasing item price) without external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
