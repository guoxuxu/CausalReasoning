  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total_price = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == 'SAVE10' else 0.05 if coupon_code == 'SAVE5' else 0\n    discount = total_price * discount_rate\n    final_price = total_price - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nDoes a lower final price indicate the use of a 'SAVE10' coupon?",
  "Explanation": "A lower final price could be caused by either a 'SAVE10' or 'SAVE5' coupon or by the items themselves being priced lower or in smaller quantities, not uniquely identifying the use of 'SAVE10'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
