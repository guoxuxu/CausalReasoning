  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { void simulate(int days, boolean rainySeason) { for(int i = 0; i < days; i++) { if(rainySeason) { System.out.println('Rain'); } else { if(Math.random() > 0.5) { System.out.println('Sun'); } else { System.out.println('Cloudy'); } } } } }\",\n\nIf 'Sun' is consistently observed on the output, can it be concluded that Math.random() has been manipulated to exceed 0.5?",
  "Explanation": "Observing 'Sun' consistently does not conclusively indicate that Math.random() has been manipulated. 'Sun' can appear consistently due to natural variations of Math.random() values being frequently greater than 0.5 or the simulation running during non-rainy seasons under standard conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
