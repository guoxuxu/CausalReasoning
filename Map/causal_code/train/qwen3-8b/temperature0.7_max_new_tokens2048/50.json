  "Explanation": "The heat index being 'High heat index' depends on both high temperature and humidity. Simply observing 'High heat index' cannot conclusively determine that there was a specific increase in temperature without knowing the previous state, thus effect to cause relation here is not sufficient for inference.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
