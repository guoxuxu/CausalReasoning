  "Explanation": "Although calling setTrafficLightGreen() will make checkIfTrafficIsAllowed() return true, the initial value of isGreen might also be directly manipulated elsewhere in the class, or the light might have been set to green by operateTrafficLight method with true action. Thus, a true result from checkIfTrafficIsAllowed() doesn't definitively imply setTrafficLightGreen() was called.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
