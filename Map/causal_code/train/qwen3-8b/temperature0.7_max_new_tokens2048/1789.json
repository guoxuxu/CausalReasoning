  "Explanation": "Making it sunny through the 'increaseTemperature' does not specifically involve stopping the rain if it was already raining. 'startRain' can make it not sunny irrespective of temperature, but sunny weather achieved by temperature doesn't imply the rain must have been actively stopped; it could just have not been raining to begin with.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
