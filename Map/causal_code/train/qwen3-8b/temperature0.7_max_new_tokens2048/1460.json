  "Explanation": "A higher 'average' in the results could stem from a variety of input configurations: having exclusively larger numbers, a mix of high and moderate values, or even fewer but larger positive numbers compared to a previous dataset. Without additional specifics about the distribution and count of the input values, one cannot assert that larger numbers exclusively led to a higher 'average.'",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
