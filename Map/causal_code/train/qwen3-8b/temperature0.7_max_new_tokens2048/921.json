  "Explanation": "While 'isHeating' being false typically indicates that the system is not heating and potentially that the 'currentTemperature' is at least 'setTemperature', it does not definitively mean that 'currentTemperature' has reached 'setTemperature' because 'isHeating' could be initially false even if 'currentTemperature' is below 'setTemperature'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
