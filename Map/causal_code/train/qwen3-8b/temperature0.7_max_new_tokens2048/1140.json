  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(weather, holiday, discount): \n  if weather == 'sunny':\n    mood = 'happy'\n  else:\n    mood = 'normal'\n  if holiday:\n    free_time = 2\n  else:\n    free_time = 1\n  if discount:\n    spending_power = 1.5\n  else:\n    spending_power = 1\n  sales = (mood == 'happy') * free_time * spending_power\n  return sales\",\n\nIf the weather is sunny, will sales necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "While sunny weather influences mood to 'happy', which might increase sales, sales also depend on variables such as whether it's a holiday and if there is a discount ongoing. Without knowing these other conditions, an increase in sales isn’t guaranteed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
