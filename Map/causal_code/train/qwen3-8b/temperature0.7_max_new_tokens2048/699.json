  "Explanation": "An increase in humidity could result from changing the weather to 'rainy' or from activating heating on a snowy day. Hence, an increase in humidity does not specifically indicate a change to 'snowy' weather through intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
