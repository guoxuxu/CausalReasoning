  "Explanation": "Applying a discount decreases the product_price, which in case of a 'medium' interest level and price under 300 leads to 'average' sales_performance. However, the improvement from 'poor' to 'average' or maintaining 'average' depends on the specific combination of customer age, interest level, and the initial price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
