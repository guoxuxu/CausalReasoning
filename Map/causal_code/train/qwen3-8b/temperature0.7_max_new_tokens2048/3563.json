  "Problem": "Above Python Code\",\n\nGiven a decrease in carnivore population, was there a decrease in herbivore population without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The decrease in carnivore population is likely a result of insufficient herbivores to sustain them, indicating that herbivore populations might be the same or even less, not necessarily decreased by another factor directly impacting carnivores.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
