  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(weather, holiday, discount): \n  if weather == 'sunny':\n    mood = 'happy'\n  else:\n    mood = 'normal'\n  if holiday:\n    free_time = 2\n  else:\n    free_time = 1\n  if discount:\n    spending_power = 1.5\n  else:\n    spending_power = 1\n  sales = (mood == 'happy') * free_time * spending_power\n  return sales\",\n\nIf sales have increased, can we conclude the weather was sunny?",
  "Explanation": "Increased sales could be due to any combination of it being a holiday, the presence of a discount, or sunny weather. Without knowing the status of the other variables, an increase in sales cannot be specifically attributed to sunny weather.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
