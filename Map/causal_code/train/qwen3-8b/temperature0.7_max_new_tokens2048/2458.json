  "Explanation": "Directly setting the activity to 'Stay indoors' as an intervention removes the causal link between mood (and thus weather) and activity choice. In this scenario, even if the weather is good, the activity remains 'Stay indoors' due to the intervention, making mood and weather status uninformative about indoor activities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
