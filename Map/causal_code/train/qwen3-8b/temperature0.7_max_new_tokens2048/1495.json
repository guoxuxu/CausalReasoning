  "Explanation": "The function `decide_activity` maps 'sunny' weather to the activity 'picnic'. Consequently, 'picnic' as an activity in the function `choose_food` directly results in choosing 'sandwiches' as the food. Thus, there is a direct causal path from sunny weather to eating sandwiches without any intervention required.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
