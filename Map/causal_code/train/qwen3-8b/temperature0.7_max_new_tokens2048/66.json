  "Problem": "class Experiment {\n  int temperature;\n  int pressure;\n  boolean result;\n  public Experiment(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.2); // Assumes pressure is dependent on temperature\n    this.result = this.pressure > 100; // Result is true if pressure is greater than 100\n  }\n  public void setTemperature(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.1); // Changing the dependency formula here\n    this.result = this.pressure > 110; // Also changing the threshold for result\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the result is true, was the initial temperature necessarily above 83?",
  "Explanation": "Though it's likely to be true before intervention since 83 would theoretically give a pressure of 100 when multiplied by 1.2, the intervention through `setTemperature` changes the pressure formula and result condition, allowing potentially different combinations of temperature and pressures to achieve a 'true' result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
