  "Explanation": "The change from 'Medium' to 'High' likelihood of rain is more likely due to an increase in humidity levels crossing 85, not necessarily due to any alterations in temperature as the temperature condition specifically impacts the switch only below 20 degrees and does not generally involve a move from 'Medium' to 'High'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
