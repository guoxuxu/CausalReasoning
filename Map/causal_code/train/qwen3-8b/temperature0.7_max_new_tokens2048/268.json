  "Explanation": "When the alert level is set to 2, it generally indicates that it is raining, as the alert structure is designed to issue a moderate alert (level 2) only under rainy conditions without consideration of temperature, unless it's below zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
