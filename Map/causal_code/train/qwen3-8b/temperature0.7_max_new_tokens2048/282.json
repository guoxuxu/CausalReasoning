  "Problem": "Above Python code\",\n\nDoes an increase in internal temperature signify an increase in occupancy?",
  "Explanation": "Though higher occupancy can increase internal temperature, the reverse isn't necessarily true. An increase in internal temperature could also be due to other factors like a drop in external temperature. Causal directionality cannot be assumed reverse without evidence of only that variable affecting the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
