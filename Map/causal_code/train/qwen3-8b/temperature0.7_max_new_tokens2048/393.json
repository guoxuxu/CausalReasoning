  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data): \n    modified_data = input_data * 2 \n    final_data = modified_data + 10 \n    return final_data \n\nuser_input = 20 \nresult = process_data(user_input)\",\n\nIf user_input increases, will final_data also increase without any intervention in the process_data function?",
  "Explanation": "The function process_data is defined to multiply input_data by 2 and then add 10 to it. Therefore, any increase in user_input leads directly to an increase in final_data due to the multiplication, regardless of any other factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
