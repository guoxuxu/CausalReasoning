  "Explanation": "Even if `risk_factor` is set to a uniform value across all data as an intervention, this does not necessarily imply that `age` was uniform. The uniform `risk_factor` in this scenario is an imposed condition, independent of the actual distribution or modification of `age` values within the `clean` function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
