  "Explanation": "The base cost of a product, calculated in the superclass Product, depends only on the price and tax rate. Although applying a discount affects the final cost after computing the base cost, the calculation of base cost itself remains unaffected by the discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
