  "Explanation": "Decreasing the 'filter_threshold' allows more scores that are lower to be included in 'filtered_data'. Since the mean is calculated as the average of 'filtered_data', including more lower scores would likely decrease or maintain the current mean, not increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
