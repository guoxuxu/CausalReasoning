  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    if flag:\n        data['value'] *= 2\n    data['modified'] = True\n    if 'error' in data:\n        data['status'] = 'failed'\n    else:\n        data['status'] = 'successful'\n    return data\",\n\nWill setting the 'flag' to True and removing any 'error' key from the input data guarantee the 'status' of 'successful' in the output?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the 'flag' to True does not influence the 'status' directly; it only affects the 'value' field. However, if all 'error' keys are removed, irrespective of what 'flag' is set, the data block will not enter the 'if' condition that sets the 'status' to 'failed'. As a result, the data 'status' will be 'successful'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
