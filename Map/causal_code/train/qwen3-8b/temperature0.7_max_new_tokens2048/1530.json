  "Explanation": "Knowing that 'apply_filter' outputs zeros implies some values are below the threshold after normalization. One could alter the 'normalize' method to scale the data differently (e.g., higher scaling factor) or adjust the data prior to normalization to shift all values upwards, ensuring all normalized values surpass the threshold, thus eliminating zeros in 'processed_data'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
