  "Problem": "def compute_results(data):\n    a = 5\n    b = a + 3\n    def modify_b(x):\n        return x * 2\n    c = modify_b(b)\n    if c > 20:\n        result = 'High'\n    else:\n        result = 'Low'\n    return result\",\n\nIf the variable 'a' is increased, will the 'result' potentially change to 'High'?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'a' increases 'b' since 'b' is directly dependent on 'a'. Because 'modify_b' multiplies 'b', 'c' will also increase. If 'c' exceeds 20, the 'result' changes to 'High'. Hence, increasing 'a' without any intervention can lead 'result' to change to 'High'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
