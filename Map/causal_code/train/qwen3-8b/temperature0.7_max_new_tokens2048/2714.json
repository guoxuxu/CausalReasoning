  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, is_holiday):\n    if is_holiday:\n        discount = 0.15\n    else:\n        discount = 0.05\n\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the value of 'is_holiday' changes from False to True, does the final_price decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the 'is_holiday' from False to True increases the discount from 0.05 to 0.15. This higher discount rate decreases the final_price because the price is being reduced by a greater percentage.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
