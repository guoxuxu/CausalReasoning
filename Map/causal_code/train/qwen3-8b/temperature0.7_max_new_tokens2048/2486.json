  "Explanation": "Though processing does clear the orders on a non-holiday, the empty list alone isn't sufficient to conclude the day's holiday status without knowing whether orders were processed due to the system state, as the list might be empty for other reasons like not having received any orders.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
