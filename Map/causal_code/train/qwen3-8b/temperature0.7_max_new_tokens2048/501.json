  "Explanation": "In the original code, weather rating is determined directly by temperature and pressure. Specifically, if the temperature is above 20 degrees and the pressure is above 1010, the weather rating becomes 'good'. Thus, increasing the temperature alone above 20 degrees with appropriate pressure will improve the weather rating to 'good' without needing any other intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
