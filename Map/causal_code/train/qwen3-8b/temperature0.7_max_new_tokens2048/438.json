  "Explanation": "A higher final stock could result not only from more purchases but also from fewer sales or a higher starting inventory. Without specific information on sales or initial stock levels, we can't conclusively attribute high final stock to increased purchases alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
