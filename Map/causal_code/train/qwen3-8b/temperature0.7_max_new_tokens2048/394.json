  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data): \n    modified_data = input_data * 2 \n    final_data = modified_data + 10 \n    return final_data \n\nuser_input = 20 \nresult = process_data(user_input)\",\n\nIf final_data is observed to decrease, can we infer that user_input has definitely decreased without any changes to the process_data function?",
  "Explanation": "Since the function process_data linearly depends on the user_input (double the input, add 10), a decrease in final_data directly implies a decrease in user_input, provided that the process_data function remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
