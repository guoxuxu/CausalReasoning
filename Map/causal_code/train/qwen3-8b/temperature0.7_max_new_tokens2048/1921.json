  "Explanation": "According to the code, if a customer's purchase amount is greater than or equal to the discountThreshold, the discountActive flag is set to true. Subsequently, if discountActive is true, the purchase amount is discounted by 10%, reducing the final purchase amount the customer pays.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
