  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'temperature' in data:\n        temperature = data['temperature']\n        if temperature > 20:\n            mood = 'happy'\n        else:\n            mood = 'sad'\n    return mood\n\nresponse = process_data({'temperature': 25})\",\n\nIf the temperature is greater than 20 degrees, will mood definitely be 'happy'?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, if the temperature is greater than 20, the mood will be set to 'happy'. This decision is directly derived from the temperature value without any other intervening variables influencing the outcome in this segment of the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
