  "Problem": "function initPage() {\n\\tlet contentVisibility = false;\n\\tconst content = document.getElementById('special-content');\n\\tconst button = document.getElementById('toggle-button');\n\\tbutton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n\\t\\tcontentVisibility = !contentVisibility;\n\\t\\tcontent.style.display = contentVisibility ? 'block' : 'none';\n\\t});\n\\tsetTimeout(function() {\n\\t\\tcontent.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';\n\\t}, 5000);\n}\",\n\nIf the background color of 'special-content' is observed to be blue, can we deduce if an external script intervened to change the visibility?",
  "Explanation": "The change of the background color to blue is independent of the content's visibility state. Whether an external script intervened to change 'contentVisibility' or not cannot be deduced merely by observing the blue background color, as this change is scheduled unconditionally after 5 seconds.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
