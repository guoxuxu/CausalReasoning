  "Problem": "def compute_scores(data):\n    average = sum(data)/len(data)\n    adjustments = [x * 0.1 for x in data]\n    corrected_scores = [x + adjust for x, adjust in zip(data, adjustments)]\n    return corrected_scores, average\n\nscores = [65, 70, 75, 80]\nadjusted_scores, mean_score = compute_scores(scores)\",\n\nIf the 'mean_score' is found to be higher, can it be concluded that the 'scores' list had higher individual scores?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'mean_score' is the average of the 'scores', a higher 'mean_score' generally indicates higher values in the 'scores'. This is a direct causal relationship where the contents of the list determine the resulting average.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
