  "Problem": "Above Python code\",\n\nAssuming we observe an increase in internal temperature after manually increasing the heating output, does this suggest there are more people in the building?",
  "Explanation": "The observed increase in temperature after an intervention on the heating system does not imply an increase in occupancy. The correlation between internal temperature and occupancy is overridden by the fact that the temperature was increased by direct intervention on the heating system, making the rise independent of occupancy levels.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
