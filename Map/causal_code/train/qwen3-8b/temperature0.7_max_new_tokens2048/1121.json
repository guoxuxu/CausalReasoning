  "Explanation": "A higher number of conversions can be influenced by factors other than just the initial budget, such as the seasonality effect boosting the click rate, thereby increasing conversions even with a fixed budget. A high conversion number does not necessarily imply a higher budget.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
