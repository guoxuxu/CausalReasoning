  "Explanation": "While 'report_temperature' showing a higher temperature suggests that the temperature was increased, it's possible the initial temperature set in the constructor or other external modifications to the temperature attribute could also account for the higher reading. Thus, increase in temperature does not necessarily imply 'increase_temperature' was directly responsible.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
