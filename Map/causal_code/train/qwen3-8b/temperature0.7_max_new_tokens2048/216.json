  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    updated_data = data * 2\n    return updated_data\n\ndata = 5\nresult = process_data(data)\nif result > 10:\n    output = 'High'\nelse:\n    output = 'Low'\",\n\nIf you were to intervene and reset the 'output' to 'Low', would this imply that the 'result' was not greater than 10?",
  "Explanation": "Manually setting the 'output' to 'Low' suggests imposing a condition where the downstream effect (output) is determined regardless of the actual computation path. Ordinarily, 'output' being 'Low' directly implies 'result' would not be greater than 10, maintaining the logical consistency of the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
