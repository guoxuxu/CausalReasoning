  "Problem": "class VehicleSystem { constructor() { this.fuelLevel = 100; this.isEngineOn = false; this.speed = 0; } turnOnEngine() { if (this.fuelLevel > 0) { this.isEngineOn = true; this.speed = 10; } } drive() { if (this.isEngineOn) { this.fuelLevel -= 10; this.speed += 20; } } turnOffEngine() { this.isEngineOn = false; this.speed = 0; } checkFuelLevel() { return this.fuelLevel; } }\",\n\nIf 'speed' is more than 0, does that imply the engine is currently on?",
  "Explanation": "In the given code, the only way for 'speed' to be greater than 0 is if the engine has been turned on (via 'turnOnEngine') and possibly further increased by 'drive'. Speed is set to 0 when 'turnOffEngine' is called. This implies that a non-zero speed indicates an active engine.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
