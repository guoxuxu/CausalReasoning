  "Explanation": "The final price alone doesn't necessarily indicate the membership status because it is also influenced by the base price and the tax rate based on the location. Similarly priced items might result from different combinations of these factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
