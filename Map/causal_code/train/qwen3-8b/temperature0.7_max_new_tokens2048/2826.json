  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag): \n    result = [] \n    if flag: \n        for d in data: \n            if d % 2 == 0: \n                result.append(d ** 2) \n    else: \n        for d in data: \n            if d % 2 != 0: \n                result.append(d + 1) \n    return result\",\n\nIf 'flag' is set to True, will the function 'process_data' return a list of squared numbers for even integers?",
  "Explanation": "The function checks if 'flag' is True and then iterates through the list 'data'. For each element that is even (d % 2 == 0), it squares the number and appends it to 'result'. Thus, with 'flag' set to True, the function processes even integers by squaring them.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
