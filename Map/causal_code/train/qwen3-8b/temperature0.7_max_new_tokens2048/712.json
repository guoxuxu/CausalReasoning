  "Explanation": "The sale process checks if the inventory has sufficient stock to complete the sale. Reducing the initial stock without additional orders will still allow sales as long as there is enough inventory to meet the sale demand.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
