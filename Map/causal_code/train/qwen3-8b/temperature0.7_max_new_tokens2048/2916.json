  "Explanation": "Directly modifying the `subscribers` list by appending an email will effectively bypass the checking mechanism in `add_subscriber`, but `send_email` will still iterate over this list, including the manually added email.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
