  "Explanation": "The code dictates that both the heater and air conditioner will be off if the temperature is between 18 and 25 degrees inclusively. Even if an external intervention changes the heater state to on, the air conditioner state remains unaffected by this condition and will stay off according to the defined rules.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
