  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, increment, should_update): \n    if should_update: \n        for i in range(len(prices)): \n            prices[i] += increment \n    return prices\",\n\nIf prices remain unchanged, can we infer that the `increment` was set to zero?",
  "Explanation": "Unchanged prices can result either from `increment` being zero or `should_update` being false, preventing any changes to the prices. Thus, unchanged prices alone cannot definitively indicate that `increment` was set to zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
