  "Explanation": "Increased sales during a discount period cannot distinctly verify the absence of a holiday season, as discounts can be applied both during holidays and non-holidays. Higher sales could occur with either scenario.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
