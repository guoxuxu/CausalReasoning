  "Explanation": "The only mechanism for increasing money in this code is via the sale of items, as shown in the 'sell_item' method. If there’s an increment in the store’s money, it can be inferred that some items were indeed sold.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
