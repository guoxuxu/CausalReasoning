  "Explanation": "This examines the inference from the effect (total sales) to possible causes (price per unit, units sold) with intervention. The increase in total sales could result from a reduction in the discount rate or increase in units sold or price, so the effect does not pinpoint exactly which specific factor contributed without further specific interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
