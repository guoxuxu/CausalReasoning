  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    data['adjusted'] = data['original'] * 1.1 + 2\n    if data['adjusted'] > 20:\n        result = 'high'\n    else:\n        result = 'low'\n    return result\n\ninput_data = {'original': 15}\noutput = process_data(input_data)\",\n\nAssuming the result received is 'low', what can be inferred about the 'original' value if we can adjust the multiplier in the 'adjusted' computation?",
  "Explanation": "Since the multiplier in the adjusted computation has been labeled as adjustable but not specified or constrained, altering it allows multiple possibilities for the value of 'original'. 'Original' can be low or high depending on the chosen multiplier, making it impossible to infer its exact range just based on the outcome being 'low'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
