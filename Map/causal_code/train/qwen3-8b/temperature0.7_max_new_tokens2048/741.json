  "Explanation": "An increase in the tax_rate would actually increase the intermediate calculation of final_price (before discount is applied), which is qualitatively opposite to the effect observed (final_price being less than expected). Thus, a lesser final_price might more likely be the result of some other factor such as the base_price being lower or a high initial final_price triggering a discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
