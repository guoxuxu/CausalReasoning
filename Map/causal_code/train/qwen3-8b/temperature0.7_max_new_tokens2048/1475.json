  "Explanation": "Increasing the temperature could lead to a change in the weather status from 'rainy' to 'sunny' if the temperature originally was on the threshold and the humidity remains unchanged. This change in weather status directly affects the predicted activity from 'indoor activities' to 'picnic'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
