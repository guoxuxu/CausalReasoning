  "Explanation": "Increasing diet quality for user1, who already shows a 'high' activity level due to being under the age of 30 and actively engaged, will maintain or potentially lower their health risk as long as it remains above 7. According to the code logic, both high activity and a diet quality greater than 7 are required to maintain a 'low' health risk status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
