  "Explanation": "Since the intervention standardized the discounts to 15, knowing that the final_price is 85 provides no information on whether the original coupon code was 'SAVE10' or 'SAVE20'. The causal pathway from the original coupon code to the total price has been obscured by the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
