  "Explanation": "If a person's age is greater than 50, the score increases by 20 points. Additionally, if they also have experience, they receive an extra 10 points, indicating a definite increase in score due to age over 50.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
