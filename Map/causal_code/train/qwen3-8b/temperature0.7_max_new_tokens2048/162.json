  "Explanation": "An increased final_sales could be due to a high value of 'sales' itself, even if the growth factor is 1.0 (when 'sales' is not present). Thus, without knowing the initial 'sales' value or the exact growth factor applied, the exact reason for an increase in final_sales cannot solely be attributed to the presence of 'sales'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
