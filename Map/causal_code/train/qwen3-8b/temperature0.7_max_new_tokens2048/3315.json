  "Explanation": "While an increase in marketing campaign budget may indeed cause an increase in total sales, there are other independent variables such as economic conditions and seasonal effects that can also influence sales. Without information on these variables, it is not valid to attribute changes in total sales exclusively to changes in the marketing budget.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
