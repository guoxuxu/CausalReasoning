  "Problem": "Above Python Code\",\n\nIf the sunlight increases, would the herbivore population increase without any other changes?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing sunlight improves plant growth rates from 'low' to 'medium' or 'high', depending upon other conditions. This increase in plant growth rate results in increased food availability, thereby increasing the herbivore population.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
