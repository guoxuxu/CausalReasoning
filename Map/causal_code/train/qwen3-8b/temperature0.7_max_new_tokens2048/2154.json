  "Problem": "def update_users(active_users, transactions, year):\n    updated_users = set()\n    for user in active_users:\n        user_transactions = [t for t in transactions if t['user_id'] == user and t['year'] == year]\n        revenue = sum(t['amount'] for t in user_transactions)\n        if revenue > 5000:\n            updated_users.add(user)\n    return updated_users\",\n\nIf the set of updated_users is expanded after an intervention, can we conclude there was an increase in the number of high revenue transactions?",
  "Explanation": "Expanding updated_users through an intervention (such as adding more high revenue users to active_users) does not necessarily mean that these users had more or new transactions. This indicates potential growth in the user base rather than an increase in transaction activity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
