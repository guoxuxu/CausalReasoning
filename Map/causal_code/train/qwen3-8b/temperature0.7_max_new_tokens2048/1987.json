  "Explanation": "Directly intervening by setting the light to green (e.g., calling `toggle_traffic_light` when the light was red) before a car arrives ensures that the 'car_arrives' method will increase 'car_count', as per the conditional check in the method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
