  "Explanation": "Modifying the 'condition' to 'stable' through an intervention does not affect the 'medication_taken' variable as there is no feedback mechanism from 'condition' to 'medication_taken' in the code. Changes to the effect do not retroactively alter the cause, especially with intervention placed directly on the effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
