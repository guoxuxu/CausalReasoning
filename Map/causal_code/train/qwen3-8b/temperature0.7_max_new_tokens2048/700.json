  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data['value1'] + data['value2']\n    if x > 50:\n        status = 'High'\n    else:\n        status = 'Low'\n    y = x * 2\n    return {'x': x, 'status': status, 'y': y}\",\n\nIf the values of 'value1' and 'value2' are increased, will the value of 'status' potentially change?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'status' is determined based on whether the sum of 'value1' and 'value2' (x) is greater than 50. Increasing 'value1' and 'value2' will increase 'x' which could change the condition to either meet or not meet the >50 criteria, hence potentially changing 'status'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
