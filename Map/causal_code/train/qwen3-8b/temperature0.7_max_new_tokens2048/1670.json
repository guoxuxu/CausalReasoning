  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  modified_data = data * 2\n  if modified_data > 100:\n    output = True\n  else:\n    output = False\n  return output\n\ndef trigger_action(condition):\n  if condition:\n    response = 'Action Triggered'\n  else:\n    response = 'No Action'\n  return response\",\n\nIf input `data` always results in an output greater than 100 after processing, will `trigger_action` certainly produce 'Action Triggered'?",
  "Explanation": "From the code, it can be seen that whenever `process_data` outputs `True`, it implies the processed data was greater than 100. With `True` carried into `trigger_action`, the response from this function will definitely be 'Action Triggered'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
