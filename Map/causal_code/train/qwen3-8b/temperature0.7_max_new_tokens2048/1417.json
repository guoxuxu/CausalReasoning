  "Explanation": "According to the updateWeather method, rain will start if startRain is set to true and the temperature is below 20 degrees. Since both conditions are satisfied, it will certainly start raining.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
