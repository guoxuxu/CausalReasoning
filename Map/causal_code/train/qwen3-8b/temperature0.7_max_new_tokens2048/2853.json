  "Explanation": "An increase in average 'daily_sales' could be influenced by many factors, including increased 'base_sales', a higher average outcome from the seasonal variation, or changes in the 'marketing_impact'. We cannot conclusively determine the frequency of marketing strategy interventions solely from higher average sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
