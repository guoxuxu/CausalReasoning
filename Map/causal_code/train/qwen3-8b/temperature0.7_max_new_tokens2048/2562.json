  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  private int temperature;\n  private boolean isRaining;\n\n  public WeatherSimulator(int temperature, boolean isRaining) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.isRaining = isRaining;\n  }\n\n  public void setTemperature(int newTemp) {\n    temperature = newTemp;\n    if (temperature < 0) {\n      isRaining = false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public boolean getIsRaining() {\n    return isRaining;\n  }\n\n  public void causeStorm() {\n    if (temperature > 32) {\n      isRaining = true;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf it starts raining, can we infer that an external intervention set the temperature above 32 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "While the `causeStorm` method does require the temperature to be above 32 to start raining, rain can be enabled initially or by other stages of code not shown. Hence, we cannot deduce that an external intervention set the temperature high, as rain could also be part of the initial conditions set in the constructor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
