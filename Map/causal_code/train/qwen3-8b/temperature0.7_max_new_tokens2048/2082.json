  "Problem": "def process_data(raw_data):\n    modified_data = raw_data * 2\n    return modified_data\n\ndef analyze_data(data):\n    if data > 20:\n        result = 'High'\n    else:\n        result = 'Low'\n    return result\n\nraw_input = 10\nprocessed_input = process_data(raw_input)\nfinal_result = analyze_data(processed_input)\",\n\nIf you directly set processed_input to 25, will that warranty a final_result of 'High'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting processed_input to 25 directly influences the outcome of analyze_data. Since 25 is greater than 20, the analyze_data function always returns 'High' for any input greater than 20, thus directly resulting in a final_result of 'High'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
