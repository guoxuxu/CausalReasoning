  "Problem": "def update_score(age, score, training_completed): \n    if age > 18: \n        score += 10 \n    if training_completed: \n        score += 20 \n    return score\",\n\nIf we set the score to increase by 30 points apart from the given conditions, can we infer the person's age?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the score to increase arbitrarily by 30 points does not relate directly to a person's age or whether they have completed the training. These factors are independent of an arbitrary increase; hence a person’s age still cannot be inferred from this new score increase alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
