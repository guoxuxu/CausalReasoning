  "Explanation": "Changing the weather to 'good' would generally improve conditions, but solely attributing the increase in John's energy to the change in weather might be incorrect unless pollution levels were simultaneously addressed as his health issue was specifically tied to both factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
