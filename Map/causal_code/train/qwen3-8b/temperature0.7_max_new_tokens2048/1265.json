  "Explanation": "A higher final_price could result either from a higher base_price, a lower discount, or a higher tax_rate. Without specific details on discount or tax_rate changes, an increase in final_price alone doesn't necessarily imply an increase in base_price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
