  "Problem": "class WeatherSystem { constructor() { this.temperature = 20; this.humidity = 50; } increaseHeat(units) { this.temperature += units; if (this.temperature > 25) { this.humidity += 5; } } decreaseHumidity(percent) { this.humidity -= this.humidity * (percent / 100); if (this.humidity < 45) { this.temperature -= 3; } } }\",\n\nIf the humidity is observed to have decreased, can it be concluded that the temperature has been adjusted downward without other changes?",
  "Explanation": "In the decreaseHumidity method, lowering humidity directly does not always imply a decrease in temperature. However, if humidity drops below 45, it will lead to a reduction in temperature. Without knowing if the threshold was crossed, we cannot directly conclude a reduction in temperature from a decrease in humidity without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
