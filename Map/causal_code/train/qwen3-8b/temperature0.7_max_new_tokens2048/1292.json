  "Explanation": "A score of 80 can occur both at temperatures above or below 20 degrees Celsius, as long as it is not raining (mood is 'happy'). Thus, knowing just the score to be 80 isn't sufficient to determine if the temperature is necessarily above or below 20 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
