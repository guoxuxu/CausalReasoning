  "Problem": "def process_sales(data, discount_threshold, discount_rate, tax_rate):\n    total_sales = sum(data)\n    if total_sales > discount_threshold:\n        discount = total_sales * discount_rate\n        total_after_discount = total_sales - discount\n    else:\n        total_after_discount = total_sales\n    tax = total_after_discount * tax_rate\n    final_total = total_after_discount + tax\n    return final_total\",\n\nIf `final_total` shows an increase, can we assume `total_sales` have increased without looking at other variables?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in `final_total` could be due to several factors such as decrease in `discount_rate`, a higher `tax_rate`, or changes in the discount applicability (which is influenced by `discount_threshold`). Increased `total_sales` is just one possible reason.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
