  "Problem": "def compute_bonus(sales, quota):\n    if sales > quota:\n        return 0.1 * (sales - quota)\n    else:\n        return 0\n\ndef main():\n    sales = 15000\n    quota = 10000\n    bonus = compute_bonus(sales, quota)\n    print('Bonus for the employee:', bonus)\n\nmain()\",\n\nIf we set the 'quota' lower, will this systematically lead to a higher 'bonus' if sales remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "Lowering the quota while keeping sales constant reduces the threshold that sales need to exceed to generate a bonus, thus increasing the difference (sales - quota) and therefore increasing the resulting bonus.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
