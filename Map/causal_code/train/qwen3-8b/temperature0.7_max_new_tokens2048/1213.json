  "Problem": "def calculate_health_score(age, weight, activity_level, smoked): \n    base_score = 100 \n    age_penalty = (age - 30) / 2 if age > 30 else 0 \n    weight_penalty = (weight - 150) * 0.1 if weight > 150 else 0 \n    activity_bonus = 20 if activity_level == 'high' else (-20 if activity_level == 'low' else 0) \n    smoking_penalty = 50 if smoked else 0 \n    health_score = base_score - age_penalty - weight_penalty + activity_bonus - smoking_penalty \n    return health_score\",\n\nDid a person smoke if their health_score significantly decreases from their previous score?",
  "Explanation": "A significant decrease in health_score can be caused by multiple factors such as increases in age_penalty, weight_penalty, decrease in activity_bonus, as well as smoking. Without knowing the specific changes in other variables, we cannot definitively attribute the decrease to smoking alone. This evaluates the inference from effect to cause without intervention, which requires careful consideration due to multiple potential causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
