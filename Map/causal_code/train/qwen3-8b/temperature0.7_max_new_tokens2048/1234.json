  "Problem": "class TrafficSystem { constructor() { this.trafficLight = 'green'; this.carsMoving = true; } changeLight(color) { this.trafficLight = color; if (color === 'red') { this.carsMoving = false; } else { this.carsMoving = true; } } simulateAccident() { this.carsMoving = false; } getStatus() { return `Traffic Light: ${this.trafficLight}, Cars Moving: ${this.carsMoving}`; } } const cityTraffic = new TrafficSystem(); cityTraffic.changeLight('yellow'); cityTraffic.simulateAccident(); console.log(cityTraffic.getStatus());\",\n\nIf an external agent sets the traffic light to green, will the cars start moving?",
  "Explanation": "When the traffic light is set to green via the changeLight method, the carsMoving property is set to true, which directly causes the cars to start moving again, assuming no other interventions like simulateAccident are active.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
