  "Explanation": "By intervening and fixing the weather output of 'produce_weather' to 'cloudy', the 'decide_activity' function deterministically sets the activity to 'reading'. This intervention directly sets the cause, and we observe the corresponding effect in the activity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
