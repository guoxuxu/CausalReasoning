  "Explanation": "The decrease in external temperature will not definitely decrease the currentTemperature, because the system only lowers the currentTemperature if the external temperature falls below the targetTemperature, otherwise, it maintains the targetTemperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
