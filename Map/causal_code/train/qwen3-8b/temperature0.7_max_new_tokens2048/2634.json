  "Explanation": "Increasing the budget in the holiday season from 4000 to 6000 changes the marketing strategy from 'standard_campaign' to 'intensive_campaign'. Intensive campaigns have a higher effective sales performance in all economic conditions according to the code, leading to increased sales.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
