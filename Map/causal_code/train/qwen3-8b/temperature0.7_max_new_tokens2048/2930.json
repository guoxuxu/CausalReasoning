  "Explanation": "Increasing 'x' increases 'A' and subsequently 'B'. However, changes in 'B' affect 'C' differently depending on if 'B' crosses the threshold of 20. For instance, if 'B' was originally less than 20 and due to increase crosses over, 'C' might not increase proportional to the increase in 'B' due to the different ways 'C' is calculated. Since 'D' is 'C' minus 'A', the increase in 'A' can offset or exceed any increase in 'C'. Thus, 'D' might not necessarily be higher despite an increase in 'x'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
