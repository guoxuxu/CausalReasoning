  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private double temperature; public WeatherSimulator(double temp) { temperature = temp; } public void adjustTemperature(double delta) { temperature += delta; } public boolean willItRain() { return temperature < 20; } public double getTemperature() { return temperature; } }\",\n\nIf willItRain method returned true, can we infer that the initial temperature was set to less than 20?",
  "Explanation": "Given that willItRain returns true when the temperature is less than 20, observing true suggests that the temperature must indeed have been below 20 initially, assuming no other interventions on the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
