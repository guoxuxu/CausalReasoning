  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'age' in data and data['age'] > 18: \n        adult = True \n    else: \n        adult = False \n    if adult: \n        discount = 0.1 \n    else: \n        discount = 0.2 \n    final_price = data['price'] - data['price'] * discount \n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the 'age' key is missing from the data dictionary, will the discount be 20%?",
  "Explanation": "The code sets 'adult' to False if the 'age' key is missing or if the age is 18 or below, which in turn sets the discount to 20%.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
