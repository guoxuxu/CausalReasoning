  "Explanation": "An increased traffic delay can be caused by either a special event or heavy rain or both. Thus, observing that the traffic delay multiplier is greater than usual alone does not allow us to conclusively deduce the presence of a special event without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
