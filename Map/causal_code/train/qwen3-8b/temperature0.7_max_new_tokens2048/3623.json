  "Explanation": "The change in user balance and the application of discount rates are independent operations in the script. Increasing the balance does not imply any change in the discount rate systems. This question investigates the direction from effect (increased balance implying more items or more expensive items in the cart) to cause (alteration in discount rates), without actual causal linkage here.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
