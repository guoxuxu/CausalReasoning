  "Explanation": "While the `is_rainy()` returning True indicates that the current state has a temperature below 20°C and humidity above 80%, it does not guarantee that these values were set in the last update via `update_weather`. The values could have been set at initialization or adjusted by `adjust_for_season` if `is_rainy()` wasn't called immediately after `update_weather`. Thus, the relationship from effect to cause without intervention isn't conclusively determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
