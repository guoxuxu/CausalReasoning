  "Problem": "class Thermostat {\n  private int temperature;\n  private boolean power;\n\n  public Thermostat() {\n    temperature = 22; // Default room temperature in Celsius\n    power = false; // Thermostat is initially turned off\n  }\n\n  public void turnPowerOn() {\n    power = true;\n  }\n\n  public void turnPowerOff() {\n    power = false;\n  }\n\n  public void setTemperature(int newTemp) {\n    if (power) {\n      temperature = newTemp;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public boolean isPowerOn() {\n    return power;\n  }\n\n  public int getTemperature() {\n    return temperature;\n  }\n\n}\",\n\nIf the temperature reading changes, does this confirm that the setTemperature method was called?",
  "Explanation": "Although changing the temperature typically involves calling the setTemperature method, the temperature value itself could be initialized or altered without directly invoking this method (e.g., during object initialization or through some other method we might add in the future). Moreover, a change in temperature does not indicate the method's invocation unless it is confirmed that the thermostat's power was on.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
