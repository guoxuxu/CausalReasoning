  "Explanation": "While having fewer than 50 'processed_data' items would result in a lower accuracy, causing a non-deployment decision, there could still be more than 50 items with an accuracy of exactly 0.85, not exceeding the deployment threshold of 0.9, hence causing the decision to not deploy.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
