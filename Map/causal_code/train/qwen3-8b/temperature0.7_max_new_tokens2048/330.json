  "Explanation": "A lower 'final_price' could result from either having a 'premium' customer type or applying a coupon (or both). Since these factors are not mutually exclusive and can combine in various ways, a decrease in final price alone does not specifically indicate a 'premium' customer without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
