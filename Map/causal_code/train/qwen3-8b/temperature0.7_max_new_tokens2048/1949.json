  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n\\tfiltered_data = filter(lambda x: x['age'] > 30, data)\n\\tprocessed_data = [d for d in filtered_data if d['income'] > 50000]\n\\tfor item in processed_data:\n\\t\\tif item['education'] == 'College':\n\\t\\t\\titem['status'] = 'Approved'\n\\t\\telse:\n\\t\\t\\titem['status'] = 'Pending Review'\n\\treturn processed_data\",\n\nIf the list `data` changes, will the list `processed_data` necessarily change?",
  "Explanation": "Since `processed_data` is derived by filtering `data` based on certain conditions (age above 30 and income over 50000), any changes in `data` will potentially change `processed_data`. This is a direct causal relationship where changes in the cause (`data`) would impact the effect (`processed_data`).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
