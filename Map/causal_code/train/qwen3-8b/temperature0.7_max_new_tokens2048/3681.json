  "Explanation": "The lack of new alerts might not necessarily mean that the monitoring has stopped or that the variables are within normal ranges; it may also be due to not calling the check or adjustment methods, or the conditions for setting alerts are not being met even though the environment factors are abnormal.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
