  "Explanation": "In the method 'predict_precipitation', there's a condition that if the temperature is above 20 and humidity exceeds 65, it will cause precipitation (rain). Increasing the humidity in these temperature conditions can tip the balance over 65, leading to rain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
