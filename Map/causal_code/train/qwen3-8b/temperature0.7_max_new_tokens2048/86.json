  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'new_inventory' can be due to an increase in 'units_sold', a decrease in 'units_added', or even a decrease in the initial 'current_inventory'. Without additional information or holding other variables constant, we cannot determine the specific cause from the effect observed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
