  "Explanation": "From the code logic, when the temperature decreases after being set higher than 30, the decrease is exactly 5 degrees. Since the report shows 25 degrees and it is raining, the initial temperature must have been 35 or greater, triggering the rain condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
