  "Explanation": "According to the evaluate_health method, if the age is greater than 50, 10 points are deducted from the health score, thus aging past 50 directly decreases the health score.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
