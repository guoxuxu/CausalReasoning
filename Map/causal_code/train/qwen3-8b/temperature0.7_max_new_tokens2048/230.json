  "Problem": "`\nvar inputA = 10;\nvar inputB = 5;\nvar result = 0;\n\nfunction multiply(a, b) {\n  return a * b;\n}\n\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nfunction processInputs(a, b) {\n  var tempResult = multiply(a, b);\n  result = add(tempResult, a);\n  return result;\n}\n\nresult = processInputs(inputA, inputB);\nconsole.log(result);\n`,\n\nDoes a higher value of result necessarily mean inputA must have been high?",
  "Explanation": "A higher value of result could be due to either a high value of inputA, inputB, or both since the result depends on the multiplication of both inputA and inputB, followed by adding the value of inputA. It's the combination of both inputs that determines the high value of result, not just inputA alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
