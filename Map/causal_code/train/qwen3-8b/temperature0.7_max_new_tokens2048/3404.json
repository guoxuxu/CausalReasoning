  "Problem": "class UserAccount { constructor(balance) { this.balance = balance; } deposit(amount) { this.balance += amount; } withdraw(amount) { if (amount <= this.balance) { this.balance -= amount; return true; } else { return false; } } getBalance() { return this.balance; } } const user = new UserAccount(1000); user.deposit(500); const successfulWithdrawal = user.withdraw(1200); const remainingBalance = user.getBalance();\",\n\nIf an additional amount was added before checking the balance, would the balance be higher than if no deposit was made?",
  "Explanation": "Considering an intervention by calling the deposit method (e.g., user.deposit(300)) before calling getBalance, this extra deposit would directly increase the balance in addition to any previous balance. Thus, if this deposit happens compared to when it doesn’t, the balance will indeed be higher.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
