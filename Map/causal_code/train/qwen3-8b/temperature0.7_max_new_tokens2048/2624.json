  "Explanation": "Manually setting `systemReady` to true makes the system 'ready'. Thus, calling `addTasks` later will effectively add the number of tasks specified by `newTasks` to `taskCount`, as the condition in `addTasks` checks if the system is ready.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
