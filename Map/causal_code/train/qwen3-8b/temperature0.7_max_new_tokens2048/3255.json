  "Explanation": "While an external temperature below 20 will decrease the body temperature and could potentially make 'cold' true, 'cold' being true could also be caused by a high body temperature returning to a normal range below 36 due to other interactions not related directly to external temperature (like medication effects or overcoming sickness), hence we cannot infer exclusively from 'cold' to a specific external temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
