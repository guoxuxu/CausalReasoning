  "Explanation": "If there was a manual intervention altering the device status, the direct causal link between the temperature and the heating status is disrupted. The heating 'on' status may no longer faithfully represent the ambient temperature conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
