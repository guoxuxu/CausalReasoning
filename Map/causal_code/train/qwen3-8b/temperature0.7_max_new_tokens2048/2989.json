  "Explanation": "With intervention (knowing there was advertising), if sales still dropped, it suggests the weather was unfavorable (likely rainy or cloudy), as advertising generally boosts sales effectively under sunny or cloudy conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
