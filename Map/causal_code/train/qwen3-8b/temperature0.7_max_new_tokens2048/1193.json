  "Problem": "def compute_salary(base_salary, performance_rating, years_of_experience): \n\\tbonus_percentage = 0.05 * performance_rating \n\\tbonus = base_salary * bonus_percentage \n\\tif years_of_experience > 5: \n\\t\\tbonus += 1000 \n\\treturn base_salary + bonus\",\n\nIf the total calculated salary is observed to increase, can we conclude that the performance rating has necessarily increased?",
  "Explanation": "The increase in total salary could also be due to an increase in the base salary or because the years of experience surpassed 5, triggering the additional $1000 to the bonus. Therefore, we cannot conclusively assert that an increase in salary was due to an increase in performance rating alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
