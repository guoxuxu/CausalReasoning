  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data:\n        data['is_adult'] = data['age'] > 18\n    if data.get('income', 0) > 30000:\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'high'\n    else:\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'low'\n    return data\",\n\nIf the `age` in the input data changes from 20 to 30, will the `is_adult` flag change as well?",
  "Explanation": "The `is_adult` flag is determined based on whether age is greater than 18. Changing the age from 20 to 30, although modifies the age, does not alter the Boolean output of `age > 18` because both 20 and 30 satisfy this condition. Hence, the `is_adult` flag remains True irrespective of this change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
