  "Explanation": "While an increase in `external_temp` does contribute to an increase in `temperature`, there are other independent mechanisms inside the code which might increase the `temperature` such as the heater turning on automatically when the `temperature` is below 20. Therefore, an increase in `temperature` cannot conclusively imply that `external_temp` has increased without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
