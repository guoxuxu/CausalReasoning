  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data['value'] + 2\n    y = x * 3\n    if y > 20:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    z = y - 5\n    return {'result': result, 'z': z}\",\n\nIf we set 'x' to 10 in the code during execution, will the output 'result' be True?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'x' to 10 in the code results in 'y' being set to 30 (as 'y' = 3 * 10). Since 30 is greater than 20, this ensures the condition for 'result' = True is met, demonstrating a direct intervention effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
