  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    modified_data = data * 2 \n    final_data = modified_data + 100 \n    return final_data\n\nresult = process_data(50)\",\n\nIf external code changes 'modified_data' to always be 100 regardless of input before it's added with 100, will 'final_data' always be 200?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by fixing 'modified_data' at 100 means 'final_data' becomes a simple sum of 100 + 100, which is always 200, irrespective of the input to 'process_data'. This intervention creates a direct causal link between the intervention and the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
