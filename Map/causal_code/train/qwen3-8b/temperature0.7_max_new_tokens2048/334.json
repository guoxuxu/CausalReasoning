  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n    int temperature = 20;\n    boolean isRaining = false;\n\n    void setTemperature(int newTemp) {\n        temperature = newTemp;\n        if (temperature < 5) {\n            isRaining = true;\n        }\n    }\n\n    void makeItRain() {\n        isRaining = true;\n        if (isRaining) {\n            temperature -= 5;\n        }\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf it is observed to be raining, can we infer the temperature dropped below 5 without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Rain can be caused either by the temperature dropping below 5 or by calling the makeItRain method, which forcefully changes isRaining to true and alters temperature as a consequence. Therefore, rain itself does not imply that the temperature dropped below 5 without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
