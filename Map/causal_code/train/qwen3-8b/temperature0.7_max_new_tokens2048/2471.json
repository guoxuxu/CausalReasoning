  "Problem": "def weather_effect(day):\n  if day == 'sunny':\n    mood = 'happy'\n    productivity = 'high'\n  elif day == 'rainy':\n    mood = 'sad'\n    productivity = 'low'\n  else:\n    mood = 'neutral'\n    productivity = 'medium'\n  return mood, productivity\n\nweather = 'sunny'\nmood, productivity = weather_effect(weather)\",\n\nIf the weather is sunny, is the productivity expected to be high?",
  "Explanation": "In the provided code, the function 'weather_effect' defines that if the day is 'sunny', both mood will be 'happy' and productivity will be 'high'. Therefore, with a sunny day as the cause, high productivity is a direct effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
