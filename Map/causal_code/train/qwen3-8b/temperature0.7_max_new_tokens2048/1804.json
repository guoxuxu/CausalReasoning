  "Explanation": "The reset method itself doesn’t manipulate external temperatures or their thresholds against which temperatures are checked. It only resets the internal states to their default values. No change in is_heating_on after reset does not necessarily mean external temperatures haven’t dropped below the threshold; it only indicates that update_temperature hasn’t yet been called or external conditions didn’t initiate heating.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
