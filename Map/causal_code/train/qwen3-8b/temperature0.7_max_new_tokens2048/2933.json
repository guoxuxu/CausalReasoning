  "Problem": "def compute_values(x, increment_by=1):\n  A = x * 2\n  B = A + increment_by\n  if B > 20:\n    C = B * 2\n  else:\n    C = B + 10\n  D = C - A\n  return D\",\n\nIf we observe a decrease in 'D', can we infer that 'increment_by' was decreased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'D' can result from various factors. While decreasing 'increment_by' decreases 'B' and consequently could decrease 'C', the change in 'D' could also be because of a decrease in 'x' leading to a lower 'A', which doesn't influence 'B' through 'increment_by'. Hence, 'D' decreasing does not specifically allow us to infer that 'increment_by' was decreased given the multiple pathways impacting 'D'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
