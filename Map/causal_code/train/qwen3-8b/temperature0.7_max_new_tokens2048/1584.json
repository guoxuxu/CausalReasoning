  "Explanation": "A decrease in the outcome of final_price() can suggest that a discount was applied. Since the discount directly decreases the base_price, which is used in calculating the final price, observing a decrease in final_price() allows the inference that a discount might have been applied, showing causal inference from effect back to presumed cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
