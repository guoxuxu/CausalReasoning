  "Problem": "Provided Python Snippet Above\",\n\nIf the risk score is observed to be 50, can we infer the person has a precondition?",
  "Explanation": "A score of 50 can be achieved simply from being over 50 years of age. A precondition is not the only cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
