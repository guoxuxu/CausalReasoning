  "Explanation": "The condition 'Sunny' is determined explicitly by both temperature being greater than 20 and humidity being 0.7 or below. Thus, if it is 'Sunny', the temperature must be greater than 20 regardless of the humidity level.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
