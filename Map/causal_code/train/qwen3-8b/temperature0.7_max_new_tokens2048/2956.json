  "Explanation": "Injecting an additional budget into a moderate market condition, which potentially increases the total marketing budget to 100000 (50000 original plus 50000 intervention), still keeps the sales performance at 'Good' according to the sales_performance function. The function's logic doesn't shift directly to 'Excellent' without high market growth.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
