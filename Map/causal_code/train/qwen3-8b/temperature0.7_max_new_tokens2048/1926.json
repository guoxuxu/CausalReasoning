  "Explanation": "Low performance is derived when systemLoad is greater than 50. Although enabling debugMode can increase the load, low performance might also be due to high systemLoad from other factors unrelated to debugMode. Thus, low performance does not necessarily imply that debugMode was set to true, indicating a non-exclusive causal relationship when deducing from effect to cause without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
