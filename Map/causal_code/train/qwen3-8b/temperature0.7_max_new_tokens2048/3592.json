  "Explanation": "Improving the diet quality affects John's health status directly. When the diet quality increases from 6 to 8 while the pollution is above 50, his health status improves from 'Poor' to 'Fair' according to the logic in update_health_status_based_on_environment method.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
