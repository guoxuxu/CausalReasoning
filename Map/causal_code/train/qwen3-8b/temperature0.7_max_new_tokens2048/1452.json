  "Problem": "def update_temperature(weather_data, action):\n    temperature = weather_data['temperature']\n    if action == 'increase':\n        temperature += 3\n    elif action == 'decrease':\n        temperature -= 5\n    return temperature\n\n# Example usage\ncurrent_weather = {'temperature': 20}\nnew_temperature = update_temperature(current_weather, 'increase')\",\n\nCan the decrease in temperature indicate which action was taken?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in temperature doesn’t necessarily indicate that the 'decrease' action was chosen; the environmental temperature might have naturally changed due to factors that are not considered in the function, or the action could still be 'increase' but other factors not reflected in this function could have lowered the temperature more significantly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
