  "Explanation": "By setting the target temperature below the current temperature, the condition in the 'regulate_temperature' method will fall into the else branch where the cooler gets turned on, hence changing the effect (cooler turning on) by intervening in the cause (target temperature).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
