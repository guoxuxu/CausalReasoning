  "Explanation": "Poor sales performance could occur not only from low market conditions but also from moderate market conditions with a lower than required budget. Hence, observing poor performance alone cannot conclusively determine the market condition was low, as market condition 'Moderate' with less than 80000 budget (which is possible) can also result in 'Poor' performance.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
