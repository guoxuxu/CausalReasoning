  "Problem": "def update_data(data, factor, mode='replace'): \n  if mode == 'replace':\n    return {k: v * factor for k, v in data.items()}\n  elif mode == 'incremental':\n    return {k: v + factor for k, v in data.items()}\n\ndata = {'A': 5, 'B': 10}\nupdated_data = update_data(data, 2)\ndata_effect = update_data(data, 10, 'incremental')\",\n\nIf we enforce the mode to 'replace', will increasing the factor always yield a direct proportional increase in the output values?",
  "Explanation": "Setting mode to 'replace' changes the behavior of the function to multiply each value by the factor. Therefore, an increase in the factor directly and proportionally increases each output value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
