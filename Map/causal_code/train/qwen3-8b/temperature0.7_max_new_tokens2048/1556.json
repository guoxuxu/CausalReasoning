  "Problem": "def compute_health_risk(age, smoker, bmi): \n    risk = 0 \n    if age > 50: \n        risk += 20 \n    if smoker: \n        risk += 30 \n    if bmi > 25: \n       risk += 10 \n    return risk\",\n\nIf the health risk score is high, can we conclude the person is over 50?",
  "Explanation": "A high health risk score could also be due to being a smoker or having a high BMI. Since these factors add to the risk independently, a high risk score does not necessarily mean the person is over 50.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
