  "Explanation": "The code explicitly sets the user's status to 'online' only when a 'login' action is performed. Thus, if a user's status is 'online', it can be inferred from the code that the user performed a login action.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
