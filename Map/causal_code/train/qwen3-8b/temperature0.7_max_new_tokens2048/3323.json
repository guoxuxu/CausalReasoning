  "Explanation": "The weather status 'Rainy and cold' comes only under the condition that 'isRaining' is true, which is set only when the 'updateWeather' method receives the 'rain' flag as true. Additionally, the 'Rainy and cold' status implies a temperature reduction potentially due to being less than 10 degrees initially.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
