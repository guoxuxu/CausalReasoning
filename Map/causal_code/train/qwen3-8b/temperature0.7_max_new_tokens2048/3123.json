  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data):\n    if 'sales' in data and 'expenses' in data:\n        profit = sum(data['sales']) - sum(data['expenses'])\n        if profit > 1000:\n            performance = 'good'\n        elif profit > 0:\n            performance = 'average'\n        else:\n            performance = 'poor'\n        return profit, performance\n    else:\n        return None, 'incomplete data'\",\n\nIf 'performance' is 'good', can it be concluded that 'expenses' were necessarily low?",
  "Explanation": "The 'good' performance is determined by the 'profit' being over 1000. This could occur both by having high sales, low expenses, or a combination of moderately high sales and moderate expenses. Thus, low expenses are not a necessary condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
