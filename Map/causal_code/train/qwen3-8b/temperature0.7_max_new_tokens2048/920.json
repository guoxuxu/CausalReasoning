  "Explanation": "In the 'updateTemperature' method, there is a condition that checks if 'currentTemperature' is less than 'setTemperature'. If they are equal, it does not satisfy the condition, hence 'isHeating' remains false or is set to false.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
