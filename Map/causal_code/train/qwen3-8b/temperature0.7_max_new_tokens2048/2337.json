  "Explanation": "The function `adjust_age` increases the student's age and conditionally increases their attendance by 2 if they are an honors student, demonstrating a causal effect of the intervention (age adjustment) on attendance for honors students.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
