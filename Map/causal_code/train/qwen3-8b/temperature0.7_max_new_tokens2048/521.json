  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  int temperature;\n  bool isRaining;\n\n  WeatherSimulator(int temp, bool rain) {\n    temperature = temp;\n    isRaining = rain;\n  }\n\n  void updateWeather(int newTemp, bool newRain) {\n    temperature = newTemp;\n    isRaining = newRain;\n  }\n\n  bool checkSnowLikelihood() {\n    if (temperature < 0 && isRaining) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the temperature decreases, will the likelihood of snow increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the checkSnowLikelihood method, snow is more likely if the temperature is below 0 and it is raining. Lowering the temperature increases the chances of it being below zero, thereby potentially increasing the likelihood of snow.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
