  "Explanation": "The 'check_temp' method sets the heater off only when the current_temp is not less than the desired_temp. Therefore, if the heater is off, it presupposes either the attainment or exceeding of the desired_temp. This analysis accounts for the controller's logic as described in the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
