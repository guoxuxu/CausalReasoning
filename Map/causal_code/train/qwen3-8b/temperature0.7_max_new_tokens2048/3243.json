  "Problem": "def process_data(data, factor, offset): \n\\tadjusted_data = [x * factor for x in data] \n\\tfinal_data = [y + offset for y in adjusted_data] \n\\treturn final_data \n\nresult = process_data([1, 2, 3], 2, 5)\",\n\nIf the values in 'final_data' are observed to be decreasing, can we conclude that 'factor' was reduced, assuming 'offset' is unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Several reasons could lead to a decrease in 'final_data', not exclusively a reduction in 'factor'. The original elements in 'data' could be smaller or negative, or 'offset' could have been changed. Without controlling other variables, we cannot confirm the cause solely based on the reduction in 'final_data'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
