  "Explanation": "Seeing the currentHumidity reduction alone does not imply that the targetHumidity was lowered. The reduction could be a result of a change in externalHumidity that set the currentHumidity to equal the lower externalHumidity when it is below the target.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
