  "Explanation": "The log entry appending is a result of the user's action and does not influence or change the action itself. The action (login or logout) occurs before the log entry is appended, indicating a unidirectional relationship from user action to logging.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
