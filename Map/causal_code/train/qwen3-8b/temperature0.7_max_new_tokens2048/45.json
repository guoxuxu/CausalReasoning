  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(balance, rate): \n    interest = balance * rate / 100 \n    return interest \n\nbalance = 5000 \nrate = 5 \ninterest = calculate_interest(balance, rate) \nbalance += interest\",\n\nIf the rate increases, will the interest increase?",
  "Explanation": "The function `calculate_interest` directly multiplies the `balance` with the `rate` to calculate the `interest`. Therefore, when the `rate` increases, the `interest` calculated from the balance will proportionally increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
