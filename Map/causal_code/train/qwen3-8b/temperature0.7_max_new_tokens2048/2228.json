  "Explanation": "The decision to exercise is influenced by the health status, which depends on both age and diet_quality, but without knowledge of diet quality, age cannot be inferred from exercise decision alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
