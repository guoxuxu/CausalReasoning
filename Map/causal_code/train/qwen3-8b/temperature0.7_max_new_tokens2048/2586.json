  "Explanation": "Lowering the heart rate through the 'recover' method involves time elapsed ('minutes' parameter), but since the 'recover' only lowers the heart rate to a minimum of 60, other factors can also set the heart rate to this lower range, such as natural resting state. Thus, a direct inference about recovery or exercise intensity based on heart rate is not reliable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
