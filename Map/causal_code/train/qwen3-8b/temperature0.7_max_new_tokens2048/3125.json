  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data):\n    if 'sales' in data and 'expenses' in data:\n        profit = sum(data['sales']) - sum(data['expenses'])\n        if profit > 1000:\n            performance = 'good'\n        elif profit > 0:\n            performance = 'average'\n        else:\n            performance = 'poor'\n        return profit, performance\n    else:\n        return None, 'incomplete data'\",\n\nBy observing a 'poor' performance, can we intervene on 'sales' to determine it was low?",
  "Explanation": "A 'poor' performance indicates that 'profit' was zero or negative. This could be due to low sales, high expenses, or both. Intervening on 'sales' to make it low doesn't conclusively show that it was not already low; it could also have been due to unexpectedly high expenses.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
