  "Problem": "def weather_effect(temperature): \n    if temperature > 20:\n        mood = 'happy'\n    else:\n        mood = 'sad'\n    if mood == 'happy' and temperature > 25:\n        productivity = 'high'\n    elif mood == 'sad' or temperature <= 25:\n        productivity = 'low'\n    return productivity\n\",\n\nIf the temperature rises above 20 degrees without any other changes, does the productivity increase?",
  "Explanation": "Simply crossing the 20 degrees mark improves mood from 'sad' to 'happy', but productivity remains 'low' unless the temperature exceeds 25 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
