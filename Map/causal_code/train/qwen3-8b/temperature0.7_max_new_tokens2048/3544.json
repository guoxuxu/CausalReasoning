  "Explanation": "Changing user2’s active status to True modifies their activity level from 'low' to 'moderate', as shown in the `activity_level` method for ages >=30. This is an intervention pushing the causal factor (active status, which determines activity level) directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
