  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(prices, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        discount_rate = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount_rate = 0.05\n    discounted_prices = [price * (1 - discount_rate) for price in prices]\n    return discounted_prices\",\n\nDoes observing lower discounted prices necessarily imply it is currently summer?",
  "Explanation": "Lower discounted prices may result from either it being summer or from original prices being lower. Since the season is not the only factor affecting the discounted prices, observing lower prices alone does not imply it is summer.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
