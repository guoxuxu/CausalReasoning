  "Explanation": "The method apply_discount reduces the sales prices by a given percentage. Therefore, if the quantity sold remains constant, the reduction in prices leads to lower total revenue.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
