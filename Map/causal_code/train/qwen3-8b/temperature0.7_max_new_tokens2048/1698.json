  "Explanation": "Stress level reduction might be influenced by interventions like reducing work hours, but without knowing more about the program or other potential interventions (such as relaxation techniques not shown in the code), a decrease in stress does not confirm that work hours were specifically reduced below 5.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
