  "Explanation": "A drop in temperature in the system can occur either by the window being opened or by the heater being turned off without intervention. Therefore, observing just the temperature drop does not definitively indicate that the window was specifically opened without considering the status of the heater.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
