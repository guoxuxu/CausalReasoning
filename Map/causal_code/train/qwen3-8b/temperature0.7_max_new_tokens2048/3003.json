It includes a variable for the oven's functionality, which can be disrupted, affecting the baking process.\",\n    \"Code\": \"\"\"\ndef bake_cake(ingredients, oven_working):\n    if 'flour' in ingredients and 'eggs' in ingredients and oven_working:\n        cake = 'baked'\n    else:\n        cake = 'not baked'\n    return cake\n\noven_status = True\ningredients = ['flour', 'eggs', 'sugar']\ncake_status = bake_cake(ingredients, oven_status)\n\nprint('Cake status:', cake_status)\n\"\"\"\n  },\n\nDoes the presence of a baked cake always indicate that the oven was working?",
  "Explanation": "The cake can only be baked ('baked' status) if the oven is working. Hence, if the cake is baked, it directly indicates the functionality of the oven.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
