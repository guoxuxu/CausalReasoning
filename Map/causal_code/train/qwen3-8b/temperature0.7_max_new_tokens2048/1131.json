  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    cleaned_data = clean(data)\n    validated_data = validate(cleaned_data)\n    results = analyze(validated_data)\n    return results\n\n def clean(data):\n    # Remove invalid entries\n    return [d for d in data if d['value'] > 0]\n\n def validate(data):\n    # Check data integrity\n    return [d for d in data if 'value' in d]\n\n def analyze(data):\n    # Analyze the data and produce results\n    average = sum(d['value'] for d in data) / len(data)\n    return {'average_value': average}\",\n\nIf someone externally modified the output of 'validate' before it reaches 'analyze', would it change the result of 'analyze'?",
  "Explanation": "An external modification of the output from 'validate' directly affects the dataset that 'analyze' processes. Since 'analyze' computes the average based on the input data, any alteration to this input data necessarily impacts the resulting average. This constitutes a direct causal impact from an intervention on the validator results to the final analysis outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
