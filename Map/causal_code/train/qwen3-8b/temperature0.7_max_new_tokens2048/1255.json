  "Problem": "def calculate_health(age, smoking_status, exercise_freq):\n    base_health = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health -= (age - 50) * 0.5\n    if smoking_status:\n        base_health -= 20\n    if exercise_freq >= 3:\n        base_health += 15\n    return base_health\",\n\nIf we see an increase of 15 points in health, can we deduce that the person has started exercising frequently?",
  "Explanation": "While exercising frequently does increase health by 15, the code does not guarantee that this is the only way for health to increase by this amount. Other factors could be adjusted, like reducing smoking or other interventions not shown in the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
