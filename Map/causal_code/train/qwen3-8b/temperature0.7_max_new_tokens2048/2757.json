  "Problem": "def sales_forecast(hours_worked, ad_budget): \n  productivity = hours_worked * 0.5\n  ad_effectiveness = ad_budget * 0.3\n  total_sales = (productivity + ad_effectiveness) * 1000 \n  return total_sales\",\n\nKnowing the total sales, can we uniquely determine the hours worked if we fix the advertising budget?",
  "Explanation": "Even with a fixed advertising budget making ad_effectiveness constant, the total sales result from the sum of productivity and a constant. Multiple combinations of hours worked could result in the same total sales figure due to this summation relationship, making it impossible to uniquely determine hours worked based solely on total sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
