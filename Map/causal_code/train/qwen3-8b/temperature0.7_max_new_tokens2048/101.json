  "Explanation": "According to the code, increasing the temperature leads to a change in the weather status directly based on the update_weather method's check (>30 is 'Sunny'). There are no other dependencies in the method that can alter this outcome, thus increasing the temperature to 35 will change the weather status to 'Sunny'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
