  "Problem": "def analyze_data(data):\n    height = data['height']\n    age = data['age']\n    weight = age * 2 + 10\n    if height > 170:\n        fitness = 'high'\n    else:\n        fitness = 'low'\n    return {'weight': weight, 'fitness': fitness}\",\n\nIf an adjustment is made to label fitness as 'low', can this result in a change in the height data?",
  "Explanation": "In the given code, fitness is a direct result of height. Adjusting the fitness label to 'low' does not cause a reciprocal change in height, as the relationship is unidirectional from height to fitness.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
