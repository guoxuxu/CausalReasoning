  "Problem": "def analyze_data(data):\n    if 'sales' in data and 'expenses' in data:\n        profit = data['sales'] - data['expenses']\n        if profit > 50000:\n            data['profitable'] = True\n        else:\n            data['profitable'] = False\n    if 'profitable' in data and data['profitable']:\n        data['invest_more'] = True\n    else:\n        data['invest_more'] = False\n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'sales' value increases, will the 'profitable' flag likely be affected without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "In the original code, the 'profitable' flag directly depends on the value of 'sales' minus 'expenses'. Thus, increasing 'sales' would increase the 'profit' and hence increases the chances for the 'profitable' flag to be True.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
