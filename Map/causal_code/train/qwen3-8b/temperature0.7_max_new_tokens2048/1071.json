  "Explanation": "An increase in 'd' through intervention could have been achieved by manipulating any one (or more) of 'a', 'b', or 'x'. Specifically, since 'd = c * x' if 'x' is positive, increasing 'a' or 'b' would increase 'c' and, hence, 'd'. Additionally, manipulating 'x' to a higher positive value would also increase 'd'. Therefore, just knowing 'd' increased does not specify which variable the intervention was applied to without further information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
