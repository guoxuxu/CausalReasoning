  "Problem": "class ClimateControlSystem: def __init__(self, temperature): self.temperature = temperature def heat(self, increase): self.temperature += increase if self.temperature > 30: self.temperature = 30 def cool(self, decrease): self.temperature -= decrease if self.temperature < 15: self.temperature = 15 def check_temp(self): return 'Warm' if self.temperature > 25 else 'Cold'\",\n\nIf the 'heat' method is called with an increase value that takes the temperature above 30, will the temperature always stay at 30?",
  "Explanation": "The 'heat' method in the code includes a conditional check that sets the temperature to 30 if it exceeds 30 after applying the increase. Therefore, no matter how much the increase exceeds 30, the maximum temperature is capped at 30.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
