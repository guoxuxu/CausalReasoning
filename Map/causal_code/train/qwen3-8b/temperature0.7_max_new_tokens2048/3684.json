  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  adjusted_data = data ** 2\n  result = adjusted_data * 5\n  return result\n\nvalue = 10\nprocessed_value = process_data(value)\nprint(processed_value)\",\n\nIf a new step in 'process_data' multiplies 'adjusted_data' by a constant different from 5, will the relationship between 'value' and 'processed_value' remain the same?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing a change in the scaling factor inside 'process_data' directly affects how 'processed_value' is computed from 'value'. Altering this factor changes the relationship by modifying how much the squared 'value' is scaled before being returned, thus changing the output for any given input.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
