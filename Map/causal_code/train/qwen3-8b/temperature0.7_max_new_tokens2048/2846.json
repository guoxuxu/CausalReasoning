  "Explanation": "In the 'update_temperature' method, keeping the heater on increments the current_temp by 1 every time it is called. This will continue until 'check_temp' potentially turns the heater off but, without external intervention, the temperature will continue to rise as long as the heater is on.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
