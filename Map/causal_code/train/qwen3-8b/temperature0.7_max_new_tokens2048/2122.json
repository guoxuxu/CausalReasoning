  "Explanation": "The intervention of editing the 'status' to exclude 'error' implies that prior to the intervention, 'status' had 'error', as this is the only condition under which 'corrected' would have initially been set to False. Given 'corrected' has changed to True following a change in 'status', it suggests the causal link from the change (effect) back to the original status (cause).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
