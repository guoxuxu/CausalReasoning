  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    adjusted_data = data * 2\n    if adjusted_data > 20:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    return result\n\nuser_input = 15\noutput = process_data(user_input)\",\n\nIf you change the code to multiply the user_input by 3 instead of 2, will this increase the likelihood that 'process_data' returns True?",
  "Explanation": "Multiplying 'user_input' by a larger factor increases 'adjusted_data' more significantly for the same 'user_input'. This makes it easier for the condition 'adjusted_data > 20' to be met, therefore increasing the likelihood of the function returning True.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
