  "Explanation": "The function 'cleanse_data' deals with missing ages by filling them with the mean age. By modifying this intervention to fill with a specific value above 30, it increases the overall mean age, hence the classification in 'analyze' would more likely be 'Adult'. This is a clear case of manipulating a cause and observing its effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
