  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    normalized_data = (data - data.mean()) / data.std()\n    threshold = normalized_data.mean() + 1.5 * normalized_data.std()\n    important_data = normalized_data[normalized_data > threshold]\n    return important_data.sum()\n\ndata = np.array([10, 12, 15, 20, 22, 30])\nresult = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf the standard deviation of the data array increases, will the result from process_data remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the standard deviation will affect the normalization process (by decreasing the scaling factor in the denominator), and subsequently affect how many data points exceed the threshold. Therefore, the sum of 'important_data' is likely to change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
