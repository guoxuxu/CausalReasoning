  "Explanation": "An increase in humidity, assuming that it surpasses the 80% threshold necessary for cloud formation, indirectly increases the likelihood of rain by facilitating cloud formation, assuming temperature is already within the required range to support cloud formation and subsequent rain fall.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
