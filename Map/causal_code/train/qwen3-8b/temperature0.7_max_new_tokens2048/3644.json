  "Problem": "As above\",\n\nIf we improve the soil quality to have nutrients over 30, will the plant’s growth rate increase exactly by 1?",
  "Explanation": "From cause to effect with intervention: while improving soil nutrients over 30 will provide an additional growth rate of 1, the total increase might also depend on environmental factors, which may already contribute to the growth rate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
