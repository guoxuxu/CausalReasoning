  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention: 'z' can also increase if 'y' increases, without any change in 'x'. Additionally, 'z' relies not only on 'x' but also on whether 'x' is positive or negative since that affects the formula used to calculate 'z'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
