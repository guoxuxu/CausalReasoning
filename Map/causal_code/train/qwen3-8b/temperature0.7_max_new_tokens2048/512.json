  "Explanation": "A decrease in health risk could also be due to changes in smoking status or diet quality, not necessarily a reduction in age. Since age cannot realistically decrease, this is not a valid conclusion based on the code logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
