  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'sales' in data: \n        data['revenue'] = data['sales'] * data['price'] \n    if data['revenue'] > 1000: \n        data['category'] = 'High' \n    else: \n        data['category'] = 'Low' \n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'sales' increased, would the 'category' likely change to 'High'?",
  "Explanation": "Since an increase in 'sales' would likely increase 'revenue' (given 'revenue' = 'sales' * 'price'), and if 'revenue' exceeds 1000, the 'category' is set to 'High'. Hence, increasing 'sales' can lead directly to switching the 'category' to 'High' if the associated revenue exceeds the threshold.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
