  "Problem": "public class WeatherSimulator { int temperature; boolean isRaining; public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean rain) { this.temperature = temp; this.isRaining = rain; } public void updateWeather(int newTemp, boolean newRain) { this.temperature = newTemp; this.isRaining = newRain; } public boolean isCold() { return this.temperature < 50; } public boolean willRainSoon() { return this.isRaining && this.temperature < 60; } }\",\n\nIf we observe the method isCold() returning false and we earlier intervened by setting temperature to 65, can we infer it was not raining earlier?",
  "Explanation": "The isCold() method only checks the temperature and returns false if the temperature is 50 or higher. This output is independent of the rain status, therefore, we cannot make any inference about it raining or not based solely on isCold() returning false.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
