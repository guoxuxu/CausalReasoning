  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, volume, tax_rate): \n    tax_amount = price * volume * tax_rate \n    total_sales = (price * volume) + tax_amount \n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf a change in government policy results in higher total_sales, can we infer the policy was related to pricing?",
  "Explanation": "Although pricing directly affects total_sales, other factors like volume and tax_rate also contribute to total_sales according to the function. A policy affecting any of these variables could lead to higher total_sales. Thus, without specific information, we cannot definitively infer that a change in policy related to higher total_sales must be due to pricing interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
