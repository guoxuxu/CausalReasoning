  "Explanation": "Seeing an unchanged finalPrice after tax application implies the effect of tax was nullified or balanced by an equivalent discount. Given the method signatures and the typical behaviour of these mechanisms, this implies either that a precise compensatory discount was applied, or more typically, that no discount (0%) was applied and the product bore full tax on its base price. In the specific context of the Product class methods, a zero discount (maintaining the base price intact) likely contributed to this observation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
