  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(balance, rate): \n    interest = balance * rate / 100 \n    return interest \n\nbalance = 5000 \nrate = 5 \ninterest = calculate_interest(balance, rate) \nbalance += interest\",\n\nIf a function is added to regularly update the rate based on external factors, will this change the eventual balance after interest calculation?",
  "Explanation": "By adding a new function that updates the rate based on external factors, which then influences the `interest` outcome through the `calculate_interest` function, this dynamically adjusts the `interest` added to the balance. Consequently, the final `balance` post the interest addition will be altered compared to without this rate adjustment mechanism.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
