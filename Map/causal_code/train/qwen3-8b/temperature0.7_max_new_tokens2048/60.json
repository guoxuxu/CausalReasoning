  "Explanation": "Actively invoking decreaseHumidity can lower humidity significantly, and if humidity drops below 45%, the condition within the method triggers a temperature reduction by 3 degrees. Thus, through intervention by reducing humidity, temperature can be indirectly decreased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
