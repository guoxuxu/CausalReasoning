  "Explanation": "While 'update_heart_rate_based_on_age' increases heart rate based on an increase in age, the heart rate can also increase due to other factors such as exercise ('exercise' method), and not strictly age. Hence, observing a heart rate increase alone cannot definitively confirm an increase in age.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
