  "Explanation": "The total_cost can also increase if a negative discount is applied which effectively increases the total_cost or if a previously added negative item price (if hypothetical) is removed, which increases the total_cost.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
