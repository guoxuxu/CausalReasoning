  "Explanation": "Higher sales alone cannot confirm that the weather was sunny. While sunny weather does boost sales, increased advertising also plays a significant role in sales increment. Therefore, similar sales figures could result from different combinations of weather conditions and advertising efforts.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
