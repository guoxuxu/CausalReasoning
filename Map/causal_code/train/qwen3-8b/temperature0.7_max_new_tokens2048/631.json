  "Explanation": "Modifying the code to always apply the multiplication of values by 1.1 will change the data elements regardless of the 'enhance' flag state. This intervention directly influences the result by altering the way data values are processed within the list, leading to an across-the-board increase in all 'value' fields.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
