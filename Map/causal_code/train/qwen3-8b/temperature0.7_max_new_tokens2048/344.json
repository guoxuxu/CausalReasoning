  "Explanation": "Seeing a 'wear_tshirt' decision does not necessarily mean that the heater was on, as a sufficiently warm weather alone, without the heater, might also result in a higher adjusted temperature leading to a 'wear_tshirt' decision.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
