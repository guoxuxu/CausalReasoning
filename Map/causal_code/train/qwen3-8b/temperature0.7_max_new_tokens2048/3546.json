  "Explanation": "In the given code, there is a conditional check for 'age' being greater than 30. If this condition is satisfied, the discount is initially set at 0.2. This happens without any other intervention, assuming other conditions or absence of other modifiers (like 'new_customer') not discussed in the question.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
