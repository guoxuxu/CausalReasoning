  "Explanation": "A very high variance is indicative of a wide spread of the data. If the 'clean' flag had been set, many extreme values (outliers) would likely have been removed, potentially reducing the variance. Thus, high variance suggests that the data might not have been cleaned (i.e., the 'clean' flag was not set).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
