  "Explanation": "Yes, because the activity determination in 'choose_activity' depends solely on the mood. Even if we set the weather to sunny, intervening by manually setting the mood to 'neutral' would result in the activity changing to 'watching TV'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
