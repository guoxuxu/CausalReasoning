  "Explanation": "Calling 'drive' checks if there is sufficient fuel and then increases the speed by 10 units each time, reducing the fuel by 10. Hence, if 'drive' is called under normal circumstances with sufficient fuel, the speed will indeed increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
