  "Explanation": "The code shows that the 'status' field is determined independently based on the 'income' field without any reference to the 'category' field. Therefore, the intervention of setting 'category' to 'Adult' does not cause or affect the 'income' levels or the setting of 'status' to 'High-income'. The status is solely dependent on the income value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
