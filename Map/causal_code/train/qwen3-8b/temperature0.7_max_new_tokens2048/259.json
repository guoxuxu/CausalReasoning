  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature directly to 5 bypasses the normal update flow through update_temperature and directly impacts the temperature state. Upon any query by get_alert post this intervention, it will check the alert condition, find the temperature less than 10, and return 'Low'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
