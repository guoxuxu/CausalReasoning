  "Explanation": "If the values in result are unchanged, it indicates that the operation could not have been 'scale' or 'add', because both operations inherently change the values based on the scaling_factor. The only condition under which data remains unchanged is if the default 'else' path is taken, where operation is neither 'scale' nor 'add'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
