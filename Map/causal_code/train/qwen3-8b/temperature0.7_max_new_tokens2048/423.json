  "Explanation": "Increasing the activity level above 3 changes the initial condition where the risk was set to 'high' due to both age being over 50 and the activity level being below 3. The condition no longer holds with the activity level above 3, likely leading to a new assessment of risk level.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
