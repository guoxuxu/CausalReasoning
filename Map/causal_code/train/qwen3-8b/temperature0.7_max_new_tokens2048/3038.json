  "Explanation": "Aging from 45 to 55, especially crossing the 50-year threshold, can lead the evaluateRisk method to potentially classify the person at a higher risk category, especially if they have a chronic disease. The original code checks for age greater than 50 to determine a higher risk.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
