  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    scaled_data = data * 10\n    result = scaled_data + 5\n    return result\n\ndata = 3\noutput = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf the value of 'data' is increased, will 'output' also increase, without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The function 'process_data' scales 'data' by multiplying it by 10 and then adds 5 to it to produce 'output'. An increase in 'data' directly leads to an increase in 'scaled_data', which subsequently increases 'result', and hence 'output'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
