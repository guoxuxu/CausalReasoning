  "Explanation": "If decrementing instead of incrementing the result for lowercase characters still results in 'Case 2', it implies that the base (predominantly contributed by uppercase characters) was originally strong enough to keep the result between 1000 and 1500 even with negative adjustments from lowercase characters.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
