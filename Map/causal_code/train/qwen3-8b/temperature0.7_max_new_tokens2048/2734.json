  "Explanation": "Lowering the temperature in 'updateWeather' can lead to a situation where the temperature drops below freezing (0 degrees). If it is already raining ('isRainy' is true), then 'checkFreezing' will return true. This is a straightforward case of tracing the causal path from the cause (temperature) to the effect (freezing condition) without any external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
