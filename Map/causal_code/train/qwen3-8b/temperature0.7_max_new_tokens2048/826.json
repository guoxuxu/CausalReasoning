  "Explanation": "Setting the humidity to 10 and invoking adjust_weather (via set_humidity) would update weather_condition to 'Dry' if the temperature does not imply a 'Cold' condition (i.e., temperature is above 10 degrees). This is because the 'Dry' condition is linked to a low humidity (< 30) while other conditions are not met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
