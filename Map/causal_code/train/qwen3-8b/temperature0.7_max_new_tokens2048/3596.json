  "Explanation": "The `seasonal_sales` are dependent on the product of the `seasonal_factor` and `sales_increase`. Increasing the `seasonal_factor` through external intervention will thus increase `seasonal_sales` and hence `current_sales`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
