  "Explanation": "Connection to the database (`self.connected == True`) does not necessarily lead to records being added, as adding records requires the explicit call of the `add_record` method with proper arguments.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
