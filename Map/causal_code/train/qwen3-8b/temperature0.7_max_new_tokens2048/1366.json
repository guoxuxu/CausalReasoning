  "Explanation": "Reducing sunlight while maintaining other factors continues to leave uncertainty about the respective contributions of water level and soil quality towards the initial higher plant growth. Without specific isolation or additional data on the respective weights, it will be impractical to conclusively attribute the growth to sunlight originally.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
