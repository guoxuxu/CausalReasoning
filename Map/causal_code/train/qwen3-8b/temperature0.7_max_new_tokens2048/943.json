  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private int temperature; private boolean isRaining; public WeatherSimulator(int temp, boolean rain) { temperature = temp; isRaining = rain; } public void increaseTemperature() { temperature += 5; if (temperature > 30) { isRaining = false; } } public boolean willRain() { return isRaining && temperature < 25; } }\",\n\nAfter observing no rain, if we intervene by decreasing the global temperature using external technological means, is it valid to assume that the weather system originally had a temperature above 30°C?",
  "Explanation": "Decreasing the temperature and observing no rain could be due to other reasons such as the initial setting of the 'isRaining' flag to false, which is not solely dependent on temperature. We can’t exclusively conclude the original temperature was above 30°C without information about original settings or other conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
