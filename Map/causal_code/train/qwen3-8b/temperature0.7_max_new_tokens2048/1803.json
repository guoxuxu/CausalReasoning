  "Explanation": "The reset function sets the temperature back to 25 and disables the heating system by setting is_heating_on to False. However, subsequent calls to update_temperature will still change the temperature based on the current external_temp compared to the threshold since the method reset does not interfere with how update_temperature processes its logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
