  "Explanation": "Resetting pollution to initial levels doesn’t necessarily imply that production stopped; it might be due to intervening environmental management actions such as pollution cleanup or introduction of pollution control technologies. Thus, production could still be ongoing even if pollution levels are managed or reduced.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
