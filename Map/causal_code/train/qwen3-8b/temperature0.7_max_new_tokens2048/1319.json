  "Problem": "class CommercialBuilding { int rent; int bill; bool popular_area; int num_tenant(int guests) { this.rent += 50; if(guests > 100 || popular_area) { bill += guests * 2; return guests; } else { return guests / 2; } } void adjust_rent_and_bill(bool economic_crisis) { if(economic_crisis) { rent -= 100; bill += 50; } else { rent += 100; bill -= 20; } }}\",\n\nIf the number of guests increases significantly, will this directly lead to an increase in rent?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in guests indirectly increases rent through the increase in bill when in a popular area or guests exceed 100. This association is inferred because both the number of guests and popularity directly impact the rent by the logic leading to increased rent.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
