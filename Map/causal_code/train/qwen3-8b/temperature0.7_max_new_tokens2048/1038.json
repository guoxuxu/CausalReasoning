  "Problem": "class WeatherStation { float temperature = 25.0; boolean isRaining = false; void updateWeather(float newTemp, boolean rainStatus) { temperature = newTemp; isRaining = rainStatus; } float getTemperature() { return temperature; } boolean getRainStatus() { return isRaining; } } WeatherStation station = new WeatherStation(); station.updateWeather(30.0, true); float currentTemp = station.getTemperature(); boolean currentRainStatus = station.getRainStatus();\",\n\nIf we intervene by directly modifying the 'temperature' attribute of the WeatherStation instance to 28.0 degrees, will a subsequent call to 'getTemperature' return 28.0 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "Although direct modification of attributes is not shown in the original snippet, if there were access to modify the 'temperature' attribute directly, setting it to 28.0 degrees would mean that 'getTemperature' would return 28.0 degrees as it just returns the current value of the 'temperature' attribute.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
