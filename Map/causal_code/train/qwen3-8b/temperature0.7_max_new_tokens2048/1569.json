  "Explanation": "Upon switching the light, the 'clear_cars' function gets called, which clears all cars that were waiting under the green light. So switching the light from 'North-South' to 'East-West' clears all North-South waiting cars.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
