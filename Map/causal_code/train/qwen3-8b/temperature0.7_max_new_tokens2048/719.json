  "Explanation": "Resetting or clearing the 'purchase_history' only affects the historical record of purchases but has no impact on the current levels of 'stock'. The 'stock' variable only changes with calls to 'purchase_item' or 'restock_item'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
