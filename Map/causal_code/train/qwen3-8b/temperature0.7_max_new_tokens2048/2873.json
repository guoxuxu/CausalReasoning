  "Explanation": "An increase in sales to 1000 might not solely be due to the application of a discount under the loyalty program. It is possible that the initial price was already set low enough for the effective price to be below 20, or the discount might have been applied but not under the conditions of the loyalty program.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
