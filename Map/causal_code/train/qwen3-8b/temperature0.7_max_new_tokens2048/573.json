  "Problem": "def compute_health_scores(age, diet_quality, physical_activity_level):\n    base_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_score -= 10\n    if diet_quality < 5:\n        base_score -= 30\n    if physical_activity_level > 7:\n        base_score += 20\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf we increase the age of a person significantly, will the health score generally decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the age parameter beyond 50 decreases the base_score by 10 points, according to the if-condition in the code. This results in a lower overall health score.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
