  "Explanation": "This tests from cause (units sold) to effect (total sales) with an intervention in the form of increasing the units. By selling more units, and holding price and discount rate constant, total sales will increase linearly according to the sales formula, hence showing a direct positive intervention impact.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
