  "Explanation": "While a reduction in sick individuals might also result from natural recovery, in the context of the given system, a significant or rapid decrease usually implies that an intervention, such as medicine distribution, occurred. Without additional information on other factors like natural recovery rates, this remains a plausible explanation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
