  "Explanation": "The unsafety of the car may also be influenced by its model being something other than an 'SUV' or weather conditions being bad. Therefore, an unsafe car doesn't necessarily indicate that the environment itself caused an accident without knowing more specific conditions like weather and car model.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
