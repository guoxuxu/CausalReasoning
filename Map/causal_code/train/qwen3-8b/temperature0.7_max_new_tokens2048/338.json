  "Explanation": "An increase in 'averagePrice' could be due to adding higher price entries, but it could also result from applying a price adjustment through the 'adjustPrice' parameter, making it an unreliable inference unless one knows the value of 'adjustPrice'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
