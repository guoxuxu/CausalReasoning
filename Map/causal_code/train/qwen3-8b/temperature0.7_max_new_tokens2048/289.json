  "Problem": "def compute_health_index(age, diet_quality, exercise_frequency):\n    base_health_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health_score -= (age - 50) * 0.75\n    if diet_quality < 3:\n        base_health_score -= 20\n    else:\n        base_health_score += diet_quality * 5\n    base_health_score += exercise_frequency * 10\n    return base_health_score\",\n\nIf a person increases their exercise frequency, will their health index increase?",
  "Explanation": "The function directly adds to the base_health_score by multiplying exercise frequency by 10, thus an increase in exercise frequency, without any other changes, directly increases the health index.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
