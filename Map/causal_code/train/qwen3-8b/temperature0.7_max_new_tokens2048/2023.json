  "Explanation": "With an intervention that fixes the speedLimit to 65, changes made by the updateTrafficLight method will not impact the speedLimit, as the intervention overrides any other conditionally set speed limits within the adjustSpeedLimit method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
