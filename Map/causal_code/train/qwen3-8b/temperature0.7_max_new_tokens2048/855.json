  "Explanation": "The 'cloudy' weather results when the temperature is between 0 and 30 degrees post increment. A smaller increment can lead to 'cloudy' weather, but anything keeping the temperature after increment within 0 to 30 degree range would also result in 'cloudy' weather. There cannot be a conclusive statement on the specific amount of increment.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
