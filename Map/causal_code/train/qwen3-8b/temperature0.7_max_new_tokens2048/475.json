  "Explanation": "The `adjustTemperature` method controls both the state of `heaterOn` and `temperature` simultaneously. Just setting `heaterOn` to true externally does not change `temperature` in the given code. There's no code segment detected for automatic adjustment of temperature based on the heater's state alone, thus intervention does not lead to the expected automatic result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
