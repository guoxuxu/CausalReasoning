  "Explanation": "The counter increments with each 'A' event. When the counter exceeds 5, the flag is set to true. Thus, repeatedly receiving 'A' will eventually cause the flag to become true.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
