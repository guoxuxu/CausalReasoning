  "Problem": "def calculate_health_effects(smoking, exercise_hours, diet_quality):\n    lung_health = 100 - (20 * smoking) + (10 * exercise_hours)\n    obesity_risk = diet_quality * 30 - exercise_hours * 10\n    cancer_risk = 50 + (25 * smoking) - (5 * diet_quality)\n    return lung_health, obesity_risk, cancer_risk\",\n\nIf we encourage a person to exercise more, while keeping their diet quality constant, is it likely that their obesity risk will decrease?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, increasing exercise hours decreases the `obesity_risk` directly (10 units decrease for each hour of exercise) while diet quality remains unchanged. Hence, intervention by increasing exercise directly leads to a reduction in obesity risk.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
