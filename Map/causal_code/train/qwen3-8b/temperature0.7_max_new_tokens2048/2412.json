  "Explanation": "The function modifies 'data_input' in a non-linear fashion and then either subtracts 10 or returns it directly based on its initial value. If 'result' is below a certain threshold, it isn't possible to distinguish if 'result' came from a 'data_input' slightly below or above this threshold due to the conditional subtraction. Moreover, without knowing if and where the threshold (subtracting 10) kicked in, the original 'data_input' could result in multiple possibilities of 'warmed_data'. Thus, simply knowing 'result' does not provide a clear back-inference to the exact 'data_input'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
