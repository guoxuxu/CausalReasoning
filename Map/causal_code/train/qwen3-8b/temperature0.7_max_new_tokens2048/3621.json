  "Explanation": "Lowering cholesterol would reduce the health risk by decreasing the contribution from high cholesterol (a reduction of 1.5 if cholesterol was above 200). However, since smoking and age both significantly contribute to the health risk, reduction in cholesterol does not conclusively indicate that the remaining high risk is primarily due to smoking rather than age.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
