  "Problem": "def increase_production(cost_increase, demand_rising): \n    if demand_rising: \n        production_units = 100 + cost_increase\n    else: \n        production_units = 50 + cost_increase//2 \n    return production_units\",\n\nIf `production_units` is observed to be more than 100, can we conclude `demand_rising` is True?",
  "Explanation": "The code allows for `production_units` to exceed 100, both when `demand_rising` is True ('production_units = 100 + cost_increase') and when it is False ('production_units = 50 + cost_increase//2'). Thus, simply observing a `production_units` greater than 100 doesn't irrefutably tell us that `demand_rising` is True.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
