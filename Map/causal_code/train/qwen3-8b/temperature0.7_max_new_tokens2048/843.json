  "Problem": "def compute_values(x, y):\n    z = x * y\n    u = z + y\n    if x > 0:\n        v = x + 2\n    else:\n        v = x - 2\n    result = u * v\n    return result\",\n\nBy setting the result to a higher value, can it be inferred that x was specifically increased?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the result to a higher value could be achieved either by increasing x or y, or both. Without knowing specific changes to other variables (like y), it cannot be definitively concluded that the increase in the result was due solely to an increase in x.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
