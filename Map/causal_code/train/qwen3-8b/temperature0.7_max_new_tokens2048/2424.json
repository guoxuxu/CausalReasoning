  "Problem": "\n    sales = [100, 200, 150, 300]\n    prices = [20, 15, 18, 10]\n    discount_events = [0, 1, 0, 1]\n\n    def calculate_revenue(sales, prices):\n        return [x*y for x, y in zip(sales, prices)]\n    \n    def apply_discount(prices, discount_events, discount_rate=0.1):\n        return [p * (1 - discount_rate) if e == 1 else p for p, e in zip(prices, discount_events)]\n\n    discounted_prices = apply_discount(prices, discount_events)\n    revenue = calculate_revenue(sales, discounted_prices)\n  \",\n\nIs a higher revenue indicative of no discount events having occurred?",
  "Explanation": "A higher revenue does not necessarily indicate the absence of discount events. While discounts typically reduce the price, the sales volume or original price levels might still result in high revenue regardless of discounts. Thus, high revenue cannot reliably be traced back to the absence of discount events without additional contextual information.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
