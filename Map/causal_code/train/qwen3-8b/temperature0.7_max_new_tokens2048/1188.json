  "Explanation": "Increasing the basePrice increases the initial value upon which the finalPrice is calculated. Without leverage of any discount, the finalPrice would correlate directly with the basePrice as seen in the calculateTax method used after no discount is applied (default state).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
