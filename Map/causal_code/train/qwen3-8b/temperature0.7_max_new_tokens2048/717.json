  "Explanation": "According to the code, whenever an item is purchased, its quantity is decreased in 'stock', and the transaction is logged into 'purchase_history'. Therefore, any record in 'purchase_history' indeed confirms that the stock was decreased during that transaction.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
