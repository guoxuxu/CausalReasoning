  "Explanation": "A decrease in temperature alone does not directly affect whether it is raining or not in the code, except when temperature goes below zero after rain starts, which freezes the rain instead of it continuing but decreasing temperature by itself doesn't stop the existing rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
