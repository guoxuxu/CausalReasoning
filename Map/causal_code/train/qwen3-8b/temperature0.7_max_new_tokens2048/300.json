  "Explanation": "If the `isRainy` variable is false and we know the temperature was set below 0, based on the code, this would automatically set `isRainy` to false (since it's too cold for rain, only snow if precipitation occurs). This is a direct intervention where the effect ('isRainy' being false) can be explained by the cause (temperature setting below 0).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
