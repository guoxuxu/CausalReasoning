  "Explanation": "Since immunity level is calculated as the product of the number of people and vaccination rate, increasing the number of people while keeping the vaccination rate constant will result in a higher immunity level.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
