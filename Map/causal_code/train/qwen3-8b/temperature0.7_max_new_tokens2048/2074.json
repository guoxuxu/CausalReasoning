  "Explanation": "While 'discounted_price' is influenced by 'season' (different discount rates), the reverse isn't necessarily true. The calculation of 'discounted_price' also depends on 'price'. A change in 'discounted_price' could equally well be due to a change in the 'price' rather than the 'season'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
