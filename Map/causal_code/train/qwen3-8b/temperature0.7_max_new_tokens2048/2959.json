  "Explanation": "An increase in treated patients does not inherently indicate an increase in the number of doctors since a single doctor can treat multiple patients (up to five each). This number can increase due to more patients presenting within the treatable capacity, rather than additional doctors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
