  "Explanation": "A reduction in the final inventory quantity of 'apple', assuming other variables constant, strongly suggests an increase in sales. It's a direct consequence of higher sales subtracting more from the initial quantity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
