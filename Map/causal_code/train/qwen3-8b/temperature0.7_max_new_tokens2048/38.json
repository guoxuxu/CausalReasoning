  "Problem": "def update_score(age, score, training_completed): \n    if age > 18: \n        score += 10 \n    if training_completed: \n        score += 20 \n    return score\",\n\nIf a person is younger than 18 years old and had training, will their score increase?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, if a person completes the training, their score increases by 20, regardless of their age. So, even if the person is younger than 18, the completion of training will still result in a score increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
