  "Explanation": "Setting `wc.heating_on` to True manually does not affect or reflect the actual outdoor temperature. This intervention bypasses the normal conditional check within the `adjust_heating` method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
