  "Explanation": "A high health risk could be due to the weight being either less than 50 kg or more than 100 kg. It is not solely dependent on the diet quality unless combined with age over 50, or if both weight and diet are in normal ranges. Therefore, a person with a high health risk does not necessarily have a poor diet.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
