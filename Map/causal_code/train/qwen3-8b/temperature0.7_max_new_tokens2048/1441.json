  "Explanation": "Direct intervention by setting 'primary_need' to 'water' and 'secondary_need' to 'sunlight' for all plants ensures that the condition in Plant's 'check_health' method is met for each plant, thereby making all plants healthy irrespective of their initial state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
