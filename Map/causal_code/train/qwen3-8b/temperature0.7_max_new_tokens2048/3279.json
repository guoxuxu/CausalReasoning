  "Explanation": "While increasing 'economic_index' can raise 'future_sales', 'future_sales' can also be impacted by other factors like 'marketing_spend' and variance in 'historical_sales'. Thus, an increase in 'future_sales' does not necessarily mean that 'economic_index' has increased.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
