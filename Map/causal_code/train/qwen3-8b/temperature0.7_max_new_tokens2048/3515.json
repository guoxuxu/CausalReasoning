  "Explanation": "While the temperature greater than 30 does cause a reduction in humidity, low humidity alone cannot definitively indicate high temperatures because humidity also has a broad random range (20 to 90) independently of temperature effects. Low humidity could occur with low or moderate temperatures as well.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
