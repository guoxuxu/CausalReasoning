  "Explanation": "Observing a higher final_price and testing by resetting the tax_rate to a known default can help determine whether the increase was due to an initially higher tax_rate. By controlling the tax_rate (intervention) and observing changes in final_price, one can causally link unexpected increases in final_price to variations in the tax_rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
