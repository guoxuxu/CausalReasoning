  "Problem": "[See above Python code snippet]\",\n\nIf we intervene by adding nutrients to the soil without modifying sunlight or water, and observe that plants are growing poorly, can we conclude that the sunlight was insufficient?",
  "Explanation": "Poor plant growth despite nutrient addition could result from insufficient sunlight or water, or other uncontrolled factors. It is not definitive only to sunlight insufficiency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
