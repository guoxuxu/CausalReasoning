  "Problem": "def analyze_purchases(user, products, preference_threshold):\n    total_spent = 0\n    preferred_products = []\n    for product in products:\n        if product['price'] > preference_threshold:\n            user['budget'] -= product['price']\n            total_spent += product['price']\n            if product['category'] in user['preferences']:\n                preferred_products.append(product)\n    return total_spent, preferred_products\",\n\nIf the preference_threshold is lowered, will total_spent necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "Lowering the preference_threshold might result in more products being purchased if they are above the new lower threshold, but if the user's budget restricts additional purchases or if no additional products meet the new threshold relative to preferences and product categories, then total spent might not increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
