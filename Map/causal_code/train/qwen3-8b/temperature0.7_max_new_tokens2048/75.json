  "Explanation": "The apply_discount method updates the discount and recalculates the final_price. As the discount rate increases, the amount subtracted from the price increases, thus decreasing the final_price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
