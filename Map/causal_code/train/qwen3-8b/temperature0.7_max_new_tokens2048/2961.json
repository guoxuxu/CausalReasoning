  "Explanation": "If an increase in treated patients coincides with the hiring of more doctors, it's reasonable to infer causality due to the direct relationship in the health system's capacity to treat additional patients based on the number of doctors employed, provided that there are enough patients requiring treatment.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
