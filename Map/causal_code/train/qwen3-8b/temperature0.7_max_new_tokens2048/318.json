  "Explanation": "An increase in 'calculateTotal' output could result either from an increase in 'salesAmount' or an increase in 'taxRate'. Without specific information about the cause of change in 'calculateTotal', we cannot definitively say that it was due to an increase in 'salesAmount'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
