  "Explanation": "Several factors can lead to a decrease in 'result' such as reductions in data variability or an alteration in preprocessing steps not specified (e.g., filtering outliers). Without precise information on what intervention was made on 'data', a decrease in 'result' does not conclusively point to a specific pre-averaging transformation change.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
