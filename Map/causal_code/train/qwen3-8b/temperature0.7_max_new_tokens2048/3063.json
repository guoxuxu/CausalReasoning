  "Explanation": "A higher average printed by analyze_data does not necessarily imply that all original values in data_sequence were above 5. It indicates that there were enough values above 5, and these values were large enough when tripled to raise the average. Values not above 5 are simply not included in the processed data but do not directly indicate their absence or presence based solely on the average.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
