  "Explanation": "The Green light might be a result of the regular light cycle (Green to Red to Green) that does not necessarily coincide with changes in weather conditions. It does not switch back to Green immediately after it stops raining if it was Yellow.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
