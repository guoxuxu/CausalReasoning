  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'age' in data and data['age'] > 18: \n        data['status'] = 'adult' \n    else: \n        data['status'] = 'minor' \n    if data.get('income', 0) > 50000: \n        data['class'] = 'high' \n    elif data.get('income') < 30000: \n        data['class'] = 'low' \n    else: \n        data['class'] = 'middle' \n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'age' value is 25, will the 'status' be 'adult'?",
  "Explanation": "The function checks if 'age' is greater than 18 to set 'status' to 'adult'. Since 25 is greater than 18, 'status' will be 'adult'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
