  "Explanation": "Even with the ability to control temperature and humidity, an increased temperature alone does not necessarily imply it was Sunday. This is because the artificial setting or control of these values can mask the natural conditions that would typically influence these measurements according to the weekday or season.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
