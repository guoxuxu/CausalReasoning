  "Explanation": "The health state of a plant is dependent on the alterations made to 'primary_need' and 'secondary_need' by the methods in the Garden class. These needs are adjusted via 'water_plants' and 'sunbathe_plants' methods, which set the necessary conditions for a plant's health as checked in 'check_health' method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
