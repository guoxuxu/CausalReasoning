  "Problem": "class ClimateControlSystem: def __init__(self, temperature): self.temperature = temperature def heat(self, increase): self.temperature += increase if self.temperature > 30: self.temperature = 30 def cool(self, decrease): self.temperature -= decrease if self.temperature < 15: self.temperature = 15 def check_temp(self): return 'Warm' if self.temperature > 25 else 'Cold'\",\n\nIf the temperature is initially set at 20 and then the 'cool' method is invoked with a decrease value of 10, will the 'check_temp' method return 'Cold'?",
  "Explanation": "The 'cool' method decreases the temperature and has a lower limit set at 15. Decreasing temperature by 10 units from 20 sets it exactly at 15 due to this lower limit, and 'check_temp' returns 'Cold' for any temperature less than or equal to 25.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
