  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_threshold=10):\n    filtered_data = [d for d in data if d > filter_threshold]\n    summary = sum(filtered_data)\n    return summary\n\ndata = [1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]\nresult = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf the filter_threshold parameter is changed to 5, will the outcome (result) necessarily change?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the filter_threshold influences the set of data points considered in computing the summary. Lowering the threshold from 10 to 5 includes more data points in the filter (data that are above 5), hence altering the values in filtered_data and ultimately changing the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
