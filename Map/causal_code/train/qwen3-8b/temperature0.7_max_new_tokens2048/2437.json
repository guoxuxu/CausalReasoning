  "Explanation": "By modifying the HealthSystem class’s assessRisk method to include vaping as equivalent to smoking, the 52-year-old patient who vapes would meet the high-risk criteria (assuming age and vaping/smoking as risk factors). Since this hypothetical intervention aligns vaping with smoking, the outcome where the patient is deemed high risk follows logically.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
