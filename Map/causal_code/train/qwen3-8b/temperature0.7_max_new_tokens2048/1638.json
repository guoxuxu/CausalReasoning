  "Explanation": "Changing the status of peak_hours to always True does not influence the inner workings of the function analyze_traffic or the accumulation of the traffic variable. peak_hours being True is a downstream effect and does not create a feedback loop to affect how the function computes traffic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
