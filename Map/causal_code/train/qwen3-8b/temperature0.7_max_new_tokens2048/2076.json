  "Explanation": "Altering the 'UnitPrice' directly affects the 'Total', as 'Total' is calculated by multiplying 'Quantity' by 'UnitPrice'. This is a direct cause-to-effect relationship without intervening variables.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
