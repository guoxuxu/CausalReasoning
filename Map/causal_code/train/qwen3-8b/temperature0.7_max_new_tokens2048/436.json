  "Explanation": "The application of a discount directly modifies the total irrespective of the addition or removal of items. Therefore, without adding or removing items, the sole action of applying a discount would still lower the total.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
