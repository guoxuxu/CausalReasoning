  "Explanation": "Even though the health summary might change to 'Healthy' after intervention, it's impossible to decisively trace back and determine the exact original daily steps simply based on the outcome, due to multiple possible starting points and intervention effects (heart rate adjustment).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
