  "Explanation": "An increase in cleared cars indicates that the count of waiting cars was high when the light switched and cleared, but it doesn't imply that these cars arrived just before being cleared. They could have been waiting from earlier cycles.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
