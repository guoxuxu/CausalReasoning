  "Explanation": "External interventions that frequently reset the timing system disrupt the normal cycle based on green_light_duration and red_light_duration. Hence, deducing the original duration settings from observing the light's frequency of switching becomes unreliable and inaccurate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
