  "Problem": "class PlantSystem {\n  double growthRate = 1.0;\n  boolean isSunny;\n  boolean hasFertilizer;\n\n  double simulateGrowth() {\n    if (isSunny) {\n      growthRate *= 1.2;\n    }\n    if (hasFertilizer) {\n      growthRate *= 1.5;\n    }\n    return growthRate;\n  }\n\n  void applyFertilizer() {\n    hasFertilizer = true;\n  }\n\n  void setWeather(boolean sunny) {\n    isSunny = sunny;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf it is sunny, can we expect the plant's growth rate to increase without adding fertilizer?",
  "Explanation": "Yes, the growth rate increases due to the multiplicative factor when the weather is sunny, independent of fertilizer application, as seen in the if condition that checks the boolean 'isSunny'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
