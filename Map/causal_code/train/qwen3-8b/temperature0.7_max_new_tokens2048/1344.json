  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  if 'age' in data:\n    data['age'] = max(18, min(data.get('age', 30), 65))\n  if 'income' in data and data['age'] > 30:\n    data['income'] *= 1.2\n  return data\",\n\nIf 'income' is increased in the output, can we infer that there was a key 'age' greater than 30 in the input data?",
  "Explanation": "The code specifies that 'income' is only modified if 'age' is greater than 30. Hence, if income is increased, it implies that 'age' must have been greater than 30.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
