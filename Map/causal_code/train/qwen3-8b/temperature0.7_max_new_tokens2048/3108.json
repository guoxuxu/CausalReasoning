  "Explanation": "The `drive` method in the code decreases the fuel level by 1 unit every time it's called, if the engine is on. When the fuel reaches zero, the engine status is automatically set to 'off' with a corresponding message. Thus, observation of the engine turning off after being on indicates the car has run out of fuel.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
