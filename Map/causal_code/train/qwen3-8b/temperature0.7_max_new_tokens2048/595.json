  "Explanation": "Changing the age threshold in the 'determine_eligibility' function will affect eligibility, thereby potentially increasing the number of customers who receive either 'Premium Offer' or 'Standard Offer', depending on their activity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
