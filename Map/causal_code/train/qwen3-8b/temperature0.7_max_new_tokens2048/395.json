  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data): \n    modified_data = input_data * 2 \n    final_data = modified_data + 10 \n    return final_data \n\nuser_input = 20 \nresult = process_data(user_input)\",\n\nIf an external function modifies user_input by adding 5 before it is passed to process_data, will final_data increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the user_input by 5 before it is processed leads to an increase in final_data. In the process_data function, modified_data becomes (user_input + 5) * 2, and final_data will be ((user_input + 5) * 2) + 10, therefore increasing overall.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
