  "Explanation": "Given the logic of the code, the only pathway for discountApplied to be set true is through the applyDiscount method, which is called exclusively when the totalSales exceed the discountThreshold during the updateSales method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
