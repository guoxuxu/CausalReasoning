  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'user_activity' in data:\n        if data['user_activity'] > 100:\n            data['category'] = 'high'\n        else:\n            data['category'] = 'low'\n    else:\n        data['category'] = 'unknown'\n    return data\",\n\nIf 'user_activity' is removed from the data dictionary, will the 'category' always be 'unknown'?",
  "Explanation": "The code checks if 'user_activity' is a key in the data dictionary. If the key is absent, it assigns 'unknown' to 'category'. Removing 'user_activity' results in the 'category' being set to 'unknown' without needing any intervention in the logic of the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
