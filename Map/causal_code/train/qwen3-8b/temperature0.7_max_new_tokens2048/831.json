  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'total' might suggest that a discount was applied, but it could also be due to the removal of an item via 'remove_item'. Hence, a decrease in the total alone does not conclusively indicate that a discount was applied.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
