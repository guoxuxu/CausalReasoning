  "Problem": "class Plant { constructor() { this.waterLevel = 0; } water() { this.waterLevel += 5; } soakSun() { this.waterLevel += 3; } dayPasses() { this.waterLevel -= 4; } getStatus() { return this.waterLevel >= 10 ? 'Healthy' : 'Unhealthy'; } } const myGarden = new Plant(); myGarden.water(); myGarden.soakSun(); myGarden.dayPasses(); const plantStatus = myGarden.getStatus();\",\n\nIf an operational tweak is made to increase the water added by 'water()' from 5 units to 7 units, will a single call to 'water()' suffice to keep the plant healthy after 'dayPasses()' is called?",
  "Explanation": "Currently, a single call of 'water()' adds 5 units and 'dayPasses()' subtracts 4 units, which barely affects the plant's health positively. Increasing water added by 'water()' to 7 units results in a net gain in water level even after 'dayPasses()' (7-4=3 units). Therefore, this intervention (increasing water units) enables a single watering to maintain or improve the plant's health after a day passes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
