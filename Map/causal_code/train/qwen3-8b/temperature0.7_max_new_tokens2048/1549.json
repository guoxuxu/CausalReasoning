  "Explanation": "Setting humidity to 70% alone doesn't guarantee 'Thunderstorm' weather conditions, as the occurrence also relies on the temperature being above 30, based on the conditions defined in the method update_weather.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
