  "Explanation": "An increase in price could either be due to natural market dynamics (i.e., demand increasing more rapidly than supply) or due to an external intervention. Without additional information about supply and demand at the time of price increase, we cannot definitely conclude a government intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
