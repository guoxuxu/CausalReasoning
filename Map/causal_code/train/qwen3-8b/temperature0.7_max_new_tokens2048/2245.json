  "Problem": "public class WeatherForecast { private boolean cloudy; private boolean rain; public WeatherForecast(boolean cloudy) { this.cloudy = cloudy; if(this.cloudy) { this.rain = Math.random() > 0.7; } else { this.rain = Math.random() > 0.9; } } public boolean willItRain() { return this.rain; } }\",\n\nIf we manipulate the weather to be cloudy, will the probability of rain increase?",
  "Explanation": "Artificially setting the 'cloudy' variable to true in the WeatherForecast class increases the probability of 'rain' being true from 10% to 30%. This is a hypothetical intervention where changing the cause directly impacts the likelihood of the effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
