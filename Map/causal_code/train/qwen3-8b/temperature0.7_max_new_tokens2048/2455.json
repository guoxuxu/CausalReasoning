  "Explanation": "Increasing the temperature from 15 to 25 raises the likelihood that the temperature condition (>20) for good mood (not raining and temperature > 20) is satisfied. Since being in a good mood correlates directly with choosing 'Go to the park', this likely leads to more instances of this activity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
