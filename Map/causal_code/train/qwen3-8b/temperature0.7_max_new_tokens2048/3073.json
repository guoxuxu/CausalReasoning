  "Explanation": "Modifying the 'category' to 'unknown' in the return statement is an intervention that alters the output directly, but it does not affect the input data structure or the presence of 'user_activity'. Input data's structure or content is not causally dependent on the output manipulations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
