  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    base = 5\n    data_squared = [x**2 for x in data]\n    data_multiplied = [x * base for x in data]\n    sum_squared = sum(data_squared)\n    sum_multiplied = sum(data_multiplied)\n    final_value = sum_squared + sum_multiplied\n    return final_value\",\n\nIf 'base' is increased, will the 'final_value' also increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'base' affects 'data_multiplied' directly by increasing the multiplier, thus leading to a higher sum for 'sum_multiplied', and consequently, a higher 'final_value'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
