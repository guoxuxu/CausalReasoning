  "Explanation": "An increase in the total_salary could result either from an increase in the base_salary or from the application of a bonus (if previously not applied) or an increment in the bonus rate. Therefore, increasing total_salary does not solely depend on the base_salary.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
