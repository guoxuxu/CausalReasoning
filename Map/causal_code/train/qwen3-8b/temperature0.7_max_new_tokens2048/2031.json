  "Problem": "Provided Python Snippet Above\",\n\nIf the government revokes the mandate, how will it affect the eligibility for priority vaccination of a person with a risk score of 50?",
  "Explanation": "Without the government mandate, the threshold for vaccination rises to 50 and the eligibility of a person with a risk score of 50 remains unaffected since they meet this new threshold exactly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
