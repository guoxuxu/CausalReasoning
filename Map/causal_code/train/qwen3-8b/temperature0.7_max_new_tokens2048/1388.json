  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    if flag > 0:\n        result = sum(data) + 10\n    else:\n        result = sum(data) - 5\n    return result\n\ndata_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nflag_value = 3\noutput = process_data(data_list, flag_value)\",\n\nDoes a change in output imply a change in flag_value?",
  "Explanation": "A change in output does not necessarily indicate a change in the 'flag_value'. Output could also change if the 'data_list' is altered since the output is dependent on both the 'flag_value' and the 'data_list'. Thus, this question explores the understanding of 'from effect to cause without intervention,' stressing the importance of differentiating between correlation and causation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
