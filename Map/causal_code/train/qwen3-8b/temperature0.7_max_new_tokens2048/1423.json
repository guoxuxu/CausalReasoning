  "Problem": "class AirConditioner { constructor(powerState, temperature) { this.isOn = powerState; this.temperature = temperature; }  setTemperature(newTemp) { if (this.isOn && newTemp >= 16 && newTemp <= 30) { this.temperature = newTemp; } } togglePower() { this.isOn = !this.isOn; if (!this.isOn) { this.temperature = null; } } }\",\n\nIf the air conditioner is initially off and a setTemperature(20) method call is made, will the temperature change?",
  "Explanation": "Because the air conditioner is off, the condition `this.isOn` evaluates to false. Thus, the method setTemperature does not change the temperature due to the failed condition check.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
