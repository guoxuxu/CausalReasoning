  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature higher (intervening) while keeping the pressure constant will lead to an increase in temperature (x) that results in a smaller ratio (z = y / x) because the unchanged pressure (y) will be divided by a larger temperature value.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
