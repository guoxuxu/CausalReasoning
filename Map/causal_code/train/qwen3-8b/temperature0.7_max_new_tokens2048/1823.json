  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  private boolean isRaining;\n  private int temperature;\n  public WeatherSimulator(int temperature, boolean isRaining) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.isRaining = isRaining;\n  }\n  public void adjustWeather(int newTemp) {\n    if (newTemp < 0) {\n        this.isRaining = false;\n    }\n    this.temperature = newTemp;\n  }\n  public boolean checkUmbrellaNeed() {\n    return isRaining && temperature <= 20;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the temperature is set to -5 degrees, will it stop raining in the simulator?",
  "Explanation": "The adjustWeather method applies the condition that if the new temperature is below 0, it sets isRaining to false. Therefore, lowering the temperature to -5 degrees directly intervenes and stops the rain in the simulation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
