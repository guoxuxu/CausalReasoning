  "Problem": "def update_inventory(products, sold, restocked):\n    inventory = {product: stock for product, stock in products.items()}\n    for product in sold:\n        if product in inventory:\n            inventory[product] -= sold[product]\n    for product in restocked:\n        if product in inventory:\n            inventory[product] += restocked[product]\n    return inventory\",\n\nWould implementing a policy that limits the maximum number of items a single product can have sold lead to higher final inventory levels?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing an intervention by setting a sales limit (cause) constrains the maximum items sold, directly affecting the end inventory (effect). By reducing the number of items that can be sold, inventory depletion is controlled leading to potentially higher stock levels than would occur without such limits. This is a clear transition from cause to effect but with a deliberate intervention modulating the process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
