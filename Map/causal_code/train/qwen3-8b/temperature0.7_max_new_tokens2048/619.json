  "Explanation": "With intervention, decreasing the traffic density to 40 on a non-holiday (implicitly changing the trafficDensity), will lead to an increase in traffic speed to 70 km/h according to the `else if` condition in the `calculateTrafficSpeed()` method, where it checks if the trafficDensity is less than 50.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
