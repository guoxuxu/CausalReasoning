  "Explanation": "Even if the 'age' key is missing, the handle_request function processes the data if 'authenticated' is True. The 'age' key does not impact the logic controlling the entry to the process_data function, and thus the status 'processed' is based primarily on authentication, not the presence of 'age'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
