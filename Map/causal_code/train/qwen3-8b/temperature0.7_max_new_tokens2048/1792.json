  "Explanation": "Stopping rain through intervention could be achieved either by reducing humidity below 50 or by ensuring it's not cloudy, or both. The code allows rain to be stopped by merely ensuring it is not cloudy, regardless of the humidity level. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that humidity is below 50 just because the rain was stopped.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
