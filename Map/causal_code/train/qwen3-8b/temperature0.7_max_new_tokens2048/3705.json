  "Explanation": "Given that the code automatically turns off the air conditioning after 18:00, if the air conditioning remains on, it indicates an intervention (such as manual override). This is an example of deducing the cause (manual intervention) from the effect (air conditioning state) with an intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
