  "Explanation": "The observed decrease in heart rate cannot exclusively confirm the intake of 'beta_blocker' as other factors may also decrease heart rate, such as natural variance or unknown factors not captured in the provided code. Therefore, predicting the intake of 'beta_blocker' from a decrease in heart rate alone involves uncertainty without further intervention or information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
