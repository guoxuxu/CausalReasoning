  "Problem": "Python code snippet provided above\",\n\nIf the ecosystem starts with a higher predator_population, will this lead to a higher initial herbivore_population?",
  "Explanation": "Starting with a higher predator_population would actually lead to a more substantial decrease in herbivore_population initially, due to higher predation rates as governed by the feed_predators and natural_selection methods.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
