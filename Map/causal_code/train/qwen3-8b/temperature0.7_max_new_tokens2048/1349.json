  "Explanation": "Adjusting car_density influences traffic_flow directly when the signal is green. The increase in car_density results in a corresponding increase in traffic_flow, as stipulated by the multiply by 20 until the maximum of 100 in the update_traffic_flow method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
