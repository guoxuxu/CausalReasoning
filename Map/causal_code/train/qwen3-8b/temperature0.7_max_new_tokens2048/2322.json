  "Explanation": "Changes in the output structure of the `analyze` function do not necessarily imply that there were alterations in the `clean` function. The `analyze` function's output can be modified independently of the `clean` function, such as by changing how data is summarized or presented in the result, without any impact on data cleaning.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
