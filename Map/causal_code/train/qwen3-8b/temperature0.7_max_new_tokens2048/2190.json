  "Explanation": "This response understands causality from the cause (forcing the list to be empty) to the effect (calculation outcome) with an intervention. If the item list is explicitly made empty, regardless of prior discounts or additions, 'calculate_total' will naturally sum to zero.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
