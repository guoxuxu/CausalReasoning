  "Problem": "Python code provided above\",\n\nDoes a higher initial public awareness indicate a higher initial level of pollution?",
  "Explanation": "Public awareness is partially determined by pollution levels (0.1 * pollution). Thus, higher public awareness suggests higher pollution, assuming no policies have yet affected the awareness level.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "Pollution Level → Public Awareness; Government Policies → Public Awareness; Media Coverage → Public Awareness; Public Awareness → Pollution Reduction Efforts; Pollution Reduction Efforts → Pollution Level; Economic Development → Pollution Level; Technology → Pollution Level"
