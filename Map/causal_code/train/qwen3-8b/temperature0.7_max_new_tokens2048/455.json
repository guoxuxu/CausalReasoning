  "Problem": "WeatherSystem Python Class\",\n\nIf you manually increase the wind speed to 20 km/h, will the humidity level increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the wind speed directly triggers the apply_wind_effect method which increases humidity by 5 when the wind speed is above 10 km/h.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
