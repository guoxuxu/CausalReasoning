  "Explanation": "An increase in car count indicates that the traffic light was green, but it does not specifically indicate whether the light was toggled due to a regular pattern or an intervention. The light could have been already set green without any manual intervention, or it could be following its natural toggle cycle.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
