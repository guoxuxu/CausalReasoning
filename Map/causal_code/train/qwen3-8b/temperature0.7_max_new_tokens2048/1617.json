  "Explanation": "Doubling the daily steps through apply_intervention changes the steps to 8000 and adjusts the heart rate to 99 (110 * 0.9). Despite these interventions, since the original condition checks heart rate AFTER checking for age and daily steps threshold, the person will still be classified based on the original data and still meets the 'At risk' condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
