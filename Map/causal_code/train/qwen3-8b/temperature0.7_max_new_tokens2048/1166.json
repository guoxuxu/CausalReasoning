  "Explanation": "According to the code logic, the priority is set to 'high' if 'processing_time' is less than or equal to 100 and the status is 'success'. Thus, intervening to set 'processing_time' to 50, assuming the status is 'success' and no other dependencies exist, will change the priority to 'high'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
