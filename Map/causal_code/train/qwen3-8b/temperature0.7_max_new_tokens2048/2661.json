  "Explanation": "If the final status is 'RETRY', it indicates that not only was there an error (leading to a status of 'FAIL'), but also the 'retry' key had to have been explicitly set to True. This is the only scenario under the current code logic where the status would be modified to 'RETRY'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
