  "Explanation": "The air conditioning being off doesn't necessarily mean that the temperature is 22 degrees or below. The air conditioning could also be off because the time of day is after 18:00, as per the code. This indicates there are other factors affecting the air conditioning status apart from the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
