  "Explanation": "The method `adjustTemperature` checks if the `desiredTemp` is higher than the `current temperature`. If true, it sets `heaterOn` to true. This is a direct cause (higher temperature setting) leading to an effect (heater turning on) without any external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
