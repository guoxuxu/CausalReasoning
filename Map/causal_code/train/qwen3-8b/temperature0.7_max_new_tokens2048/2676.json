  "Explanation": "Setting the ad quality to 'High' directly affects the estimated reach via increased multiplier, independent of market conditions. While market conditions might influence the actual sales conversion, they do not influence the calculation of estimated reach as per provided code logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
