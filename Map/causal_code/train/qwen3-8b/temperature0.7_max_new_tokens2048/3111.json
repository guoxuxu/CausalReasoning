  "Explanation": "A lower base_index does indeed correspond to ages over 50 as per the logic in the code, but a base_index of 70 could technically also occur in cases where the age is not over 50 but a higher activity level compensates for the deduction due to higher weight, maintaining the index at the said value. Thus, the correlation alone cannot definitively imply causation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
