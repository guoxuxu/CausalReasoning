  "Explanation": "Turning the air conditioner on does not directly impact the temperature in the given methods. The temperature is controlled independently by `increaseTemperature` and `decreaseTemperature`, and there is no automatic temperature change linked to the air conditioner being turned on.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
