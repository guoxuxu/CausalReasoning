  "Problem": "class SalesAnalyzer { int numberOfSales; double pricePerUnit; SalesAnalyzer(int sales, double price) { numberOfSales = sales; pricePerUnit = price; } double calculateRevenue() { return numberOfSales * pricePerUnit; } void increasePrice(double increment) { pricePerUnit += increment; } double predictedRevenue(double increment) { double newPrice = pricePerUnit + increment; return numberOfSales * newPrice; } }\",\n\nDoes a decrease in returned value from `calculateRevenue()` imply a decrease in `numberOfSales`?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in revenue can occur due to either a decrease in `numberOfSales` or a decrease in `pricePerUnit`. Without specific information about the change in `pricePerUnit`, one cannot conclusively state that `numberOfSales` has decreased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
