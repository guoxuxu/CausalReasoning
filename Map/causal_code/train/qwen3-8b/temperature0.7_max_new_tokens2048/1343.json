  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  if 'age' in data:\n    data['age'] = max(18, min(data.get('age', 30), 65))\n  if 'income' in data and data['age'] > 30:\n    data['income'] *= 1.2\n  return data\",\n\nIf the 'age' key exists in the input dictionary and its value is set to 50 before invoking process_data, will the income be modified in the returned dictionary?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, if 'age' is above 30 and 'income' is provided, 'income' will be increased by 20%. Since the age is set to 50, which is above 30, and assuming 'income' exists, it will be modified.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
