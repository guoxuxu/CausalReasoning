  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, demand, tax_rate):\n    tax = price * demand * tax_rate\n    final_sales = price * demand + tax\n    return final_sales\",\n\nIf we set a fixed tax_rate and increase the price, will this lead to an increase in final_sales?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening to set the tax_rate fixed and increasing the price will result in an increase in the tax component (price * demand * fixed tax_rate) and the price * demand component of final_sales. These changes will lead to an overall increase in final_sales, as seen from the multiplication relationships in the code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
