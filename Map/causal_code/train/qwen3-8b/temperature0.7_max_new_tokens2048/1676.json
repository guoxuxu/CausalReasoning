  "Problem": "def compute_final_score(base_score, bonus, penalty, is_new_user): \n  if is_new_user:\n    bonus *= 2\n  final_score = base_score + bonus - penalty\n  return final_score\",\n\nIf the 'final_score' increases, does it imply the 'base_score' was increased?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in 'final_score' could be due to an increase in 'base_score', an increase in 'bonus', or a decrease in 'penalty', or some combination of these changes. The presence of multiple influencing factors means that an increase in 'final_score' does not definitively imply that 'base_score' was increased. This shows a limitation in tracing back effects to a specific cause without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
