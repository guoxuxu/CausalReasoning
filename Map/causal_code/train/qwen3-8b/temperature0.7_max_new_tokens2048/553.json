  "Problem": "def compute_health_scores(age, weight, exercise_hours):\n    health_risk = (age * 0.2 + weight * 0.5) - exercise_hours * 2\n    if health_risk > 50:\n        return 'High Risk'\n    elif 20 <= health_risk <= 50:\n        return 'Medium Risk'\n    else:\n        return 'Low Risk'\",\n\nIf the age and weight of a person increases, will the health risk category 'High Risk' likely result more often without any changes to exercise hours?",
  "Explanation": "Since age and weight contribute positively to the health_risk score, and exercise hours are not changed to offset these effects, increasing age and weight increase the health_risk score, leading to a more probable 'High Risk' categorization.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
