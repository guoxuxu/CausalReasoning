  "Problem": "def increase_production(cost_increase, demand_rising): \n    if demand_rising: \n        production_units = 100 + cost_increase\n    else: \n        production_units = 50 + cost_increase//2 \n    return production_units\",\n\nIf the `cost_increase` is held at 0, will increasing `demand_rising` from False to True increase `production_units`?",
  "Explanation": "When `cost_increase` is 0 and `demand_rising` changes from False to True, `production_units` shifts from `50 + 0//2` to `100 + 0`. This change increases `production_units` from 50 to 100, reflecting a direct implication of increasing `demand_rising` with controlled `cost_increase`.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
