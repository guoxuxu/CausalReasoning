  "Explanation": "The calculation of 'bonus_sales' is purely based on the condition of discount_factor and does not depend on 'final_sales'. Thus, intervening to change the 'final_sales' manually does not causally affect the determination of 'bonus_sales' based on the given code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
