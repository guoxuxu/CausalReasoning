  "Problem": "def update_temperature(weather_data, action):\n    temperature = weather_data['temperature']\n    if action == 'increase':\n        temperature += 3\n    elif action == 'decrease':\n        temperature -= 5\n    return temperature\n\n# Example usage\ncurrent_weather = {'temperature': 20}\nnew_temperature = update_temperature(current_weather, 'increase')\",\n\nIf a mechanism is introduced to control external temperature influences, would setting the action to 'increase' consistently raise the indoor temperature by 3 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "With the addition of an external control mechanism ensuring no other temperature influences, the function's action 'increase' will consistently raise the temperature by exactly 3 degrees as defined in the function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
