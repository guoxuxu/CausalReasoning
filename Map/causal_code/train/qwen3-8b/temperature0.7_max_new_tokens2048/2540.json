  "Explanation": "Machine halting on an error is conditional. For a 'printing' job with low priority (<5), the machine 'pauses' instead of halting immediately. Similarly, 'scanning' jobs with low priority (<5) are not affected by the error_status in terms of halting, as they will 'delay'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
