  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total_price = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == 'SAVE10' else 0.05 if coupon_code == 'SAVE5' else 0\n    discount = total_price * discount_rate\n    final_price = total_price - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the coupon_code is 'SAVE10', will the final_price be lower?",
  "Explanation": "Since the discount rate for coupon code 'SAVE10' is 0.1 (10%), this leads to higher discount amounts being subtracted from the total price, resulting in a lower final price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
