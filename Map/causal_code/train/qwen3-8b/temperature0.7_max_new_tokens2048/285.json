  "Explanation": "The discount rate directly affects a product's price through the 'apply_discount' method, reducing it by a percentage equivalent to the discount rate. This reduction in product price naturally lowers the total price when 'calculate_total' is called.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
