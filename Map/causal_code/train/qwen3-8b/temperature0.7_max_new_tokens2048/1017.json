  "Problem": "def calculate_health(score, age, medication):\n    base_health = 100\n    health = base_health - age + score * 10\n    if medication:\n        health += 30\n    return health\n\npatient_score = 8\npatient_age = 40\nmedication_taken = True\n\npatient_health = calculate_health(patient_score, patient_age, medication_taken)\",\n\nDoes a calculated health of more than 130 suggest the patient took medication?",
  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention: If no information about changes in 'score' or 'age' is given, a health score above 130 could imply the use of medication. This is inferred from 'health += 30' if medication is true, which increases the maximum without medication (170 without medication from ideal conditions of age 0 and score 17) to 200.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
