  "Explanation": "Since the age is over 50, changing the smoker status from 'non-smoker' to 'smoker' directly affects the condition that leads to a 'High' risk category according to the update_health_risk method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
