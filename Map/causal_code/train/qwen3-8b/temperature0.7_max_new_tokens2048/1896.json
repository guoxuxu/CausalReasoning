  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data['value'] + 2\n    y = x * 3\n    if y > 20:\n        result = True\n    else:\n        result = False\n    z = y - 5\n    return {'result': result, 'z': z}\",\n\nIf we observe that 'z' is 25, can we determine whether 'result' was True during execution?",
  "Explanation": "Knowing 'z' equals 25 only informs us that 'y' was originally 30 (since 'z' = 'y' - 5). This tells us 'y' was greater than 20, which could imply 'result' was True. However, 'z' does not inversely influence the computation or value of 'result'; this relationship is not fully deterministic without knowledge of potential other code functionalities or errors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
