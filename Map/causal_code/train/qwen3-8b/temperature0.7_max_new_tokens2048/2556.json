  "Explanation": "An increase in the number of people carrying umbrellas only directly indicates an increase in rainfall, not necessarily a decrease in temperature, because other factors (like random weather changes or external interventions) could increase rainfall or people might carry umbrellas for reasons other than rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
