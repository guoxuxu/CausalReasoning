  "Problem": "def compute_stats(data): \n    mean = sum(data) / len(data) \n    data_squared = [x**2 for x in data] \n    mean_of_squares = sum(data_squared) / len(data) \n    variance = mean_of_squares - mean**2 \n    return mean, variance\",\n\nIf the variance calculated is zero, can we conclude that all elements in 'data' are the same?",
  "Explanation": "A variance of zero means that the squared difference between each data point and the mean is zero, which indicates that all data points are equal to the mean, and thus the same.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
