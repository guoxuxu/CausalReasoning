  "Explanation": "Setting the 'promotion_flag' to True triggers the condition within the function to apply a discount to the price, which alters the 'final_price' that multiplies with the volume to determine 'sales'. Thus, sales value changes depending on the promotion flag.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
