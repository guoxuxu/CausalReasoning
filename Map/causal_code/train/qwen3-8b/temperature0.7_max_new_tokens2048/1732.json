  "Explanation": "The method 'applyDiscount' reduces 'totalSales' by a percentage amount defined by 'discountRate'. With unchanged 'numTransactions' but reduced 'totalSales', the 'calculateAverageSale' method yields a lower average sale amount. Thus we demonstrate a direct intervention (applying a discount) that affects the outcome (average sale amount) from cause (discount application) to effect (change in average sale).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
