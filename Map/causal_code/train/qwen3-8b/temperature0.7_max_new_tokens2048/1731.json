  "Explanation": "The increase in 'totalSales' could be influenced by higher value transactions and not necessarily more transactions. Without knowing the amounts involved in each transaction or whether discount was applied, it's impossible to determine just from 'totalSales' if 'numTransactions' has increased, thus showing the limitations of inferring causal direction from effect to cause without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
