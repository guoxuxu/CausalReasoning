  "Explanation": "Multiplying 'data_input' by a higher factor (20 instead of 10) increases 'adjusted_data' more dramatically. Consequently, it becomes more likely to exceed the threshold of 50, making it more probable to print 'Value is above threshold.' because 'result' will more frequently be 'High'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
