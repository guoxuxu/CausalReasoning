  "Problem": "def adjust_temperature(current_temperature, desired_temperature):\n    if current_temperature < desired_temperature:\n        return 'increase', desired_temperature - current_temperature\n    elif current_temperature > desired_temperature:\n        return 'decrease', current_temperature - desired_temperature\n    else:\n        return 'maintain', 0\n\ndef control_system(temperature_reading, set_point):\n    action, adjustment = adjust_temperature(temperature_reading, set_point)\n    if action == 'increase':\n        heating_system(adjustment)\n    elif action == 'decrease':\n        cooling_system(adjustment)\n    else:\n        maintain_temperature()\n\ndef heating_system(degrees):\n    print(f'Heating by {degrees} degrees.')\n\ndef cooling_system(degrees):\n    print(f'Cooling by {degrees} degrees.')\n\ndef maintain_temperature():\n    print('Temperature is optimal.')\",\n\nIf an intervention changes the set point temperature in the control system to match the current reading, will the system stabilize without further action?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the set point to match the current temperature will result in 'adjust_temperature' returning 'maintain', 0. Consequently, 'control_system' will call 'maintain_temperature', thereby stabilizing the system without further action.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
