  "Problem": "class Calculator { int a; int b; Calculator(int x, int y) { a = x; b = y; } int multiply() { return a * b; } void updateValues(int x, int y) { a = x; b = y; } int add() { return a + b; } }\",\n\nIf the multiply method returns a smaller value than before, did the value of a or b decrease?",
  "Explanation": "In the absence of intervention, a smaller output from the multiply method directly implies a decrease in either a or b (since multiplication of two numbers decreases if one or both operands decrease assuming both are non-negative), signaling a causal relationship from the inputs to the output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
