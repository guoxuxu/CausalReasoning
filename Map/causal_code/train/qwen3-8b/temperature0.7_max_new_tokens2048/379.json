  "Explanation": "When advertising is set to 0, demand does not get the additional increase of 20 units, potentially reducing the overall demand. Thus, even if the price is increased, the change in sales might not be proportionate compared to scenarios where advertising is greater than 50.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
