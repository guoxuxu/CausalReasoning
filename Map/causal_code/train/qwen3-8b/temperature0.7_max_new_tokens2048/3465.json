  "Explanation": "Although changing the diet to good certainly reduces the risk factor related to diet, it does not incorporate or isolate effects due to other activities such as exercising habits. Thus, it cannot be conclusively said that the diet was the solely responsible factor for the initial high risk.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
