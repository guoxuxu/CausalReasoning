  "Explanation": "Suppose we intervene and discover a specific discounted price of 85. Given the original discount of 15%, this would reverse calculate to a base price of exactly 100 before discount (since 85 is 85% of 100). To have the base price at exactly 100 despite the existence of a random_increase function, we must have intervened to set the random increase to zero, eliminating its effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
