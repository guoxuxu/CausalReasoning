  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(principal, rate, years):\n    if principal < 0 or rate <= 0 or years <= 0:\n        return 'Invalid input'\n    interest = principal * (rate / 100) * years\n    total_amount = principal + interest\n    return total_amount\n\namount = 1000\ndeposit_rate = 5\ninvestment_period = 10\nfinal_amount = calculate_interest(amount, deposit_rate, investment_period)\",\n\nDoes changing the 'deposit_rate' affect 'final_amount'?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'final_amount' is calculated using the function 'calculate_interest', which includes 'deposit_rate' in its computation of 'interest'. When 'deposit_rate' is increased, the 'interest' calculated would be higher, thus increasing 'final_amount'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
