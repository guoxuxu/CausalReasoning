  "Explanation": "Without intervention but just by back-tracing from 'Temperate' status, it suggests that neither the extreme conditions for 'Tropical' nor 'Arid' were met, indicating temperatures and humidity are moderate, implicitly falling within the lines that are neither too high nor too low as per the conditionals stated.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
