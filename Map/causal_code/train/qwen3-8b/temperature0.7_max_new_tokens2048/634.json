  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data and data['age'] > 18:\n        data['adult'] = True\n        if data['income'] > 50000:\n            data['tax_bracket'] = 'high'\n        else:\n            data['tax_bracket'] = 'low'\n    else:\n        data['adult'] = False\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'none'\n    return data\",\n\nIf the 'adult' field in the output is False, can we infer that the 'age' field in the input was not greater than 18?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'adult' is only set to True when 'age' is greater than 18, its being False either indicates 'age' less than or equal to 18, or 'age' missing.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
