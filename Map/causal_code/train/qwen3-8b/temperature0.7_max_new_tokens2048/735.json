  "Problem": "def process(data, flag):\n    if flag:\n        result = sum(data) + 10\n    else:\n        result = sum(data) - 5\n    return result\n\ndata = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nflag = True\noutput = process(data, flag)\nprint(output)\",\n\nIf we adjust the 'output' to be less than originally observed, can we conclude adapting 'flag' from True to False was the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Adjusting the output to be less does not directly imply that changing 'flag' from True to False was the intervention made, as the decrease in output might also be due to changes in the data elements (reducing the individual values in 'data' or the number of items). Without control over the 'data', the direct causation solely attributed to 'flag' can't be confirmed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
