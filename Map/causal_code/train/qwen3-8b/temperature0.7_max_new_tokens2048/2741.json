  "Explanation": "An intervention that increases the final price can be performed by either increasing the base price, decreasing the discount rate, or increasing the tax rate. Therefore, an increase in the final price through intervention does not definitively mean that the base price was the factor altered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
