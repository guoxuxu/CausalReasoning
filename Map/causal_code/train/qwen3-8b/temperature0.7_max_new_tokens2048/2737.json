  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { \n  int temperature; \n  bool isRainy; \n\n  WeatherSimulator(int temp, bool rainy) { \n    temperature = temp; \n    isRainy = rainy; \n  } \n\n  void updateWeather(int newTemp, bool newRain) { \n    temperature = newTemp; \n    isRainy = newRain; \n  } \n\n  bool checkFreezing() { \n    if (isRainy && temperature < 0) { \n      return true; \n    } \n    return false; \n  } \n}\",\n\nIf 'checkFreezing' returns false, by intervening and setting 'isRainy' and 'temperature' external to 'updateWeather', can 'checkFreezing' be influenced to return true?",
  "Explanation": "Manipulating the environmental variables ('isRainy' and 'temperature') outside of the regular update mechanism ('updateWeather') to set 'isRainy' to true and 'temperature' to below zero allows the simulation of freezing conditions, thus 'checkFreezing' would then return true. This demonstrates intervention to trace effects back to manipulated causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
