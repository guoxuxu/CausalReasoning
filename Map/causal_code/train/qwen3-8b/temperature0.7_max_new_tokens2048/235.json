  "Explanation": "By maintaining temperature above zero, the only condition left for umbrella usage driven by the function willPeopleUseUmbrellas() depends on whether it is raining. Since the artificial maintenance of temperature eliminates the freezing condition, any instance of rain will logically result in people using umbrellas.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
