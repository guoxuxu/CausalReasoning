  "Explanation": "Decreasing the fuel_level alone does not directly affect the speed of the car. The speed would only be affected during acceleration if the fuel level is below 5. The code shows the car can still accelerate at half the rate when the engine is running even if fuel is low, but below this threshold, it doesn't directly cause a deceleration.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
