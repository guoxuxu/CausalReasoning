  "Problem": "See above\",\n\nIf we introduce a new filtering function that also removes outliers from the data, and then calculate the average, will the result be more reliable?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a reliable outlier removal step before calculating the average minimizes the impact of extreme values, potentially leading to a more representative average, assuming outliers are defined correctly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
