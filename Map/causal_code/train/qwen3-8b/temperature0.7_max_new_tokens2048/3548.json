  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data:\n        age = data['age']\n        if age > 30:\n            data['discount'] = 0.2\n        else:\n            data['discount'] = 0.1\n    if 'new_customer' in data and data['new_customer']:\n        data['discount'] += 0.05\n    return data\",\n\nIf the system is modified to increase the discount by an extra 0.05 to everyone over the age of 30, will someone who is 35 have a discount of at least 0.25?",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention to increase discount by an extra 0.05 for everyone over 30, a 35 years old, initially receiving a 0.2 discount, will now receive 0.25 (0.2 initial + 0.05 increase). This question bridges an understanding that a direct cause (age over 30) with an additional intervention (extra discount) results in an effect (total discount of 0.25).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
