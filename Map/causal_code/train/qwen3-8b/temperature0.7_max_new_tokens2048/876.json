  "Explanation": "The password being incorrect prevents login, resulting in 'login failed' which maps to 'no action' in perform_action(). 'Delete database' only occurs if user_type is 'admin', which requires successful admin login (correct password for the admin).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
