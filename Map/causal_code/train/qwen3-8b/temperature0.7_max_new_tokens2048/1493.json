  "Problem": "Code provided above\",\n\nWould adjusting the feedback score of an item and then checking the price demonstrate a direct effect of the feedback score on price setting with intervention?",
  "Explanation": "By manually setting a new feedback score, the price adjustment is triggered. Observing the price change afterwards confirms that price adjustment is directly related to feedback, representing an intervention-based effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
