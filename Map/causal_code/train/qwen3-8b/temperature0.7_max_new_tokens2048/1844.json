  "Explanation": "The 'stop_engine' method explicitly sets 'engine_on' to False and 'speed' to 0. An automatic system that turns off the engine when speed is 0 would be redundant in this scenario because the engine is already turned off by the method itself, thus the intervention does not change the 'engine_on' status post-method call.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
