  "Explanation": "A higher result reflects a high sum of filtered_data. However, this does not necessarily mean that the original data had high values exclusively; it is determined by the combination of the values above the filter threshold and the set threshold itself. Lower threshold settings could include a greater quantity of moderately high values, contributing to a higher result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
