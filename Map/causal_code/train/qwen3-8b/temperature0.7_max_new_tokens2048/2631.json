  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data:\n        data['age_category'] = 'adult' if data['age'] >= 18 else 'child'\n    data['has_discount'] = True if data.get('loyalty_points', 0) > 100 else False\n    if data['has_discount']:\n        data['discount_percentage'] = 20\n    else:\n        data['discount_percentage'] = 0\n    return data\",\n\nIf the age_category is 'adult', can we conclude the person's age is 18 or older?",
  "Explanation": "Given the logic in the code, 'adult' is only assigned to 'age_category' if the age is 18 or more. Therefore, if we observe 'adult' for 'age_category', the age must be 18 or older.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
