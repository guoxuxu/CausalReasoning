  "Explanation": "Intervening the system to be 'stable' does not equate to an exact temperature set unless other context is provided. 'Stable' generally means it is not in a 'danger', 'warning', 'critical', or 'caution' state, thus it could be any value not leading to those other states. Temperature settings like 31 would still result in 'stable' status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
