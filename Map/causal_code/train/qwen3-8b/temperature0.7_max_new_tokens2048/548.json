  "Problem": "def compute_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == '20OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == '10OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.1\n    return total - discount\",\n\nIf the final payable amount is significantly less than expected, can we conclude that a '20OFF' coupon code was definitely used?",
  "Explanation": "While using a '20OFF' coupon code reduces the payable amount, concluding that it was definitely used is not certain. The reduced payable amount could also be due to other potential changes such as pricing errors, misreported quantities, or even a different coupon code providing a similar or larger discount. The causality can't be determined without other information validating the use of the specific coupon.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
