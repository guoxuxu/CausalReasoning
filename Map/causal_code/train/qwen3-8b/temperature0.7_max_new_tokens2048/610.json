  "Explanation": "Lower final_prices could indeed be influenced by a higher loyalty score which results in higher discount rates. However, it is not the only possible explanation - the original prices themselves could have been lower, or the computation logic in the code could potentially be modified elsewhere. Without explicit knowledge of the loyalty score or discount rates, a definitive causal inference cannot be made.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
