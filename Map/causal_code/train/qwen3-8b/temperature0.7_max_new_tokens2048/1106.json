  "Problem": "def calculate_health(diet_quality, exercise_freq):\n    if diet_quality > 7 and exercise_freq >= 3:\n        health_status = 'Excellent'\n    elif diet_quality > 5 or exercise_freq >= 2:\n        health_status = 'Good'\n    else:\n        health_status = 'Poor'\n    return health_status\",\n\nIf we enforce exercise_freq to 4 times a week, will this guarantee a health_status of 'Excellent' regardless of diet_quality?",
  "Explanation": "While increasing exercise_freq improves the likelihood, 'Excellent' health_status still requires diet_quality to be greater than 7. Exercise alone does not suffice without proper diet.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
