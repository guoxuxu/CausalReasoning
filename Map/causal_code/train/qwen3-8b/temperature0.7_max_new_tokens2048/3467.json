  "Explanation": "While it is true that wearing a 'formal shirt' corresponds to the activity of visiting a museum, which is linked to the weather being 'rainy', it is possible for someone to wear a 'formal shirt' in a different context not captured by our function. Therefore, while the 'formal shirt' significantly suggests rainy weather in this scenario, it does not conclusively indicate it without understanding other possible influences.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
