  "Explanation": "Decreasing product inventory alone (e.g., products expiring or getting lost) does not necessarily increase sales. Sales increase is strictly tied to actual transaction quantities, not just inventory reduction.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
