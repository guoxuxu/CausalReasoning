  "Problem": "class Employee { constructor(name, isManager) { this.name = name; this.isManager = isManager; this.salary = isManager ? 5000 : 3000; } updateSalary(increment) { if (this.isManager) { this.salary += increment * 1.2; } else { this.salary += increment; } } reportIssue() { if (!this.isManager) { return 'issue reported'; } else { return 'resolve issue directly'; } } }\",\n\nIf the property `isManager` is set to true, will the salary always initialize to 5000?",
  "Explanation": "In the provided code, `this.salary` is determined directly by the value of `isManager` during object instantiation in the constructor. If `isManager` is true, the salary is set to 5000 as per the ternary operation provided in the constructor.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
