  "Explanation": "Forcibly setting the status to 'failed' is an intervention that disconnects the natural causality between the input data containing 'error' and the status. Therefore, the status being 'failed' would not reliably indicate the presence of 'error' in the input, as it is overridden by the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
