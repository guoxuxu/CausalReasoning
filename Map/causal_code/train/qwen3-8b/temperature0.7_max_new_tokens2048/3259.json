  "Explanation": "A change in `healthStatus` could be the result of updating either `hasHealthyDiet`, `exercisesRegularly`, or both. Thus, observing a change in `healthStatus` alone does not specifically imply that `exercisesRegularly` was updated. Information about the diet or other interventions is also required to draw such a conclusion.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
