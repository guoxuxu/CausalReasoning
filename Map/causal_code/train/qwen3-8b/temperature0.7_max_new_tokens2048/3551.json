  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    modified_data = data * 2\n    final_data = modified_data + 100\n    return final_data\n\ndata = 50\nresult = process_data(data)\nprint(result)\",\n\nDoes higher 'result' imply higher original 'data'?",
  "Explanation": "Since the output 'result' is a function of the input 'data' scaled up and incremented (result = 2*data + 100), any increase in 'result' implies that 'data' was higher. No other factors affect 'result' in the given code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
