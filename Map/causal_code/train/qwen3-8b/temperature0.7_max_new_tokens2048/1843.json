  "Explanation": "Given the intervention where 'engine_on' is manually set to True and 'accelerate' is then called, the 'speed' will indeed increase by 10, as per the logic specified in 'accelerate'. The method's effect is directly linked to the engine being on, validating the speed increment post-intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
