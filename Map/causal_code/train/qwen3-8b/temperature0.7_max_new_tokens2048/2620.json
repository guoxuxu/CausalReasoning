  "Problem": "class ProductSales { constructor(price, discount) { this.price = price; this.discount = discount; this.finalPrice = this.calculateFinalPrice(); } calculateFinalPrice() { return this.price - (this.price * this.discount); } updatePrice(newPrice) { this.price = newPrice; this.finalPrice = this.calculateFinalPrice(); } updateDiscount(newDiscount) { this.discount = newDiscount; this.finalPrice = this.calculateFinalPrice(); } } const product = new ProductSales(100, 0.2); product.updatePrice(120); product.updateDiscount(0.25);\",\n\nIf you were to control the discount rate, applying a zero discount, would a price increase always result in a final price increase?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the discount to zero effectively removes the reduction factor from the final price calculation. Therefore, any increase in the price directly increases the final price, as there is no discount to mitigate the increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
