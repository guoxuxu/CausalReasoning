  "Explanation": "Setting the user's status to 'offline' manually does not trigger any actions within the code to record a 'logout' action. Actions are recorded based only on the input action parameter. Intervention in the user's status does not change database behavior regarding the recording of user activities.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
