  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, base_demand, economy_boost):\n    if discount >= 20:\n        demand_increase = 15\n    elif discount >= 10:\n        demand_increase = 10\n    else:\n        demand_increase = 5\n\n    adjusted_demand = base_demand + demand_increase\n    if economy_boost:\n        adjusted_demand *= 1.1\n\n    revenue = adjusted_demand * (price * (1 - (discount / 100)))\n    return revenue\",\n\nIf the 'revenue' increased significantly while the 'price' remained constant, did the 'base_demand' increase?",
  "Explanation": "With a constant price, a significant increase in revenue indicates an increase in the total units sold, which can be attributed to an increase in adjusted_demand. Since 'economy_boost' and 'discount' are not specified as changed, the likely factor contributing to the increase in demand would be the 'base_demand'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
