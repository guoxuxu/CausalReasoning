  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    cleaned_data = clean(data)\n    validated_data = validate(cleaned_data)\n    results = analyze(validated_data)\n    return results\n\n def clean(data):\n    # Remove invalid entries\n    return [d for d in data if d['value'] > 0]\n\n def validate(data):\n    # Check data integrity\n    return [d for d in data if 'value' in d]\n\n def analyze(data):\n    # Analyze the data and produce results\n    average = sum(d['value'] for d in data) / len(data)\n    return {'average_value': average}\",\n\nIs the validity of data entries a direct cause of the results produced by the function 'analyze'?",
  "Explanation": "The 'validate' function directly affects which data entries are considered for analysis by filtering out entries that do not meet specific criteria (presence of the 'value' key). This filtering directly influences the dataset input to 'analyze', and accordingly, the results produced. The integrity and applicateness of data are directly linked to the results, marking a cause-to-effect relationship without direct intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
