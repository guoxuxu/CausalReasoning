  "Explanation": "A decrease in the store's rating can result from lowering either the product quality, the customer service, or both. Without specific information about the intervention's impact on each parameter, one cannot solely attribute the decrease to product quality changes.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
