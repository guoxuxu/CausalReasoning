  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(a, b, x):\n    c = a + b\n    if x > 0:\n        d = c * x\n    else:\n        d = c - x\n    return d\n\na = 5\nb = 3\nx = 2\nd = compute_metrics(a, b, x)\",\n\nIf we set 'a' to a higher value while keeping 'b' and 'x' constant, will 'd' definitely increase?",
  "Explanation": "By fixing 'b' and 'x' and only increasing 'a', the only variable affecting 'c' is 'a'. Since 'c' is 'a+b' and both 'b' and 'x' are constant, an increase in 'a' results directly in an increase in 'c', and in turn, since 'x > 0', increases 'd' which is 'c*x'. Thus, with no other changes, increasing 'a' will increase 'd'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
