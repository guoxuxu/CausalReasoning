  "Explanation": "While 'winter' causes 'snowy' weather, which in turn causes the population to be 'sluggish', this is not the only path for a population to feel sluggish. Other factor interventions or errors in other systems could also potentially lead to a sluggish mood, not necessarily controlled by winter alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
