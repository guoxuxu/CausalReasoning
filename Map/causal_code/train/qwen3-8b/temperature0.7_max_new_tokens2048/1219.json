  "Problem": "Python code provided above\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in wildlife population, can we infer policies were enacted?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in wildlife population can be influenced by both a different initial level of pollution and the enactment of policies. Since the wildlife population can increase or decrease due to changes in pollution (handled in 'increase_pollution' method), without exclusive information about pollution levels or direct observation of policy enactment, it's not definitive to infer that policies were enacted just from an increase in wildlife population.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
