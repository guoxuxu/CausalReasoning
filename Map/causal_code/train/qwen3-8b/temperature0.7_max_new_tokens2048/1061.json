  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data:\n        data['adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n    if 'income' in data and data['adult']:\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'high' if data['income'] > 100000 else 'low'\n    return data\",\n\nIf the tax_bracket is determined to be 'high', can we infer the person's age?",
  "Explanation": "While the tax bracket being 'high' does suggest that the person has a high income, it relies on the condition that the person is an adult; however, the exact age beyond being at least 18 cannot be determined just from the tax bracket.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
