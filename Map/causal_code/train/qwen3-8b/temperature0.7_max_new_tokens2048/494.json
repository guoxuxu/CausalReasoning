  "Explanation": "While the function decides on an umbrella when it's rainy, the lack of information about modifications to the environment or overrides in deciding to take an umbrella indirectly doesn't strictly imply it rained; external factors might also set 'take_umbrella' to True.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
