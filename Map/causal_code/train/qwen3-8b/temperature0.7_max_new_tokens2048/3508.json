  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\n    x = input_data['temperature']\n    y = input_data['humidity']\n    if x > 30:\n        z = x * 0.9\n    else:\n        z = x * 1.1\n    w = y / 2\n    result = z + w\n    return result\",\n\nIf humidity is manually set to zero, will an increase in temperature always increase the result?",
  "Explanation": "With humidity set to zero, the variable w in the formula would be zero. Therefore, any contribution to the result solely depends on z, which is directly proportional to temperature (either 0.9 or 1.1 times depending on whether temperature is above or below 30). Therefore, an increase in temperature directly increases z, and thus the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
