  "Explanation": "A high rain likelihood could occur under two specific conditions: low temperature with relatively high humidity, or a temperature at or above 10 degrees with very high humidity (over 80%). Therefore, one cannot simply infer temperature based values solely from high rain likelihood.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
