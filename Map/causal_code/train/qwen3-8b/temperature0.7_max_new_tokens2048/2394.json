  "Explanation": "Given the scenario where an ElectricVehicle starts returning 'Driving!' after 'Out of fuel!' outputs, the most plausible explanation under the provided code is that the charge() method was called, especially if no fuel refill intervention is mentioned for regular vehicles.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
