  "Explanation": "Setting the humidity to 50% simplifies the relation as this optimal level of humidity positively influences the comfort index formula used in 'adjusted_temp'. Thus, with this intervention, increasing the temperature will consistently increase the 'comfort_index', and since the humidity is controlled and kept at an optimal level, this will likely make the 'is_comfortable' more easily achievable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
