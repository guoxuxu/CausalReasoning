  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    if flag == 'A':\n        result = sum(data) + 10\n    elif flag == 'B':\n        result = max(data) - 5\n    else:\n        result = min(data) * 2\n    return result\",\n\nIf the 'flag' variable is set to 'A', will the function always return a value greater than the sum of 'data'?",
  "Explanation": "Without any intervention, setting the 'flag' to 'A' causes the function process_data to return the sum of the elements in 'data' plus 10. Thus, the result is always greater than the sum of 'data'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
