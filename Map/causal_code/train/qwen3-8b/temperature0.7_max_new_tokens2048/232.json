  "Explanation": "Even with the intervention, a high result does not necessarily indicate that inputB was high. The increase in result can be largely attributed to the augmentation of inputA by 10 units. This adjustment alone can significantly raise the result depending on inputA's initial value, making it insensitive to changes in inputB.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
