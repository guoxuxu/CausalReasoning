  "Explanation": "The `is_engine_on` method checks if `engine_status` is 'on', regardless of whether this was set by `start_engine` or an external method. Hence, it would return 'true' if `engine_status` were set to 'on' by any means.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
