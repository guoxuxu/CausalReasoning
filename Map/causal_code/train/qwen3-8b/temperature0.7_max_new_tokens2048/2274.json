  "Problem": "{\n        \"Description\": \"A software module for a content management system where posts by users are automatically categorized based on keywords and tagged by sentiment before being published. The sentiment tagging can occasionally fail due to API timeouts.\",\n        \"Code\": \"def categorize_post(post):\n    keywords = extract_keywords(post.content)\n    category = determine_category(keywords)\n    return category\n\ndef tag_sentiment(post):\n    try:\n        sentiment = sentiment_analysis_api(post.content)\n    except TimeoutError:\n        sentiment = 'Unknown'\n    post.sentiment = sentiment\n    return sentiment\n\ndef publish_post(post):\n    category = categorize_post(post)\n    sentiment = tag_sentiment(post)\n    database.save(post.category, post.sentiment, post.content)\n    return 'Post Published'\"\n    },\n\nIf there is an observed decrease in the number of posts with incorrect categories, can this be attributed to improvements in the sentiment analysis API?",
  "Explanation": "Categorization is determined by keywords and is independent of the sentiment analysis. Improvements in the sentiment analysis API would not affect the keyword extraction or determination of categories, which means category errors and their rectifications are unrelated to sentiment analysis performance.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
