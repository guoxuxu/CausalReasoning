  "Explanation": "The evaluateComfort() function first calls updateTemperature(), which, if the temperature is initially above 25 degrees, decreases the temperature by 2 degrees. Then the methodology in evaluateComfort() checks if temperature is still over 22 degrees to qualify as 'Hot'. Therefore, initially, it was likely above 25 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
