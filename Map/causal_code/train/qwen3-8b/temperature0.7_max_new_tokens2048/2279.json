  "Explanation": "When the external temperature decreases to less than 18 degrees, the condition in the 'update_temperature' method will trigger the heater to turn on (self.heater_on = True). Consequently, the internal temperature will increase by 2 degrees. Therefore, a decrease in external temperature directly causes an increase in internal temperature without any interventions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
