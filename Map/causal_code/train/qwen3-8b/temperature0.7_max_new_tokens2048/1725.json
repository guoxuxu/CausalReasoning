  "Explanation": "If the external temperature drops yet the room temperature remains steady, one plausible explanation given the code's functionality is that the heater was turned on to counteract the cooling effect of the external temperature drop, assuming no other sources of heat and no significant delay in temperature adjustment (intervention to maintain steady room temperature).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
