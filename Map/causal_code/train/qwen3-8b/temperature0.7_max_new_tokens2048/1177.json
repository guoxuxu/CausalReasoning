  "Problem": "def market_behavior(company_sales, economic_growth):\n    if economic_growth > 3:\n        company_sales *= 1.1\n    else:\n        company_sales *= 0.9\n    company_sales -= 100  # constant operating costs\n    return company_sales\",\n\nIf company sales see an increase, does it imply that the economic growth was above 3%?",
  "Explanation": "While higher economic growth leads to increased sales, an increase in sales could be influenced by other external factors or initial higher sales before any change due to economic conditions. Therefore, just an increase in sales alone cannot confirm that the economic growth was above 3%.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
