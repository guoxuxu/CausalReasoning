  "Problem": "def process_data(data, mode):\n    if mode == 'normalize':\n        max_val = max(data)\n        return [x / max_val for x in data]\n    elif mode == 'standardize':\n        mean_val = sum(data) / len(data)\n        std_dev = (sum((x - mean_val) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)) ** 0.5\n        return [(x - mean_val) / std_dev for x in data]\n    else:\n        return data\",\n\nIf a list of all ones is returned, can we conclude the input data was manipulated to be the same for each element?",
  "Explanation": "Although manipulating all input data values to be the same can result in a list of all ones after normalization, this is not the only scenario resulting in a uniform list. For instance, outputting the original data (mode being neither 'normalize' nor 'standardize') can also return a list of all ones if the original data was already uniform.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
