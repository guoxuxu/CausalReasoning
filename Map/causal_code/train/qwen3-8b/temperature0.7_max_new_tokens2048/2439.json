  "Problem": "def sales_discount(prices, discount_rate=0.1): \n    discounted_prices = [] \n    for price in prices: \n        if price >= 50: \n            new_price = price - price * discount_rate \n            discounted_prices.append(new_price) \n        else: \n            discounted_prices.append(price) \n    return discounted_prices\",\n\nIf the list 'prices' contains only values above 50, will 'discounted_prices' contain values lower than 'prices'?",
  "Explanation": "Since all prices are above 50, each price will be subject to a discount calculated by subtracting 10% of the original. This reduces each individual price, resulting in 'discounted_prices' containing lower values than the original 'prices'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
