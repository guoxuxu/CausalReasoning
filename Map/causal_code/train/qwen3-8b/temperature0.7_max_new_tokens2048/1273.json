  "Explanation": "Even with a high heart rate, if 'isSleeping' is set to true, the method prioritizes the sleep status and returns 'Resting'. This shows the overriding effect of the 'isSleeping' variable when set, irrespective of heart rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
