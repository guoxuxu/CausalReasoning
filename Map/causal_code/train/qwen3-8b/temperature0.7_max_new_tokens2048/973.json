  "Explanation": "While an increase in the variance of 'e' would increase the variance in 'y', the reverse is not necessarily true. Increases in variance of 'y' could also arise from changes in 'x' or even from other unobserved factors in the environment. Therefore, increase in variance of 'y' alone cannot conclusively indicate the cause as the increase of 'e'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
