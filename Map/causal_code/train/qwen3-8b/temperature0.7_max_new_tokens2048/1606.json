  "Explanation": "Given the disease conditions (age over 50 and pollution level over 75), if an intervention results in an elderly person without a disease, it implies that the intervention successfully reduced the pollution below the necessary threshold.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
