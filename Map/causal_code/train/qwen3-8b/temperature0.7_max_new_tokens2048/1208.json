  "Explanation": "In the absence of the grow_rabbits function which normally increases rabbit population, the only remaining interaction affecting rabbits is their consumption by foxes in the grow_foxes function, which leads to a decline.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
