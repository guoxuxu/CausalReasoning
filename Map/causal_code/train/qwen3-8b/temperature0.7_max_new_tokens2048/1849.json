  "Problem": "int processOrder(int quantity, bool isMember) { if (isMember) { return quantity * 2; } else { return quantity; } }\",\n\nIf a user increases the quantity of an order, will the resultant order value increase without membership status changing?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the quantity directly increases the returned value of the function processOrder (either doubled or not based on membership), with the membership status unchanged. The function directly multiplies the input quantity by 2 if the user is a member, otherwise it returns the quantity as is.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
