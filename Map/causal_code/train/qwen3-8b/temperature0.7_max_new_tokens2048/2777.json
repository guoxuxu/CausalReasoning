  "Explanation": "Manually changing the weather status to 'sunny' decouples the natural relationship between temperature and weather status as depicted in the code. Therefore, we cannot conclude about the natural state of the temperature just from the intervention-based weather status. It might be 'sunny' due to manual change rather than natural causes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
