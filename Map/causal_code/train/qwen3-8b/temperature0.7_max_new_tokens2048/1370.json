  "Explanation": "The feedback system uses the condition provided by 'Comfortable' indicating the temperature was between 19 and 22 degrees after running updateTemperature(). Given the maximum increase is 3 degrees, the highest initial temperature would be 19 degrees, which is below 23 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
