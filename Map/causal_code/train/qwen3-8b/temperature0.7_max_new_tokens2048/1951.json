  "Explanation": "An external intervention that increases or decreases the 'age' attribute of items in `data` will directly impact which items are filtered based on the age condition set in `processed_data`. This is an example of an intervention impacting the causal flow from cause (`data`) to effect (`processed_data`).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
