  "Problem": "def illness_probability(age, symptom_flag): \n    if age > 50: \n        risk = 0.4 \n    else: \n        risk = 0.2 \n    if symptom_flag: \n        risk += 0.3 \n    return risk\",\n\nIf a person is older than 50 and shows symptoms, would the risk be higher than a younger person without symptoms?",
  "Explanation": "From cause to effect without intervention - Age and symptoms directly increase the risk without any external intervention, and combining both factors (being over 50 and having symptoms) maximizes the risk according to the code logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
