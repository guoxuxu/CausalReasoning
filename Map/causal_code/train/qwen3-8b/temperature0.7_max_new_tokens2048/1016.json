  "Problem": "def calculate_health(score, age, medication):\n    base_health = 100\n    health = base_health - age + score * 10\n    if medication:\n        health += 30\n    return health\n\npatient_score = 8\npatient_age = 40\nmedication_taken = True\n\npatient_health = calculate_health(patient_score, patient_age, medication_taken)\",\n\nIf the patient had a higher score, would his calculated health be higher assuming no changes made to age or medication status?",
  "Explanation": "From cause to effect without intervention: Increasing the 'score' directly increases the 'health' because health is positively correlated with score as indicated by 'health = base_health - age + score * 10'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
