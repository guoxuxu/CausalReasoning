  "Problem": "class Calculator { constructor(initValue) { this.value = initValue; } add(x) { this.value += x; } subtract(x) { this.value -= x; } getValue() { return this.value; } } const calc = new Calculator(10); calc.add(5); calc.subtract(3); const output = calc.getValue();\",\n\nAssuming the final output was observed to be greater than initially expected, can we infer the 'subtract' operation was replaced by an 'add'?",
  "Explanation": "If the final output was unexpectedly high, one plausible explanation could be the modification or replacement of the 'subtract' operation with an 'add'. Since subtraction of a positive number reduces the total and addition increases it, observing a larger than expected output suggests additional or increased addition operations instead of subtraction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
