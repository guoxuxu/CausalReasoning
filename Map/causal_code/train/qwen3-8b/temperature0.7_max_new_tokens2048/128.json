  "Explanation": "Vehicle speed is influenced by weather, but setting an arbitrary speed does not provide a mechanism to control or adjust the weather conditions themselves. The causal relationship does not operate in reverse; weather affects speed, but not vice versa.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
