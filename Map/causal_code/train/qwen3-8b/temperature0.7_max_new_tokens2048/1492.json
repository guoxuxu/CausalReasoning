  "Problem": "Code provided above\",\n\nCan observing the new price of an item reveal its previous feedback scores without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "While changes in prices are influenced by feedback scores, the relationship is not deterministic and exclusive as other factors or previous sales may affect the price independently. Also, without knowing the original price and sales impacts, you cannot reliably determine feedback scores.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
