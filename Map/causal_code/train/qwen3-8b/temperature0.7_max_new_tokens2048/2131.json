  "Explanation": "From cause to effect without intervention: Increasing 'x' will lead to an increase in 'sum'. Given x > 0, increasing 'sum' will subsequently double the increased 'sum' value in determining 'z', thus increasing 'z'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
