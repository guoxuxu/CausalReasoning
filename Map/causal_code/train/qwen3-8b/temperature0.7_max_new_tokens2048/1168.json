  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    modified_data = data * 2 \n    final_data = modified_data + 100 \n    return final_data\n\nresult = process_data(50)\",\n\nIf the function 'process_data' is called with a value of 50, will the 'final_data' always end up being 200?",
  "Explanation": "The final_data result is calculated by first doubling the input (50 * 2 = 100) and then adding 100, which leads to a final_data result of 200. The assumed value seems correct only for this particular input, but the question implies a general rule which is false as other inputs produce different results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
