  "Explanation": "With intervention, an increase in traffic speed to 70 km/h suggests that either the trafficDensity was decreased to below 50 or it became a holiday, based on the conditions in the `calculateTrafficSpeed()` method. Both these conditions lead to a traffic speed of 70 km/h.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
