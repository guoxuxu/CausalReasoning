  "Problem": "def compute_health_scores(age, diet_quality, physical_activity_level):\n    base_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_score -= 10\n    if diet_quality < 5:\n        base_score -= 30\n    if physical_activity_level > 7:\n        base_score += 20\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf an intervention adjusts diet_quality above the threshold of 5, while keeping other factors constant, will the health score increase?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, if diet_quality is improved above 5, the condition to subtract 30 from base_score for poor diet does not execute. This leads to a higher score, assuming age and physical_activity_level are held constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
