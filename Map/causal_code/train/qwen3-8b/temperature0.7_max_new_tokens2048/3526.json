  "Problem": "class Car{\n  int speed = 0;\n  boolean engineOn = false;\n  void startEngine() {\n    engineOn = true;\n    speed = 0;\n  }\n  void stopEngine() {\n    engineOn = false;\n    speed = 0;\n  }\n  void accelerate(int increment) {\n    if (engineOn) {\n      speed += increment;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the engine is turned on, will the speed be zero?",
  "Explanation": "When the engine is started (`startEngine()` method), the `engineOn` flag is set to true, and speed is explicitly set to zero. As such, immediately after the engine is turned on, the speed remains zero unless the `accelerate` method is subsequently called.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
