  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    scaled_data = data * 10\n    result = scaled_data + 5\n    return result\n\ndata = 3\noutput = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf the final 'output' value is set to a specific value through an intervention, can we infer the original 'data' value that was used?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'output' directly does not provide information about the transformations applied on 'data' (the multiplication by 10 and the addition of 5), especially under an intervention that directly alters 'output'. Thus, original 'data' cannot be accurately inferred.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
