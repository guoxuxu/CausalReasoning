  "Problem": "class TrafficSystem { constructor() { this.trafficLight = 'green'; this.carsMoving = true; } changeLight(color) { this.trafficLight = color; if (color === 'red') { this.carsMoving = false; } else { this.carsMoving = true; } } simulateAccident() { this.carsMoving = false; } getStatus() { return `Traffic Light: ${this.trafficLight}, Cars Moving: ${this.carsMoving}`; } } const cityTraffic = new TrafficSystem(); cityTraffic.changeLight('yellow'); cityTraffic.simulateAccident(); console.log(cityTraffic.getStatus());\",\n\nDoes a change in the traffic light color (from green to red) cause the cars to stop moving?",
  "Explanation": "In the TrafficSystem class, the method changeLight(color) sets the traffic light color and directly influences the cars' movement. If the color is set to 'red', the carsMoving property is explicitly set to false, making the cars stop.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
