  "Explanation": "A growth rate of 0 could arise from any one or more conditions being below their vital threshold (water < 100, sunlight < 4, or temperature < 10 or > 30), not necessarily all conditions simultaneously.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
