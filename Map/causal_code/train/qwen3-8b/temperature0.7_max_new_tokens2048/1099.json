  "Explanation": "The code only changes the state of airConditioningOn based on its own logic within the adjustTemperature() method. If you manually set the temperature to 17 degrees without invoking adjustTemperature(), the air conditioning state remains unchanged and thus stays as it was, which in this case is presumed to be 'false' if not previously turned on.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
