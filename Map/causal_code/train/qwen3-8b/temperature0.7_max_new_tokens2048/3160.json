  "Explanation": "The `update_traffic_light` method changes the state of the traffic light. According to `car_moves`, if this updated state is 'green', it leads to an increase in car speed by 10. Therefore, manually setting the light to green intervenes and causes the car to accelerate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
