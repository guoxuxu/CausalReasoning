  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(prices, discounts, tax_rate): \n    discounted_prices = [p - (p * d) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)] \n    taxed_prices = [dp * (1 + tax_rate) for dp in discounted_prices] \n    total_sales = sum(taxed_prices) \n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf an intervention keeps the tax_rate constant but increases discounts, will this increase the total_sales?",
  "Explanation": "Keeping the tax rate constant while increasing discounts will lower the discounted prices. Since the taxed prices are calculated as discounted prices plus a constant tax rate, the increase in discounts will lead to lower taxed prices and, thus, a probable decrease in total sales. These calculations do not consider potential changes in purchasing behavior due to lower prices.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
