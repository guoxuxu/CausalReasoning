  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, coupon_code):\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == 'SAVE10':\n        discount = 10\n    elif coupon_code == 'SAVE20':\n        discount = 20\n    total_price = price - discount\n    return total_price\n\ndef main():\n    final_price = calculate_discount(100, 'SAVE10')\n    print('Final price:', final_price)\n\nmain()\",\n\nIf the total_price observed is 80, can we infer the coupon code used was 'SAVE20'?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the initial price was 100 (as seen in the 'main' function). The only scenario under the current function rules where the total_price would be 80 is if a 20-unit discount was applied, which corresponds exclusively to the coupon code 'SAVE20'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
