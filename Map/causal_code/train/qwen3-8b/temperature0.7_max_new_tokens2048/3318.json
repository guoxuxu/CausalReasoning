  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, demand, tax_rate):\n    tax = price * demand * tax_rate\n    final_sales = price * demand + tax\n    return final_sales\",\n\nIf the demand increases, will the final_sales increase assuming no intervention on price and tax_rate?",
  "Explanation": "In the original code, final_sales is calculated based on price, demand, and tax, where tax itself is a function of price, demand, and tax_rate. Increasing demand directly increases both the tax and the product of the price and demand, given the price and tax_rate are constant. Hence, the final_sales will increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
