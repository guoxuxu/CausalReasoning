  "Explanation": "The log_action method, which outputs such print statements, is only called within add_stock and remove_stock. Since the message is 'Add', it specifically indicates that add_stock was utilized to increase the stock.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
