  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'weather' in data:\n        rain = data['weather'].get('rain', 0)\n        if rain > 20:\n            traffic_delay = 1.5\n        else:\n            traffic_delay = 1.0\n    else:\n        traffic_delay = 1.0\n    if 'special_event' in data:\n        traffic_delay *= 2\n    data['traffic_delay'] = traffic_delay\n    return data\",\n\nIf traffic delay is observed to be more than usual, can we conclude there was more than 20mm of rain?",
  "Explanation": "Although heavy rain (more than 20mm) increases the traffic delay, it's not the sole cause; the presence of a special event also doubles the delay regardless of rain. Hence, increased traffic delay alone cannot conclusively indicate heavy rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
