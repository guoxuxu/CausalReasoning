  "Explanation": "In the method forecast_temperature, the temperature is calculated as self.temperature + (days_ahead * 2) - (0.1 * self.humidity). Increasing the days_ahead inherently increases the forecast temperature by 2 degrees per day, adhering to a linear relationship with no other variables being changed. Therefore, the answer is yes.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
