  "Problem": "class Experiment {\n  int temperature;\n  int pressure;\n  boolean result;\n  public Experiment(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.2); // Assumes pressure is dependent on temperature\n    this.result = this.pressure > 100; // Result is true if pressure is greater than 100\n  }\n  public void setTemperature(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.1); // Changing the dependency formula here\n    this.result = this.pressure > 110; // Also changing the threshold for result\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf we manually set the temperature to 150, will the pressure exceed 110?",
  "Explanation": "By setting the temperature to 150, after the change in temperature setting formula from `setTemperature`, the pressure becomes `150 * 1.1 = 165`, which indeed is greater than 110.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
