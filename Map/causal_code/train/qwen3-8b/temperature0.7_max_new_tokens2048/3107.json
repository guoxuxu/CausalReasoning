  "Explanation": "Adding 10 units of fuel ensures that `fuel_level` is greater than zero. According to the `start_engine` method, the engine status is set to 'on' only if there is more than 0 units of fuel. Therefore, the engine will start.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
