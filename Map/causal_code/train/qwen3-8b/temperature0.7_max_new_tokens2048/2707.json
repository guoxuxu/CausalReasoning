  "Explanation": "Increasing the amount in recordSale increases the base value on which the discount is applied. Even after applying the discount, the discounted amount is still based on the original, now higher, sales figure, which raises the total after the discount.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
