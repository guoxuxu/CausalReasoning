  "Explanation": "While an 'average' sales_performance occurs when the product price is under 300 with a 'medium' interest level, reversing the causality by decreasing the price post-observation of 'average' performance does not allow us to infer backwards about the interest level being 'medium' as other factors could also have been at play.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
