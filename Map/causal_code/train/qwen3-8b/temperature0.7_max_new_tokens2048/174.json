  "Explanation": "The output 'Add Water' indicates insufficient water, which typically suggests 'water_used' exceeded 'water_level'. However, without intervention, other possibilities like machine malfunctioning or wrong data inputs could not be ruled out, so causal inference just based on output is not definitive.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
