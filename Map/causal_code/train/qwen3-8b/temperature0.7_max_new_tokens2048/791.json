  "Problem": "Provided above\",\n\nIf the 'final_total' is significantly less after an operation, can we conclude that a higher-priced item was removed from the cart?",
  "Explanation": "A significant reduction in 'final_total' suggests that a higher-priced item was removed, as the total price is a direct sum of the prices of items in the cart. Removing a higher-priced item results in a correspondingly significant reduction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
