  "Problem": "def compute_health_risk(age, smoker, bmi): \n    risk = 0 \n    if age > 50: \n        risk += 20 \n    if smoker: \n        risk += 30 \n    if bmi > 25: \n       risk += 10 \n    return risk\",\n\nIf we implement a public policy that restricts smoking, would that affect the health risk scores calculated by our function?",
  "Explanation": "The function increases the risk score by 30 if a person is a smoker. So, a policy that effectively reduces smoking would lead to lower risk scores for individuals who would otherwise be smokers.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
