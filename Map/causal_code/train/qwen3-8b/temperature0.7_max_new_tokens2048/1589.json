  "Explanation": "Launching a new discount via launchDiscount modifies the discount, which directly affects how revenue is calculated (units_sold * (price_per_unit * (1 - discount))). This is a test of causal inference from cause to effect with an intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
