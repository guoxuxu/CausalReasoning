  "Explanation": "Reduction in score can be affected by interventions other than those on temperature, such as starting or stopping rain (changing the mood). For example, if it stops raining, and temperature remains below 20, the score still reduces from 80 to 60 if the mood shifts from 'happy' to 'sad'. This does not involve any direct modification on the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
