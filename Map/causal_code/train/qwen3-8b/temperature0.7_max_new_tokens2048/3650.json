  "Explanation": "In the function, 'adjusted_temp' is directly calculated from 'temperature' using the formula adjusted_temp = temperature * 1.8 + 32. An increase in 'temperature' directly causes an increase in 'adjusted_temp' due to the multiplication by 1.8.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
