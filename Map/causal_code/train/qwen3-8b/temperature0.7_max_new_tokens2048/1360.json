  "Problem": "\n# Hypothetical Python Program\n\nclass DataProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, base_value):\n        self.base_value = base_value\n    \n    def multiply(self, factor):\n        return self.base_value * factor\n\n    def add(self, addition):\n        total = self.base_value + addition\n        return total\n\n# Instances and function calls\nprocessor = DataProcessor(10)\nresult_multiply = processor.multiply(5)\nresult_add = processor.add(20)\nfinal_result = result_multiply + result_add\n\"\"\",\n\nIf 'final_result' is observed to be higher than usual, can it be concluded that 'base_value' was definitely increased?",
  "Explanation": "A higher 'final_result' could be due to an increase in either 'base_value', 'factor' used in 'multiply', or the addition value used in 'add'. Without additional information, we cannot conclusively say the increase in 'final_result' is solely due to an increased 'base_value'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
