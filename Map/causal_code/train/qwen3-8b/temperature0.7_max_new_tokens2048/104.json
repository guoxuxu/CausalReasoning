  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 15 degrees means all City objects with a WeatherSystem instantiated at this temperature will default to 'Rainy' according to the defined temperature thresholds in update_weather(). It's a direct intervention on the cause which programmatically sets an outcome, regardless of prior weather conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
