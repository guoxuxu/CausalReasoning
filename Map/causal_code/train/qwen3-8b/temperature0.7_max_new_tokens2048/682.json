  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'temperature' in data:\n        temperature = data['temperature']\n        if temperature > 20:\n            mood = 'happy'\n        else:\n            mood = 'sad'\n    return mood\n\nresponse = process_data({'temperature': 25})\",\n\nIf we manipulate the function parameters to ensure 'temperature' is absent, can we still expect to retrieve a 'happy' or 'sad' mood?",
  "Explanation": "The code requires that 'temperature' key exists in the data dictionary for mood to be set. If temperature is absent due to data manipulation, the function will not return 'happy' or 'sad' since mood is determined only when temperature is present. This leads to a failure of setting any mood, and likely a runtime error for returning an undefined variable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
