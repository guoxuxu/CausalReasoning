  "Explanation": "While increasing priceA does lead to decreased salesA, observing lower salesA can also result from other factors such as lower marketingA or negative daily fluctuations. Without isolating these variables, a definitive causal relationship linkage from salesA to priceA cannot be construed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
