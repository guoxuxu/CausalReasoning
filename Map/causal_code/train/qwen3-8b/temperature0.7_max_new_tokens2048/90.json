  "Explanation": "An increase in final_demand could be due to either favorable weather (sunny), a holiday that increases the base demand, or an effective marketing campaign. Since these factors are interdependent and not exclusive to sunny weather, the specific state of the weather cannot be conclusively determined from a rise in final_demand alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
