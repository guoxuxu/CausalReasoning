  "Problem": "class WeatherSystem {\n    int windSpeed = 10;\n    int airPressure = 100;\n    boolean isRaining = false;\n\n    void updateWeather(int newWindSpeed, int newAirPressure) {\n        windSpeed = newWindSpeed;\n        airPressure = newAirPressure;\n        if (windSpeed > 15 && airPressure < 95) {\n            isRaining = true;\n        } else {\n            isRaining = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf it's raining, can we conclude air pressure is below 95?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the rain condition is true as per the code, it follows that both conditions that trigger rain must be met: wind speed > 15 and air pressure < 95. Thus, if it is raining, it confirms that the air pressure is indeed below 95.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
