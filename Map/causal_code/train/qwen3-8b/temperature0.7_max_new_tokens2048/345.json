  "Explanation": "In the given code, the condition to start exercising is that the hydration level should be more than 50. If the hydration level is below 50 and no additional water is consumed, the hydration level remains insufficient for the condition isExercising = true to be met.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
