  "Problem": "def compute_final_score(base_score, bonus_points, has_bonus): \n    if has_bonus:\n        final_score = base_score + bonus_points\n    else:\n        final_score = base_score\n    return final_score\",\n\nIf the variable 'base_score' is increased, will the 'final_score' also increase, assuming no change in other variables?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'final_score' directly depends on 'base_score' plus any 'bonus_points' if 'has_bonus' is True. If 'base_score' is increased, 'final_score' will increase irrespective of 'bonus_points' or the state of 'has_bonus'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
