  "Explanation": "The function `take_medicine` reduces the patient's temperature by 2 degrees when 'antipyretic' is passed as the argument, indicating a direct intervention effect of this medicine on reducing temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
