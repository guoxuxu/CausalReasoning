  "Explanation": "Changing a light to green via the 'change_traffic_lights' method affects the car's ability to move. If the corresponding car’s light is set to green, and the car speed is set afterward, the car will move as indicated by 'car_speed' function unless another constraint applies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
