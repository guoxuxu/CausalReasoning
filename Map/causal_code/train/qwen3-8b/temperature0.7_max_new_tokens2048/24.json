  "Explanation": "While the enabling of 'apply_correction' does reduce each qualifying data element, the main driver for size reduction in 'filtered_data' when increasing 'filter_threshold' would be the threshold change itself. We cannot definitively conclude reduction in individual data element sizes due to 'apply_correction' alone caused the shorter data list, as it might be primarily due to fewer elements passing the increased threshold.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
