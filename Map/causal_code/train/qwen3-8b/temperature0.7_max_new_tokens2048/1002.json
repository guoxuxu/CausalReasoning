  "Problem": "def compute_scores(grades, bonus_enabled, penalty_enabled):\n    base_score = sum(grades) / len(grades)\n    if bonus_enabled:\n        bonus = max(grades)\n        base_score += bonus\n    if penalty_enabled:\n        penalty = min(grades)\n        base_score -= penalty\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf a decrease in `base_score` is observed upon an intervention that sets `penalty_enabled` to True, what does it indicate?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by setting `penalty_enabled` to True activates the conditional penalty code block, which subtracts the minimum grade (penalty) from the `base_score`. Decreasing the base score indicates that the penalty was applied correctly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
