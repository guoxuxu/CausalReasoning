  "Explanation": "Applying a zero discount rate simply retains the basePrice as the initial value for the finalPrice. When calculateTax is subsequently applied, the introduction of tax affects the finalPrice based on the unchanged basePrice, hence the prior application of a zero discount doesn’t alter the inevitability of a tax increase on the finalPrice.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
