  "Explanation": "While setting operation_type to 'scale' and scaling_factor to 0 would result in zero values, zero values in result alone are not conclusive evidence that these specific interventions were made. Other scenarios or operations not discussed could potentially yield the same effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
