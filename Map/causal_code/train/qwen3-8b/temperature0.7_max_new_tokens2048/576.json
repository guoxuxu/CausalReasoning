  "Problem": "def compute_health_scores(age, diet_quality, physical_activity_level):\n    base_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_score -= 10\n    if diet_quality < 5:\n        base_score -= 30\n    if physical_activity_level > 7:\n        base_score += 20\n    return base_score\",\n\nKnowing that someone has a very high health score, can we infer they definitely participate in high levels of physical activity if other factors are controlled?",
  "Explanation": "While higher physical activity (levels above 7) adds 20 points to the score and could be responsible for a high score, controlling for age and diet it is still possible to achieve a high score without high physical activity. The absence of negative impacts from age and diet alone could sustain a high score.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
