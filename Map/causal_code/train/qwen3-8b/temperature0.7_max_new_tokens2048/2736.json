  "Explanation": "Even if 'updateWeather' is not explicitly called to change the weather conditions, an external action directly lowering the 'temperature' field to a value below 0, while 'isRainy' remains true, will cause 'checkFreezing' to potentially return true. This tests the causal inference with external intervention on the temperature variable directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
