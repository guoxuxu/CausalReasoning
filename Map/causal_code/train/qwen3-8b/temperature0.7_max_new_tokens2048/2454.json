  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total_price = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == 'SAVE10' else 0.05 if coupon_code == 'SAVE5' else 0\n    discount = total_price * discount_rate\n    final_price = total_price - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final_price is observed to increase, can it be concluded that all item prices were increased?",
  "Explanation": "While increasing the item prices can lead to a higher final_price, other factors such as changes in the quantity of the items or changes in the discount rate (different coupon codes or no coupon codes) could also result in an increase in final_price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
