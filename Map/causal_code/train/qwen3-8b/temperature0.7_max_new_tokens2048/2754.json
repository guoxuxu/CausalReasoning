  "Problem": "def sales_forecast(hours_worked, ad_budget): \n  productivity = hours_worked * 0.5\n  ad_effectiveness = ad_budget * 0.3\n  total_sales = (productivity + ad_effectiveness) * 1000 \n  return total_sales\",\n\nIf the number of hours worked is increased, will that always directly increase the total sales?",
  "Explanation": "In the given function, increasing hours_worked increases productivity (hours_worked * 0.5). As productivity contributes linearly to total_sales (through the sum with ad_effectiveness and multiplication by 1000), an increase in hours worked results in an increase in total sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
