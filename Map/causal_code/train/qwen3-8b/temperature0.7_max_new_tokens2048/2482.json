  "Explanation": "Fixing the model accuracy to 0.86, regardless of the input data size, uniformly leads to a 'do not deploy' decision as this accuracy is below the threshold of 0.9 needed for deployment, rendering the original data size irrelevant under this intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
