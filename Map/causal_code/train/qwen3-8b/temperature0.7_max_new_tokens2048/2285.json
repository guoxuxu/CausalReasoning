  "Explanation": "Even if the system's count of hospitals is adjusted manually (with neither natural admissions nor discharges of critical conditions), the availability of resources should still be managed carefully to ensure readiness for new critical patients. This is beyond the code logic and reflects practical health system management considerations.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
