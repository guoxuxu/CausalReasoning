  "Explanation": "Setting days_missed to zero means that no days are subtracted due to absences, leading to no reduction in attendance days calculated in final grades. Therefore, students will benefit from their full attendance record, positively influencing their final grades, despite the fixed deduction. However, expect an overall increase even with the subtraction due to high average attendance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
