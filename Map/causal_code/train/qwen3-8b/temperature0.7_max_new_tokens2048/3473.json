  "Explanation": "A final price lower than expected could suggest several things including an increase in the discount. Altering the discount directly affects the discounted_price and thus final price; hence, a lower final price could be due to an increased discount. This analysis requires understanding reverse causality with intervention (assumptions on how other variables like base_price or tax_rate might have changed).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
