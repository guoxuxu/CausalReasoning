  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'temperature' in data:\n        temp_adjust = data['temperature'] * 1.8 + 32\n    else:\n        temp_adjust = 0\n    result = temp_adjust + 10\n    if data.get('pressure', 100) > 120:\n        result += 5\n    return result\",\n\nIf the output 'result' is greater than 15, does this imply that the 'temperature' key was necessarily present in the input data?",
  "Explanation": "A 'result' greater than 15 could also occur if 'temperature' was absent but the 'pressure' condition was met (pressure > 120) which also adds 5 to the base value of 10, potentially giving a result greater than 15 even without temperature data.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
