  "Problem": "class Store {\n  private int customers = 0;\n  private int sales = 0;\n  \n  public void enterCustomer(int number) {\n    this.customers += number;\n  }\n\n  public void makeSale(int soldItems) {\n    this.sales += soldItems;\n  }\n\n  public int getCustomers() {\n    return this.customers;\n  }\n\n  public int getSales() {\n    return this.sales;\n  }\n\n  public void promotionalEvent(int discountRate) {\n    if (discountRate > 20) {\n      this.customers += 10;\n      this.sales += 50;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf sales increase, has the number of customers necessarily increased?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing sales do not necessarily imply that more customers have entered the store. An increase in sales can occur due to the existing customers buying more items or due to effects of promotional events that increase both customers and sales regardless of the initial customer count.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
