  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, is_holiday):\n    if is_holiday:\n        discount = 0.15\n    else:\n        discount = 0.05\n\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we manipulate the final_price to be lower, can we cause it to become a holiday?",
  "Explanation": "A change in final_price is a result, not a cause. Lowering the final_price does not have an effect on the 'is_holiday' status, as this is determined by external factors unrelated to pricing operations within this function.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
