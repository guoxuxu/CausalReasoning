  "Explanation": "While an analysis_result of 'high' implies that processed_data is above 20, due to the transformation in process_data (data_sample * 2 + 5), it's not possible to pinpoint a definitive minimum data_sample value beyond implying it was at least 8, since smaller values would not reach the threshold of 20 when processed.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
