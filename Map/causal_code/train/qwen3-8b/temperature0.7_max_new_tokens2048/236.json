  "Explanation": "Given an intervention that visually checks whether umbrellas are used and confirms they are not being used, and considering the model's dependence on rain (coupled with above-zero temperatures) for umbrella use, we can conclude that it is not raining, as these conditions strictly adhere to the method's implementation in the original code.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
