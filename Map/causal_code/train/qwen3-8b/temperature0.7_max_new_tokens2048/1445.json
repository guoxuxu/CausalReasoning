  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting the random increase to 10, the base price becomes 110 before any discounts. Applying a 15% discount results in a price of 110 * 0.85, which equates to 93.5. Therefore, with this intervention, the final discounted price would indeed be consistently set to 93.5.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
