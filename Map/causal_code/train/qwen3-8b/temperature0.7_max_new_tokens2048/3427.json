  "Problem": "def calculate_health(age, smoker, exercise_freq):\n    base_health = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health -= (age - 50) * 2\n    if smoker:\n        base_health -= 30\n    if exercise_freq >= 3:\n        base_health += 20\n    return base_health\",\n\nIf a person has a low health score, is it due to them being a smoker?",
  "Explanation": "While a low health score can be influenced by other factors like age and exercise frequency, being a smoker directly reduces the health score by 30 points. Although this isn't the only cause, smoking is a significant, direct cause that lowers health, illustrating a causal pathway from 'health score' (effect) to 'smoking' (cause) without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
