  "Explanation": "The 'process_data' function checks each item in the input list to see if it is even (datum % 2 == 0). It only appends the datum multiplied by 2 to the 'processed' list if this condition is true. Providing only odd numbers means this condition is never met, hence the result will be an empty list.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
