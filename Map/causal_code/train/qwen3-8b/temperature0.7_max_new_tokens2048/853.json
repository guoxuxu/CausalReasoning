  "Explanation": "The 'sunny' weather occurs because the final temperature exceeds 30 degrees, not because the starting value is precisely 15 degrees. The starting temperature being slightly different but still resulting in a final temperature over 30 would still lead to 'sunny' weather.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
