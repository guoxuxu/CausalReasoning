  "Explanation": "Given the product price is over 50, the sales_figures increased by 200 only because the marketing budget was over 1000; with a lower budget, the increase would have been just 100.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
