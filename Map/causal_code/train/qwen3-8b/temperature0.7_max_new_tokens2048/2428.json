  "Explanation": "While a successful purchase may imply sufficient balance for that particular transaction, it does not reliably indicate the initial balance level itself, particularly when the exact price and discount are unknown.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
