  "Explanation": "The question clearly mentions that the only change is in the heart rate and it already specifies that the change was from a moderate status. Given the code, the moderate status can only be assigned if heart rate exceeds 100, as no other provided condition in this code matches for a moderate assignment due to the stipulated ages and activity levels.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
