  "Problem": "def compute_scores(data):\n    age_adjustment = data['age'] * 0.1\n    experience = data['years_of_experience'] - data['years_of_unemployment'] * 0.5\n    base_score = 70 + experience + age_adjustment\n    if data['has_degree']:\n        base_score += 15\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf 'years_of_experience' increases, do you expect 'base_score' to also increase, assuming other factors remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "More years of experience directly contribute to a higher 'experience' value in the calculation of 'base_score'. Since 'experience' is added directly to the 'base_score', increasing 'years_of_experience' increases 'base_score', assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
