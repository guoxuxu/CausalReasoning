  "Explanation": "According to the code, increasing the temperature beyond 30 degrees automatically triggers the condition that sets `isRaining` to true. Hence, if the temperature increases past this threshold, it will start raining.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
