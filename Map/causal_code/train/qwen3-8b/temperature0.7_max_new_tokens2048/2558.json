  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    double temperature = getAverageTemperature();\n    boolean isRainy = willItRain(temperature);\n    int umbrellaCount = peopleCarryingUmbrellas(isRainy);\n    displayWeatherReport(temperature, isRainy, umbrellaCount);\n  }\n\n  static double getAverageTemperature() {\n    return 20.0; // Average temperature in degrees\n  }\n\n  static boolean willItRain(double temperature) {\n    return temperature < 18.0;\n  }\n\n  static int peopleCarryingUmbrellas(boolean rainy) {\n    if (rainy) return 150;\n    else return 20;\n  }\n\n  static void displayWeatherReport(double temp, boolean rain, int umbrellas) {\n    System.out.println(\"Weather Report:\\\nTemperature: \" + temp + \" degrees\\\nRainy: \" + rain + \"\\\nUmbrellas Spotted: \" + umbrellas);\n  }\n}\",\n\nBy observing an increase in umbrella count, can we intervene and conclude that the simulator's temperature measurement function needs adjustment?",
  "Explanation": "An increased count of umbrellas directly relates to rainfall, not directly to the temperature measurement. The increase in umbrella usage could result from other factors that were not controlled, such as local events or misjudgments about the weather, not necessarily faults in temperature measurements.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
