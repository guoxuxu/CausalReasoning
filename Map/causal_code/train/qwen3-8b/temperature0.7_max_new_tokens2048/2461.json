  "Explanation": "Modifying the process_data function to multiply by 3 instead of 2 increases the output for any given data_sample. For a data_sample of 4, the original processing (4*2+5=13) would result in 'low', whereas the intervention (4*3+5=17) would still result in 'low', but the probability of hitting 'high' is closer and could be affected by this change for other values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
