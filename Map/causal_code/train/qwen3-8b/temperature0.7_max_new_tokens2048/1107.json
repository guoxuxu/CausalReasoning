  "Problem": "def calculate_health(diet_quality, exercise_freq):\n    if diet_quality > 7 and exercise_freq >= 3:\n        health_status = 'Excellent'\n    elif diet_quality > 5 or exercise_freq >= 2:\n        health_status = 'Good'\n    else:\n        health_status = 'Poor'\n    return health_status\",\n\nSuppose we observe that health_status changed from 'Good' to 'Excellent' after an intervention. Can we conclude the intervention improved diet_quality necessarily?",
  "Explanation": "The improvement might be due to an increase in either diet_quality or exercise_freq or both. Changing one of these factors or both could result in health_status improving; hence, we cannot uniquely attribute the change to diet_quality alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
