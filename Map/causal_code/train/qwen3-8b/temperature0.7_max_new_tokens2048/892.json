  "Problem": "def calculate_scores(temperature, adjustment): \n    if temperature > 20: \n        score = 70 \n        if adjustment: \n            score += 15 \n    else: \n        score = 50 \n        if adjustment: \n            score -= 10 \n    return score\",\n\nIf the temperature increases from 19 to 21 without any intervention in adjustment, will the score increase?",
  "Explanation": "When the temperature increases from below 20 to above 20, the conditional in the code shifts from the else block where the score is set at 50 to the if block where it is initially set at 70, therefore increasing the score.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
