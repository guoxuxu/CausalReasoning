  "Explanation": "While the battery level being 0 certainly leads to the robot being non-functional, a robot may also be non-functional at a battery level slightly above 0 but <= 20, as per the code logic. Hence, non-functionality does not uniquely identify the battery level as 0.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
