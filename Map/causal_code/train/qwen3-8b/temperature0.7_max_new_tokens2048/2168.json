  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    base = 5\n    data_squared = [x**2 for x in data]\n    data_multiplied = [x * base for x in data]\n    sum_squared = sum(data_squared)\n    sum_multiplied = sum(data_multiplied)\n    final_value = sum_squared + sum_multiplied\n    return final_value\",\n\nIf 'final_value' is very high, does this mean the elements of 'data' were high?",
  "Explanation": "Given the operations in the function (squaring and base multiplication), a high 'final_value' suggests high elements in 'data'. However, without knowing specifics of the base or the exact values, this is not a definitive conclusion but is likely under typical circumstances.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
