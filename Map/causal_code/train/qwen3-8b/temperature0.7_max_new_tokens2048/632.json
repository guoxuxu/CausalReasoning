  "Explanation": "The unchanged 'value' state might also be a result of an external intervention that bypasses or counteracts the effect of the 'enhance' flag. Thus, just observing unmodified 'value' fields does not conclusively determine whether the 'enhance' flag was set to False, as these values might have been modified back to their original state by the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
