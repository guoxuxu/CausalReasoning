The total sale price is calculated based on the unit price, quantity, available discounts, and whether a promotion is applied. The constructor initializes the variables and the total is calculated with these given parameters. This code exemplifies dependencies between variables such as when a promotion affects the discount applied.\"\n  },\n\nIf the calculateTotal method returns a higher value, does this indicate that the basePrice must have been increased?",
  "Explanation": "A higher return value from calculateTotal could result from several factors including an increase in quantity, an increase in basePrice, a decrease in discountRate, or the absence of any promotion (hasPromo is false). Thus, an increase in the total does not exclusively imply that the basePrice was increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
