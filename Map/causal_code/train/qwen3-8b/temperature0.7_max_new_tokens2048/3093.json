  "Explanation": "Changing the insurance premium in the function does not retroactively affect the computation of `age_squared` or `risk_factor`. These variables are determined before the insurance premium is set. The premium itself is a function of the risk factor exceeding a threshold. Adjusting the premium does not impact the causally prior calculations of age or risk factor.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
