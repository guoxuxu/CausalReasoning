  "Explanation": "When the order_status is not 'pending', no discount is applied regardless of the user_category or promo status. Therefore, changing the user_category in this scenario does not affect the discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
