  "Explanation": "After buying food, when the person then eats while being hungry, the person's state changes to not hungry. The buy_food method ensures food availability, and the eat method changes the hunger state if food is available.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
