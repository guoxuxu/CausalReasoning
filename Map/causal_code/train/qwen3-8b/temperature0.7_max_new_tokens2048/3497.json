  "Problem": "class RoomController {\n  int temperature = 20;\n  boolean heaterOn = false;\n\n  public void increaseTemp() {\n    heaterOn = true;\n    temperature += 5;\n  }\n\n  public void decreaseTemp() {\n    if (heaterOn) {\n      heaterOn = false;\n    }\n    temperature -= 3;\n  }\n\n  public String checkStatus() {\n    if (heaterOn) {\n      return \"Heater is on and temperature is \" + temperature;\n    } else {\n      return \"Heater is off and temperature is \" + temperature;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nAssuming the temperature reads 25, does this guarantee that increaseTemp() was called if an external intervention could have increased the temperature?",
  "Explanation": "While increaseTemp() would result in a temperature of 25 by setting heaterOn to true and increasing the temperature from 20 to 25, the possibility of an external intervention such as direct manipulation of the temperature variable or an external heat source implies that observing a temperature of 25 doesn't necessarily confirm increaseTemp() was called. This addresses from effect to cause with intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
