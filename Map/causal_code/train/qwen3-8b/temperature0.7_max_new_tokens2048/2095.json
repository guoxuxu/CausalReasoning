  "Explanation": "Given that the `adjust_humidity` method reduces the set humidity by 10% (multiplies by 0.9) when the temperature is above 20, observing reduced humidity relative to the input directly implies the temperature was above this threshold during the method's execution.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
