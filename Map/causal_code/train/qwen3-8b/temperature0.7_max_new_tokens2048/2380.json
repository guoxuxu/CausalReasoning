  "Explanation": "Health less than 90 can occur in both players younger than 18, due to a health reduction of 2 times the hours played, and those 18 or older, as a result of a reduction equal to the hours played. Therefore, a specific amount of health does not definitively indicate age.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
