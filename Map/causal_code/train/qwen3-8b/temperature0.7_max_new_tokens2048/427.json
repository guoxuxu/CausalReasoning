  "Explanation": "Price changes affect the price attribute directly but forecast_sales under cold conditions (temperature ≤ 20) multiplies the quantity_sold by 0.95, independent of price. Thus, increasing prices will not affect the forecast of sales in colder conditions directly.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
