  "Problem": "def process_order(user, item, discount_code=None):\n    price = item.price\n    if discount_code:\n        if verify_discount(discount_code):\n            price *= 0.9\n    if user.is_premium_member:\n        price *= 0.95\n    update_inventory(item)\n    return price\n\ndef verify_discount(code):\n    valid_codes = {'SAVE10', 'OFF20'}\n    return code in valid_codes\n\ndef update_inventory(item):\n    item.stock -= 1\",\n\nIf the final price of an item is less than the original item price, can we conclude that a valid discount code was used?",
  "Explanation": "Even though using a valid discount code reduces the price by 10%, premium members automatically receive a 5% discount regardless of discount code usage. Hence, a reduced final price can be due either to the use of a valid discount code, membership status, or both.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
