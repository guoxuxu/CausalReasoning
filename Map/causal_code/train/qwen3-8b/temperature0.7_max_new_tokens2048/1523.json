  "Explanation": "The code includes a causality where increasing steps, specifically beyond 10,000 (if newSteps > 10000), leads to a decrease in weight (this.weight -= 0.1). This happens without altering the diet intake, hence illustrating a cause (steps increase) to effect (weight decrease) without dietary intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
