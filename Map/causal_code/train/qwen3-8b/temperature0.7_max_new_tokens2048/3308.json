  "Explanation": "While setting income above 50000 increases the adjusted price by adding 20 to the base price, it could still result in prices below 80, especially for the younger age group where the base price is 50. In this case, the adjusted price would be 70.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
