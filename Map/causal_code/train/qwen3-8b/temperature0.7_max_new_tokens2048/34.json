  "Explanation": "While a higher visitors_satisfaction generally results from a higher mood, which is impacted by it being sunny, there are other factors (like temperature) that can also affect visitors_satisfaction. A high number of visitors increases satisfaction only, but this can also occur with just a 'comfortable' temperature irrespective of it being sunny. Hence, we cannot infer sunny weather purely based on high visitor satisfaction.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
