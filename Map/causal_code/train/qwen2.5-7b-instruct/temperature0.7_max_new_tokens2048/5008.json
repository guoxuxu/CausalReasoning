  "Explanation": "A decrease in budget does not necessarily imply fewer premium tickets were sold. The budget can be affected by several factors such as regular ticket sales and costs of cancellation represented in the `cancel_event` method. Without specific information on these other factors, we cannot reliably infer the sale of premium tickets from a simple reduction in budget.",
