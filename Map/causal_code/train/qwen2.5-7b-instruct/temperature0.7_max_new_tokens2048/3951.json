  "Explanation": "The label 'high' is determined by the result exceeding 50. This can occur whether the method is 'average' (average of high values can exceed 50) or 'sum' (sum of multiple values, high or even moderate, can easily exceed 50). Therefore, a 'high' label does not specify the method used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
