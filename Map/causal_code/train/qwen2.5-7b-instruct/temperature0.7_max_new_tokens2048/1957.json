  "Explanation": "In the original code, popularity is calculated as the product of views and likes. Thus, if the number of views increases, while likes remain constant or increase, the calculated popularity will also increase.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in data['views'] and data['likes'] leads to an increase in popularity, which then determines whether the result is 'High', 'Low', or 'Unknown'. An increase in data['views'] and data['likes'] can cause an increase in popularity, but this increase does not necessarily guarantee that the result will be 'High'."
