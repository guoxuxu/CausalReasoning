  "Explanation": "If 'max_speed' is set to a lower value while acceleration is in progress and the intended 'current_speed' exceeds this new lower 'max_speed', 'current_speed' will be set to this new 'max_speed'. This demonstrates the effect of intervening and adjusting the conditions under which the acceleration effect occurs.",
