  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    x = data['x']\n    y = 2 * x + data['noise']\n    z = y - data.get('adjustment', 0)\n    return {'result': z}\n\ninput_data = {'x': 5, 'noise': 3}\noutput = process_data(input_data)\",\n\nIf we set 'adjustment' in data to 10, will a change in 'x' still affect 'result'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'adjustment' to 10 changes the value of 'z' through the term 'y - adjustment'. However, since 'x' affects 'y' as 2*x + noise, changes in 'x' will continue to affect 'y', and thus 'z', even though the 'adjustment' value is set. Therefore, 'result' which is 'z' will still be affected by changes in 'x'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Changes in x directly cause changes in z, and changes in adjustment also directly cause changes in z. Therefore, even if adjustment is set to 10, a change in x will still affect result."
