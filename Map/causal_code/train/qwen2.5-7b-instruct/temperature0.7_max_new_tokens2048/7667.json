  "Explanation": "Increasing 'discount_rate' leads directly to a decrease in 'discounted_sale' for each sale over 280, since the discount applied is greater, thereby reducing the sales values and subsequently the 'average_sales_discounted'.",

  "causal_map_integration": "By increasing the discount_rate, the average_sales_discounted decreases because a higher discount rate leads to lower sales_discount values, which in turn reduces the average_sales_discounted."
