  "Explanation": "A large 'summary' value suggests that the elements in 'data' are generally larger, but it does not necessarily imply that 'flag' was False. While setting 'flag' to False results in each element being doubled, which could produce a larger sum, without knowing the original 'data' values, no direct causality can be determined linking the 'flag' state (cause) directly from the 'summary' value (effect).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
