  "Problem": "def ecosystem_model(predators, prey, resources):\n    if resources > 50:\n        prey_growth_rate = 0.1\n    else:\n        prey_growth_rate = 0.02\n\n    prey += prey * prey_growth_rate\n    predator_consumption_rate = 0.05 * predators\n\n    if predators > 30:\n        predator_death_rate = 0.1\n    else:\n        predator_death_rate = 0.02\n\n    resources_consumed = predators * predator_consumption_rate\n    resources -= resources_consumed\n    predators -= predators * predator_death_rate\n    predators += 0.02 * prey\n    return predators, prey, resources\",\n\nIf the prey population decreases, does this imply that the resources have decreased without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in prey could be due to multiple factors in this model, including increased predator numbers or changes in their death rates. Resource levels influence prey growth rates but are not directly dependent on current prey population sizes; rather, they impact future prey growth rates. Therefore, a declining prey population does not necessarily imply that resources have decreased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The prey population influences the resources available, which in turn affects the predator population. The predator population can also consume resources and affect the prey population."
