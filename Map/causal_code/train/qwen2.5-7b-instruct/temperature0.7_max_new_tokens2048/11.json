  "Explanation": "Service order plays a critical role. If smaller orders are processed first, it might conserve inventory for later orders. Servicing smaller orders first can potentially leave enough inventory for the next order resulting in 'Order fulfilled'. Hence, changing the order sequence acts as an intervention that can modify the outcomes.",

Servicing smaller orders first ensures that the inventory amount remains higher for future orders, increasing the likelihood that response2 will be 'Order fulfilled'."
