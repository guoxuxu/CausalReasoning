  "Explanation": "The weather status 'Rainy and cold' comes only under the condition that 'isRaining' is true, which is set only when the 'updateWeather' method receives the 'rain' flag as true. Additionally, the 'Rainy and cold' status implies a temperature reduction potentially due to being less than 10 degrees initially.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Given that 'rain' parameter in 'updateWeather' is set to true, it directly causes 'isRaining' to be true, which in turn causes the weather status to report 'Rainy and cold' if the temperature is below 10 degrees."
