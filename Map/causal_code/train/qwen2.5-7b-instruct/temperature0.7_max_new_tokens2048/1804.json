  "Problem": "class TemperatureController:\n    def __init__(self, threshold):\n        self.threshold = threshold\n        self.temperature = 25  # Default temperature in Celsius\n        self.is_heating_on = False\n\n    def update_temperature(self, external_temp):\n        if external_temp < self.threshold:\n            self.is_heating_on = True\n            self.temperature += 2  # Simulate heating effect\n        else:\n            self.is_heating_on = False\n            self.temperature -= 1  # Simulate cooling effect\n\n    def reset(self):\n        self.temperature = 25\n        self.is_heating_on = False\",\n\nAfter the reset method is used, can observing no change in is_heating_on status be attributed to intervention preventing external temperatures from falling below the threshold?",
  "Explanation": "The reset method itself doesn’t manipulate external temperatures or their thresholds against which temperatures are checked. It only resets the internal states to their default values. No change in is_heating_on after reset does not necessarily mean external temperatures haven’t dropped below the threshold; it only indicates that update_temperature hasn’t yet been called or external conditions didn’t initiate heating.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The reset action directly sets the is_heating_on status to False and the temperature to 25. Observing no change in is_heating_on status after reset suggests that external temperatures have not fallen below the threshold since the last update_temperature call."
