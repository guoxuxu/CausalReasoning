  "Explanation": "If 'rain' is True, 'grass_wet' will be True regardless of the state of the 'sprinkler'. Thus, toggling the 'sprinkler' (through the function `toggle_sprinkler`) does not necessarily change the state of 'grass_wet', if rain is also causing the grass to be wet.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The state of sprinkler and rain directly cause grass_wet. Toggling sprinkler can change grass_wet if rain is not occurring, but if rain is occurring, sprinkler's state does not affect grass_wet."
