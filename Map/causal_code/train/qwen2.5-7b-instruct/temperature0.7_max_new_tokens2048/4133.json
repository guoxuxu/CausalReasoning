  "Explanation": "Low rainfall does not directly imply that temperatures were set lower through external intervention. The rainfall might be low either because it was directly reduced using decrease_rainfall or the temperature never reached the threshold to increase it.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the temperature can lead to an increase in rainfall, and reducing rainfall can lead to a decrease in temperature. Therefore, if observed rainfall is low, it could indicate that the temperature was intentionally decreased."
