  "Explanation": "When the WaterBoiler is turned off, the temperature is manually set to 20 degrees regardless of any prior use of the coolDown method. Therefore, a temperature read of 20 degrees with the power off does not indicate whether or not the coolDown method was used prior.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "isPowerOn directly controls the temperature and the boiling state of the water. When power is off and the temperature is 20, it suggests the power was turned off before heating could occur, but we cannot deduce that the coolDown method was specifically activated without more information."
