  "Explanation": "Increasing the temperature in the input data directly influences the adjusted_temperature. According to the code, adjusted_temp is calculated as 1.05 times the temperature if humidity is above 50; otherwise, it is equal to the temperature itself. Therefore, an increase in temperature directly results in an increase in adjusted_temperature, unless it is coupled with specific conditions of humidity that push the output to be calculated in the other conditional branch.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If temperature increases, adjusted_temperature may increase but depends on humidity. If humidity > 50, adjusted_temperature remains unchanged. Humidity influences whether the condition for comfortable temperature is met, but not directly on adjusted_temperature calculation."
