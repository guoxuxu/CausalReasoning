  "Problem": "class EventSimulator { int eventCount; double healthLevel; boolean isActive; EventSimulator() { eventCount = 0; healthLevel = 100.0; isActive = true; } void triggerEvent() { if (isActive) { eventCount++; healthLevel -= 10.0; } } void reset() { eventCount = 0; healthLevel = 100.0; isActive = true; } void deactivate() { isActive = false; } }\",\n\nIf eventCount increases, will healthLevel decrease without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, in the triggerEvent() method, each time an event is triggered (i.e., eventCount increases), the healthLevel decreases by 10.0, provided isActive is true. This decrease happens directly and solely due to the triggering of the event, without requiring any other intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
