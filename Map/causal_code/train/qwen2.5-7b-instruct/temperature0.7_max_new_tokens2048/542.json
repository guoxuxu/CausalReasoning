  "Explanation": "Bad weather is explicitly defined by the condition that the temperature is below 20 degrees and it is rainy. Therefore, if it's bad weather, it implies that both conditions are met, including the temperature being below 20.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
