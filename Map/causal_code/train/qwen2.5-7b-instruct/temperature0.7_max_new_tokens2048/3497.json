  "Problem": "class RoomController {\n  int temperature = 20;\n  boolean heaterOn = false;\n\n  public void increaseTemp() {\n    heaterOn = true;\n    temperature += 5;\n  }\n\n  public void decreaseTemp() {\n    if (heaterOn) {\n      heaterOn = false;\n    }\n    temperature -= 3;\n  }\n\n  public String checkStatus() {\n    if (heaterOn) {\n      return \"Heater is on and temperature is \" + temperature;\n    } else {\n      return \"Heater is off and temperature is \" + temperature;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nAssuming the temperature reads 25, does this guarantee that increaseTemp() was called if an external intervention could have increased the temperature?",
  "Explanation": "While increaseTemp() would result in a temperature of 25 by setting heaterOn to true and increasing the temperature from 20 to 25, the possibility of an external intervention such as direct manipulation of the temperature variable or an external heat source implies that observing a temperature of 25 doesn't necessarily confirm increaseTemp() was called. This addresses from effect to cause with intervention.",
