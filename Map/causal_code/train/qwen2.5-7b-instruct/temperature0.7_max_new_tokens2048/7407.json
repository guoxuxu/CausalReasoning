  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data):\n  if data['weekday'] in ['Saturday', 'Sunday']:\n    adjustment_factor = 1.1\n  else:\n    adjustment_factor = 0.9\n  base_sales = data['base_sales']\n  adjusted_sales = base_sales * adjustment_factor\n  if adjusted_sales > 1000:\n    discount = 0.05\n  else:\n    discount = 0.02\n  final_price = adjusted_sales * (1 - discount)\n  return final_price\",\n\nIf we intervene by increasing the `base_sales` by 10%, will the `final_price` always increase?",
  "Explanation": "By increasing `base_sales`, we directly increase `adjusted_sales` due to the multiplication by `adjustment_factor`. As `adjusted_sales` rises, even accounting for the possible increase in the `discount` (from meeting the threshold of sales greater than 1000), `final_price` will likely increase since the base multiplier has increased.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing base_sales by 10% will increase final_price because base_sales directly influences adjusted_sales and final_price, and adjusted_sales indirectly affects discount through its value."
