  "Explanation": "High productivity is determined by a happy mood, which in turn depends on sunny weather. Given the current code logic, sunny weather happens only if the temperature is above 20 degrees (is_sunny method), implying that a high productivity observation suggests that it indeed might have been triggered by high temperatures.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
