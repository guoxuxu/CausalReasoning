  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n    private int temperature;\n    private boolean isRaining;\n\n    public WeatherSimulator(int temperature) {\n        this.temperature = temperature;\n        this.isRaining = false;\n    }\n\n    public void updateWeather(int deltaTemp, boolean startRain) {\n        temperature += deltaTemp;\n        if (startRain && temperature < 20) {\n            isRaining = true;\n        } else {\n            isRaining = false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public boolean willItRain() {\n        return isRaining && temperature < 15;\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf it is observed that it is raining, can we infer that the temperature is currently below 15 degrees without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "While rain occurring does strongly suggest low temperature, it being below 15 degrees is only a possibility, not a certainty, as rain can start as long as the temperature is below 20 degrees. Hence, we cannot infer with certainty that the temperature must be below 15 degrees just from the rain.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If it is raining, it does not necessarily mean the temperature is currently below 15 degrees. The temperature must be below 20 and below 15 for it to rain according to the simulator's rules."
