  "Explanation": "According to the `checkGrowthConditions()` method, plant growth occurs only when both conditions are met: the temperature is above 20 and the light is on. Therefore, observing plant growth implies that both conditions were true, including the temperature being above 20.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
