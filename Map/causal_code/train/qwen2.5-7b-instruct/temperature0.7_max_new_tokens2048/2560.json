  "Explanation": "Rain can be caused in the code through method `causeStorm` only if temperature is above 32 degrees, but there is no code segment that restricts rain to exclusively occur when temperature is above 32. Rain can be initially true when the simulator is created with it being true, irrespective of the temperature.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The occurrence of rain does not necessarily imply that the temperature is above 32 degrees. Rain can occur when the temperature is below 0 degrees if the temperature drops to below 0 after it starts raining, and it can also occur when the temperature is above 32 degrees if the temperature is already above 32 before the rain starts."
