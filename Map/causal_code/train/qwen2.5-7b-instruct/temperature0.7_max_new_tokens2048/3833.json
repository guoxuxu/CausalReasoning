  "Explanation": "Modifying the 'calculate_revenue' function to ignore user status does not influence the actual status of the promotion. It merely affects how revenue is calculated without impacting the promotion's active or inactive status.",

The implementation of calculate_revenue does not directly depend on promo_status once it has set user['status']. Changing calculate_revenue to ignore user status does not imply the promotion is no longer active."
