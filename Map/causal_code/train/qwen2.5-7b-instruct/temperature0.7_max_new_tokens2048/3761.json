  "Explanation": "Manually setting the 'category' to 'High' does not provide any information about the actual calculation or value of 'revenue'. The category could have been set to 'High' through an error or intervention, and not necessarily because 'revenue' was greater than 1000 as required by the code logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of 'price' and 'quantity' in data directly causes revenue to be calculated as their product. Revenue directly causes data['category'] to be set as 'High' if it exceeds 1000; otherwise, it is set as 'Low'. Manually setting data['category'] to 'High' does not necessarily indicate that revenue is greater than 1000, as revenue can only affect category through the condition revenue > 1000."
