  "Problem": "def analyze_data(data, filter_threshold): \n    filtered_data = [d for d in data if d['value'] > filter_threshold] \n    average = sum(item['value'] for item in filtered_data) / len(filtered_data) \n    print('Filtered average:', average) \n    return { 'average': average, 'count': len(filtered_data) }\",\n\nIf an intervention sets all data values to exceed any chosen filter_threshold, will the average be the overall original average?",
  "Explanation": "If an intervention modifies all data values to exceed whatever filter_threshold is chosen, then essentially no data is filtered out. This means the average calculated will include all items in the original dataset, reflecting the overall original average.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When all data values exceed the filter_threshold, the filtered_data becomes the entire original data, thus the average of filtered_data is the same as the overall original average."
