  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * demand * tax_rate \n    discounted_price = price - price * discount \n    total_revenue = discounted_price * demand + tax_amount \n    return total_revenue\",\n\nIf it is observed that 'total_revenue' decreased after increasing 'tax_rate', can we conclude that the 'demand' went unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Observing a decrease in 'total_revenue' following an increase in 'tax_rate' does not necessarily imply that 'demand' remained unchanged. The interplay between tax impact and consumer behavior could mean that the increase in taxation led to a decrease in demand due to higher final consumer prices. Without explicit evidence showing demand held constant, this conclusion would be speculative.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
