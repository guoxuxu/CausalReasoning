  "Explanation": "The growth rate will not increase merely by increasing sunlight above 50 if the water level is not above 20, as both conditions need to be satisfied simultaneously to affect the growth rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
