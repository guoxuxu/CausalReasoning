  "Explanation": "With humidity set to zero, w becomes 0, meaning the result solely depends on z, which is directly calculated from the temperature with a consistent factor (either 0.9 or 1.1). A very low result implies that z (and hence the temperature) must also be low because there is no other contributing factor to the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature is 30 or below, then z equals x times 1.1; if the temperature is above 30, then z equals x times 0.9; humidity determines w, which, along with z, influences the result. Given that humidity is zero and the result is very low, it suggests the temperature was likely high."
