  "Explanation": "Modifying 'remove_noise' changes what data gets considered as noise. By adjusting the threshold from 0 to -5, it potentially allows more data points to be included, which could change the average calculated in 'analyze'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the new threshold (-5) is applied in 'remove_noise', it will filter out data less than or equal to -5, resulting in different 'filtered_data'. This change will then lead to potentially different 'analyzed_data', which in turn will affect the 'process_data_output'."
