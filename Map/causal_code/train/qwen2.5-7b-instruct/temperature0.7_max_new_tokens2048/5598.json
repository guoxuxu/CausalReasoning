  "Explanation": "The occurrence of 'Special case: Critical low on electronics' implies electronics are less than 20, which might be due to natural sales processes or pre-existing low stock rather than human intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
