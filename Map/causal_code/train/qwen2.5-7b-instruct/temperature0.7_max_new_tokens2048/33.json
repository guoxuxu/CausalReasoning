  "Explanation": "The increase in temperature influences visitors_satisfaction indirectly through its effect on comfort. However, satisfaction is also dependent on whether it is sunny or not (mood), and past a certain threshold (20 degrees), just increasing temperature will not affect comfort (already 'comfortable'). Thus, without knowing the condition 'is_sunny', one cannot guarantee that visitors_satisfaction will increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
