  "Explanation": "The addPromotion method directly increases demand by 20 units, then reduces it slightly depending on supply (10% of supply). Overall, since the increase is a flat amount initially, demand increases, showing a positive effect even if supply increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "When the addPromotion method is called, it increases demand by 20 and then decreases demand by 0.1 times supply. Despite an increase in supply, the net effect on demand depends on the specific values of supply and the promotion's impact."
