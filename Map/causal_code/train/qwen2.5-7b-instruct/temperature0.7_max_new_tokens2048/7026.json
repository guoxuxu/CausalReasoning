  "Explanation": "From cause (threshold) to effect (category), changing the threshold from 50 to 40 affects whether the value 60 exceeds the threshold or not, which in turn determines if the category is 'High' or 'Low'. Here, since 60 would still exceed 40, the category remains 'High'. However, the change in threshold definitely affects the decision path.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
