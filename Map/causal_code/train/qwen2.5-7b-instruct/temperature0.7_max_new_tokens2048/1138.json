  "Explanation": "Increasing 'beta' raises the amount of 'fertilizer', which directly influences 'yield_output'. Since 'yield_output' is calculated as a sum of contributions from both rainfall (controlled by 'alpha') and fertilizer (controlled by 'beta'), increasing 'beta' will increase the yield output, illustrating a causal effect with intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing beta increases the result, and increasing alpha increases rainfall which in turn increases the yield output. The result is a combination of the effects of rainfall and fertilizer."
