  "Explanation": "When the mode is 'normalize', the data undergoes a transformation where each element is divided by the maximum value of the dataset, effectively scaling all the data points between 0 and 1. Therefore, the data is always transformed.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
