  "Problem": "def compute_discount(price, is_member, discount_rate):\n    if is_member:\n        discount = price * discount_rate\n    else:\n        discount = 0\n    final_price = price - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final discounted price is higher than expected, does it imply that the `is_member` variable was set to False?",
  "Explanation": "A higher than expected final price might also occur due to a low `discount_rate` even if `is_member` is True. Therefore, a higher final price alone does not imply that `is_member` was set to False, as multiple factors influence the `final_price`.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If is_member is True, then a discount is applied which reduces the final_price. If is_member is False, no discount is applied and the final_price remains at the original price."
