  "Explanation": "Increasing the temperature directly increases the 'adjusted_temp', which generally makes 'comfort_index' higher considering other conditions constant. However, a higher 'comfort_index' alone doesn't ensure comfort unless the humidity is below 80%, according to the code. Thus, without knowing the specific relationship or changes in humidity alongside, we cannot confirm that increasing temperature alone makes 'is_comfortable' more likely.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in temperature directly increases both adjusted_temp and comfort_index, while an increase in humidity directly decreases adjusted_temp and decreases comfort_index. Adjusted_temp and comfort_index are directly related, and comfort_index's value above 65 and below 80 humidity determines the is_comfortable flag."
