  "Explanation": "Decrease in growth rate could be due to a reduction in water, sunlight, or fertilizer. Without additional information, it cannot be conclusively said that the decrease was due to reduced sunlight alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
