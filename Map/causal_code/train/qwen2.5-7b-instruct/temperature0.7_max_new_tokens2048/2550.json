  "Explanation": "When 'process_data' yields a significantly higher mean age, it suggests that the dataset has been modified to either remove younger individuals or predominantly include older individuals. Given that the 'clean_data' function's role includes removing individuals under 18, its intervention directly leads to such a demographic shift in the dataset, assuming no other variables have been altered.",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The application of the lambda function in `clean_data` filters out ages less than 18, followed by dropping rows with NaN values in 'age', ensuring that `analyzed_data` contains only ages 18 and above. Consequently, if `process_data` outputs a significantly older mean age, it suggests the input dataset has been modified to exclude individuals under 18."
