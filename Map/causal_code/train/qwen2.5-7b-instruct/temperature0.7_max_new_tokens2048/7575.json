  "Explanation": "Setting 'score_weight' to 1 and nullifying 'age_weight' effectively makes the 'final_score' solely dependent on the 'test_score'. This intervention isolates 'test_score' as the single contributor to the 'final_score', with 'age_score' being eliminated from the equation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
