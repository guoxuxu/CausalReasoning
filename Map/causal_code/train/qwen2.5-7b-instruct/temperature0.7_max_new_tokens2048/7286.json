  "Explanation": "The update_inventory() function is called within update_sales_record() to decrease inventory by the sale amount. However, the inventory won't decrease if there is an error in the code or if the inventory is already zero, which prevents negative inventory. Zero inventory does not necessarily mean there were no sales.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Updating the sales record causes updates to the inventory, and the sale amount directly decreases the inventory level."
