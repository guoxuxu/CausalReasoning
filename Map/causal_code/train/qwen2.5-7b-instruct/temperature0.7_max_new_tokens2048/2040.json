  "Explanation": "A significant decrease in 'mean' could result from changes in 'analyze_data', 'clean_data', or even the original dataset filter criteria, not necessarily modifications directly in 'analyze_data'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
