  "Explanation": "In the given code, a promotion during Winter causes a different sales increase (10 unit increase) compared to a Summer promotion (15 unit increase). This is a direct result of the differing effects of promotions in different seasons as coded.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
