  "Explanation": "The alarm is triggered only when the sensor is active and more than five movements are detected. If the sensor remains inactive, no movements would be recorded to contribute towards triggering the alarm.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
