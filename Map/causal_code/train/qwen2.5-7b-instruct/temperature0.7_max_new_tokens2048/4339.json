  "Problem": "{\n    \"code\": \"def signal_strength(users, obstacles):\n    base_strength = 100\n    for obstacle in obstacles:\n        if obstacle == 'tree':\n            base_strength -= 10\n        elif obstacle == 'building':\n            base_strength -= 30\n    user_strengths = {}\n    for user in users:\n        if user['distance'] < 50:\n            user_strengths[user['name']] = base_strength - 5 * (user['distance'] / 10)\n        else:\n            user_strengths[user['name']] = base_strength - 15 * (user['distance'] / 50)\n    return user_strengths\"\n  },\n\nIf trees were removed from the obstacles list, would the signal strength increase for all users?",
  "Explanation": "Based on the code, the presence of trees as obstacles deducts 10 units from the base_strength. Removing trees (an intervention) from the obstacles list prevents this deduction, leading to a higher base strength and consequently higher signal strength across all users unless affected by other factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The removal of trees from the obstacles list would increase the signal strength for users whose distance is less than 50 units, as the base strength increases by 10 when trees are absent."
