  "Problem": "def calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, bonus_percentage):\n    taxes = gross_salary * tax_rate\n    bonus = gross_salary * bonus_percentage\n    net_salary = gross_salary - taxes + bonus\n    return net_salary\",\n\nIf the gross salary increases, will the net salary definitely increase, assuming tax rate and bonus percentage remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in gross salary leads directly to an increase in net salary when the tax rate and bonus percentage are constant. The formula gross_salary * tax_rate for taxes and gross_salary * bonus_percentage for bonus both scale linearly with the gross salary, so their combined effect on the net salary calculation will also increase net salary proportionally.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
