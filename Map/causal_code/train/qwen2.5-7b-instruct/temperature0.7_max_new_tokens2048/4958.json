  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, stock, discount_factor):\n    if discount_factor > 0.5:\n        discount = price * 0.10\n    else:\n        discount = price * discount_factor\n    final_price = price - discount\n    total_sales = final_price * stock\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf total_sales have increased significantly, was this because of fixing the discount to 10% and increasing the price?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in total_sales cannot be solely attributed to fixing the discount at 10% and increasing the price. Factors like stock levels play a critical role, as the same discount and price increase on different stock levels would lead to different total_sales figures.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the discount factor is greater than 0.5, the discount is set to 10% of the price, which reduces the final price. The final price and stock determine the total sales."
