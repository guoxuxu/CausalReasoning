  "Explanation": "Manual adjustment of the temperature bypasses the seasonal checks in adjustTemperatureBasedOnSeason, and since there are no conditional ties specified between temperature and humidity in adjustHumidityBasedOnWeather method, humidity remains dependent only on weather not on the manually set temperature or season.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
