  "Explanation": "Although the system's default behavior is to match the external temperature, there are interventions like turning on the heater that can increase the temperature independently of external temperature changes. Therefore, a rise in the system's temperature does not necessarily imply an increase in external temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The system's temperature is influenced by the external temperature, the air conditioning being on, and the heater being on. An increase in the external temperature or the activation of the heater can cause the system's temperature to increase, but it cannot be assumed solely based on the observed increase in the system's temperature that the external temperature has increased."
