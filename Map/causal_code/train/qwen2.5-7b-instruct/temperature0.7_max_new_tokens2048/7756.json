  "Explanation": "After resetting, dailySteps and reachedGoal are both reset to 0 and false, respectively. Updating again with 10500 steps will cause the condition in updateSteps to evaluate to true, hence setting reachedGoal to true again.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "dailySteps being at least 10000 directly causes reachedGoal to be true; otherwise, it is false. Resetting dailySteps to 0 and setting reachedGoal to false ensures that unless dailySteps increases to at least 10000 again, reachedGoal will remain false."
