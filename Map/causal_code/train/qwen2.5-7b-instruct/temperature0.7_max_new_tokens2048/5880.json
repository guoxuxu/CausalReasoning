  "Problem": "def calculate_performance(sales, costs, marketing_expense): \n\\tprofit = sales - costs\n\\tROI = (profit / marketing_expense) * 100\n\\treturn ROI\",\n\nIf 'ROI' is observed to decrease, can it be deduced that 'sales' have decreased without additional information?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'ROI' could result from a decrease in 'sales', an increase in 'costs', an increase in 'marketing_expense', or a combination of these. Without specific information about 'costs' and 'marketing_expense', a conclusion about 'sales' cannot be confidently made.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Decrease in sales or increase in costs can lead to a decrease in profit, which may result in a decrease in ROI. Directly, an increase in marketing expense will decrease ROI."
