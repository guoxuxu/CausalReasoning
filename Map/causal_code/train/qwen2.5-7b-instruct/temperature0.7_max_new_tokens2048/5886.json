  "Problem": "{\n    \"PythonCode\": [\n      \"def calculate_costs(quantity, base_cost, transport_cost):\",\n      \"    total_cost = (quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost\",\n      \"    if quantity > 50:\",\n      \"        discount = 0.1 # 10% discount\",\n      \"        total_cost = total_cost - (total_cost * discount)\",\n      \"    return total_cost\"\n    ]\n  },\n\nIf 'total_cost' increases, can we conclude that there was no external influence reducing 'base_cost' or 'transport_cost'?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in 'total_cost' can still occur despite reductions in 'base_cost' or 'transport_cost' if the 'quantity' increases substantially, especially if the quantity does not exceed the discount threshold or the price reduction is not sufficient to outweigh the cost added by extra units.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If 'total_cost' increases, it suggests that either 'base_cost' or 'transport_cost' increased, or the quantity was 50 or less, preventing the application of the discount."
