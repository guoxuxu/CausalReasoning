  "Explanation": "Though an increase in heat index can lead to a mood of 'Irritated' if the person isn't 'Sunny', it is not strictly true in reverse. A 'Sunny' person would be 'Happy' even above a heat index of 80. Also, other smaller heat indexes could still cause irritation due to other unidentified factors not covered in the code or a person other than 'Sunny'.",
