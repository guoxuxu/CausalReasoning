  "Explanation": "With intervention, assuming the state of the lights is adjusted manually, observing the red light being definitively on still suggests a 'RESET' command was executed, assuming no external interventions on the state variable itself. This reset typically sets the red light to true uniformly.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The state of the traffic light controller directly determines which lights are on. Specifically, when the state is 'RED', the red light is on; when the state changes to 'GREEN', the green light is on and the red light is off; when the state changes to 'YELLOW', the yellow light is on and the green light is off. Conversely, turning on the red light implies the state is 'RED', turning on the green light implies the state was previously 'RED' and then 'GREEN', and turning on the yellow light implies the state was previously 'GREEN'. A 'RESET' command sets the state to 'RED' and turns on the red light, but observing the red light does not exclusively imply a 'RESET' command was executed, as the state could also have been changed through other commands like 'NEXT' from 'GREEN' to 'RED'. Therefore, while the red light being on can indicate a 'RESET' command, it is not definitive without additional context."
