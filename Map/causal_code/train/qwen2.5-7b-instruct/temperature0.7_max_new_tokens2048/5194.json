  "Explanation": "If the 'add_item' method does not correctly update the prices (either by not updating at all or by setting incorrect prices), leading to higher price values for items, this would cause a higher than expected calculated total. Incorrect price handling upon item addition impacts the cumulative cost calculation.",
