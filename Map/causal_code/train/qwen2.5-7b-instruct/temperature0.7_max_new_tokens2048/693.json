  "Explanation": "In this particular setup, a salary increase is conditional on John's performance rating being above 80, and it increases by a specific rate (10%) only when this condition is met. Therefore, an increase in salary is a direct indicator that John's performance rating was high enough to trigger this adjustment.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A direct increase in John's salary does not necessarily indicate a change in his performance rating without additional interventions, as performance ratings are adjusted based on their current values and only updated during the reviewPerformance function."
