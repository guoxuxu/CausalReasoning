  "Explanation": "With x controlled at a constant value, an increase in t2 could result not only from an increase in y but also from already having t1 > 50, such that the conditional logic in the if block triggers adding more to t2 regardless of changes in y.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Controlling x constant, an increase in t2 may indicate an increase in y, but it is not necessarily due to y alone as t1's value (determined by both x and y) also directly influences t2."
