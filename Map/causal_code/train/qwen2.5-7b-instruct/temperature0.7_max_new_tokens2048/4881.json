  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'error' in data:\n        data = correct_errors(data)\n    cleaned_data = clean_data(data)\n    processed_data = analyze_data(cleaned_data)\n    return processed_data\n\ndef correct_errors(data):\n    return data.replace('error', 'corrected')\n\ndef clean_data(data):\n    return data.strip()\n\ndef analyze_data(data):\n    if len(data) > 50:\n        return 'Data is too large'\n    else:\n        return 'Data processed successfully'\",\n\nIf an additional step is added to 'clean_data' to reduce data length, will it prevent the 'Data is too large' outcome from 'analyze_data'?",
  "Explanation": "By adding steps to reduce the length of the data in 'clean_data', less data is passed to 'analyze_data'. Consequently, this reduces the likelihood of exceeding the length threshold that triggers the 'Data is too large' outcome. This is an example of inferring from cause to effect with an intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
