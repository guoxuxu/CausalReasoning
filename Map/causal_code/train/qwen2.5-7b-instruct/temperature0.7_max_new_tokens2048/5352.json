  "Explanation": "Higher input values, when multiplied by any positive set of weights, will lead to higher weighted sums, thus resulting in higher scores. Therefore, observing higher scores directly suggests that the input values are higher in the dataset.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
