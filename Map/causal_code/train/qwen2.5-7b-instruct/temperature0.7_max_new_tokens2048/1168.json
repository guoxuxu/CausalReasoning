  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    modified_data = data * 2 \n    final_data = modified_data + 100 \n    return final_data\n\nresult = process_data(50)\",\n\nIf the function 'process_data' is called with a value of 50, will the 'final_data' always end up being 200?",
  "Explanation": "The final_data result is calculated by first doubling the input (50 * 2 = 100) and then adding 100, which leads to a final_data result of 200. The assumed value seems correct only for this particular input, but the question implies a general rule which is false as other inputs produce different results.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
