  "Problem": "def compute_health_scores(age, diet_quality, exercise_freq): \n    risk_factor = age / 2 + diet_quality * 0.5 - exercise_freq \n    if risk_factor > 20: \n        health_score = 100 - risk_factor \n    else: \n        health_score = 80 + (20 - risk_factor / 2) \n    return health_score\",\n\nGiven an increase in 'health_score', is it correct to adjust 'exercise_freq' to improve it further?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in 'health_score' suggests a lowering in 'risk_factor'. To facilitate further increase in 'health_score', increasing 'exercise_freq' would be beneficial as it subtracts directly from 'risk_factor' (- exercise_freq). This demonstrates a potential intervention based on the observed effect on 'health_score' to hypothesize the causality effect of increasing 'exercise_freq'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing exercise frequency decreases risk factor, which increases health score. Therefore, adjusting exercise frequency can help improve health score."
