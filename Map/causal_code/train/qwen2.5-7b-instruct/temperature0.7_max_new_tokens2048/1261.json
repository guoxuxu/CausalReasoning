  "Problem": "def process_order(order_status, promo_applied, user_category):\n    if order_status == 'pending' and promo_applied:\n        discount = 0.15 if user_category == 'premium' else 0.05\n    elif order_status == 'pending' and not promo_applied:\n        discount = 0 if user_category == 'premium' else 0.03\n    else:\n        discount = 0\n    total_savings = calculate_savings(discount)\n    return total_savings\n\ndef calculate_savings(discount):\n    base_cost = 100\n    savings = base_cost * discount\n    return savings\",\n\nIf total_savings are greater than zero, can it be concluded that the order was 'pending'?",
  "Explanation": "A non-zero total_savings suggests that a discount was applied, but this can occur with any order_status provided that the appropriate conditions in 'promo_applied' and 'user_category' are fulfilled. Therefore, we cannot infer the order_status directly from the savings amount without additional information.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_map": "order_status → discount; promo_applied → discount; user_category → discount; discount → total_savings; base_cost → total_savings; total_savings → order was pending",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "order_status and promo_applied and user_category jointly determine discount, which then determines total_savings; base_cost is a constant factor in calculating total_savings; order was pending if total_savings are greater than zero"
