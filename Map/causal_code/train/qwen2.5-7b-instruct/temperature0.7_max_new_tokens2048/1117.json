  "Problem": "def calculate_health_effects(smoking, exercise_hours, diet_quality):\n    lung_health = 100 - (20 * smoking) + (10 * exercise_hours)\n    obesity_risk = diet_quality * 30 - exercise_hours * 10\n    cancer_risk = 50 + (25 * smoking) - (5 * diet_quality)\n    return lung_health, obesity_risk, cancer_risk\",\n\nIf we observe a person with low cancer risk, can we infer that they do not smoke?",
  "Explanation": "Low cancer risk could result from high diet quality offsetting the impact of smoking or other factors not accounted for in the code. Therefore, observing low cancer risk does not solely allow us to infer a person's smoking status.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
