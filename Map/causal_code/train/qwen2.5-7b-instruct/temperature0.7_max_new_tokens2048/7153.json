  "Problem": "def compute(a, b): \n    x = a * 2 \n    y = b + 5 \n    z = x + y \n    w = z - 3 \n    return w\",\n\nIf the input value of 'a' is increased, will the final value returned by 'compute' function increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'a' causes 'x' to increase (since x = a * 2). This in turn increases 'z' (since z = x + y), and because 'w' is directly dependent on 'z' (w = z - 3), 'w' will also increase. The function's output directly increases with an increase in 'a'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
