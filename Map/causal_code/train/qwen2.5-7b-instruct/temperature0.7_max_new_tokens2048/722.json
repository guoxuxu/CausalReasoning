  "Explanation": "By manually setting numbers to be even, we ensure the condition for multiplying them by 10 is fulfilled. Therefore, processing this modified input will result in each number being multiplied by 10.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
