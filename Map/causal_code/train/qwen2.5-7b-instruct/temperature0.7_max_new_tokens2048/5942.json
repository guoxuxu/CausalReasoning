  "Explanation": "While the increase in health_score indeed must come from changes in its components, without a change in environmental_quality, the remaining factors are healthcare_funding and public_awareness. A rise in healthcare_funding alone could also account for the increase in health_score; therefore, an increase in public_awareness cannot be definitively concluded without further evidence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
