  "Explanation": "By manually mutating ten individuals before running 'mutate_population', they remain mutated, and the function might mutate additional individuals based on the mutation rate. Therefore, the total number of mutated individuals can be more than ten.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
