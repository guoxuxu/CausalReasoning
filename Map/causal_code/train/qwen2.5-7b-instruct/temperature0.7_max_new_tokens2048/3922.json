  "Explanation": "The threshold is calculated as the mean plus twice the standard deviation (mean_val + 2 * std_dev). If the mean or standard deviation increases, the threshold will naturally increase, leading to possibly fewer data points being classified as outliers.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
