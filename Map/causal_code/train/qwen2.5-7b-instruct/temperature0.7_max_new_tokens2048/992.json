  "Problem": "def update_score(score, bonus, penalty): \n    new_score = score + bonus - penalty \n    return new_score \n\ninitial_score = 100 \nadditional_bonus = 20 \nextra_penalty = 5 \n\nfinal_score = update_score(initial_score, additional_bonus, extra_penalty)\",\n\nIf no bonus is provided, will the score only decrease because of the penalty?",
  "Explanation": "Since the update function calculates the new score by adding the bonus to the initial score and subtracting the penalty, if there is no bonus (bonus = 0), the new score solely decreases by the penalty amount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
