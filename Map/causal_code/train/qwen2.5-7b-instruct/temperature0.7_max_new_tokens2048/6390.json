  "Explanation": "Although drinking more water decreases calorie intake by 5 calories, calorie intake could also decrease by sleeping more than 7 hours or naturally fluctuate due to other unobserved factors. Thus, a decrease in calorie intake does not definitively suggest that water intake was increased through intervention.",
