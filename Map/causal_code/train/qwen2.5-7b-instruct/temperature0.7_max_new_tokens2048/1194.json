  "Problem": "def compute_salary(base_salary, performance_rating, years_of_experience): \n\\tbonus_percentage = 0.05 * performance_rating \n\\tbonus = base_salary * bonus_percentage \n\\tif years_of_experience > 5: \n\\t\\tbonus += 1000 \n\\treturn base_salary + bonus\",\n\nIf the years of experience are manually set to exceed 5 years, will this guarantee an increase in the total salary computed by holding all other factors constant?",
  "Explanation": "When years of experience exceeds 5, an additional $1000 is added to the bonus, irrespective of the base salary or performance rating. Since the bonus is a component of the total salary calculation, this intervention directly increases the total salary.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
