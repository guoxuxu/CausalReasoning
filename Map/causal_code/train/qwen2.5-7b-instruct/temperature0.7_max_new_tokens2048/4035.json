  "Problem": "def compute_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, season):\n    if season == 'winter':\n        discount_rate += 0.05\n    elif season == 'summer':\n        discount_rate -= 0.03\n    final_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate)\n    tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate\n    total_price = final_price + tax_amount\n    return total_price\",\n\nIf the total_price observed is higher than usual, can it be inferred that the base_price was higher?",
  "Explanation": "While a higher base_price can lead to a higher total_price, other factors such as a lower discount_rate or higher tax_rate could also result in a higher total_price. Therefore, one cannot conclusively infer the increase in base_price just from an increase in total_price without considering these factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The base price directly influences the final price, which in turn directly influences the total price."
