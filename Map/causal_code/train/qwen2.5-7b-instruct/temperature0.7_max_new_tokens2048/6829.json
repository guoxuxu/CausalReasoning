  "Problem": "def adjust_temperature(sensor, desired_temp):\n    current_temp = get_reading(sensor)\n    heater_on = False\n    if current_temp < desired_temp - 5:\n        heater_on = True\n        increase_temperature(desired_temp - current_temp)\n    elif current_temp > desired_temp + 5:\n        decrease_temperature(current_temp - desired_temp)\n    return heater_on\",\n\nIf the desired temperature is achieved, can we conclude that either 'increase_temperature' or 'decrease_temperature' was called?",
  "Explanation": "Reaching the desired temperature when there is a significant initial difference in temperature as per the coded logic implies that internal functions to adjust temperature, i.e., 'increase_temperature' or 'decrease_temperature', would have been involved. This manipulation likely intervened to correct the temperature discrepancy.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If the current temperature (current_temp) is below the desired temperature minus five degrees, then the increase_temperature function is called. If the current temperature is above the desired temperature plus five degrees, then the decrease_temperature function is called. The desired temperature influences the current temperature reading, which in turn determines whether the increase_temperature or decrease_temperature function is invoked."
