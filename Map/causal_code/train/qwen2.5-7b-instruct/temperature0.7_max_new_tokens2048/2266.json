  "Explanation": "If 'final_score' remains unchanged after setting 'bonus_points' to zero, it indicates that either 'has_bonus' was initially False, or 'bonus_points' initially had no effect (possibly being zero already or overridden by having no bonus). Therefore, we cannot conclusively say 'has_bonus' was initially True.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
