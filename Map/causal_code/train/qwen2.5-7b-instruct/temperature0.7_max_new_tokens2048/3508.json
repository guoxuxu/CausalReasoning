  "Explanation": "With humidity set to zero, the variable w in the formula would be zero. Therefore, any contribution to the result solely depends on z, which is directly proportional to temperature (either 0.9 or 1.1 times depending on whether temperature is above or below 30). Therefore, an increase in temperature directly increases z, and thus the result.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in temperature (when above 30) leads to a decrease in z, which then influences the result. An increase in humidity leads to an increase in w, also influencing the result. Setting humidity to zero removes its effect on the result, so only temperature's effect through z matters. Therefore, an increase in temperature, when humidity is zero, may or may not increase the result depending on the specific values."
