  "Explanation": "Since `processed_data` is derived by filtering `data` based on certain conditions (age above 30 and income over 50000), any changes in `data` will potentially change `processed_data`. This is a direct causal relationship where changes in the cause (`data`) would impact the effect (`processed_data`).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A list's content (data) directly causes changes in filtered_data and processed_data. The age and income fields of items in data directly cause their inclusion in filtered_data. The education field of items in filtered_data directly causes the status field to be set to 'Approved' or 'Pending Review'."
