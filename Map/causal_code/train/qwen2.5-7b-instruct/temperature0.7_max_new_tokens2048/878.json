  "Explanation": "For a user logged in as 'admin' with the correct password, the user_type is set to 'admin', and 'perform_action' for 'admin' is exclusively 'delete database'. 'View data' is only available to user_type 'user'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the username is 'admin' and the password is 'root', the user_type will be 'admin', which leads to performing the action 'delete database'. For other cases, including when the username is 'user' and the password is '1234', the user_type will be 'user', leading to the action 'view data'. Therefore, if an admin uses the correct password 'root', 'view data' will not be the performed action."
