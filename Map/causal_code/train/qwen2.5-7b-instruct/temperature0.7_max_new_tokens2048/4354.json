  "Explanation": "Rain can be triggered by either external factors or if the temperature is below 5 (not necessarily below zero) during the check in the 'checkRain' method, or if the temperature was reduced during the 'simulateDay' method when it was raining. Hence, simply seeing rain does not assure that the temperature was ever adjusted below zero.",
