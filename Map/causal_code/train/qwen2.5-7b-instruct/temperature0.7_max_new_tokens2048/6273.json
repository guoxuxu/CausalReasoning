  "Explanation": "From cause to effect with intervention: Setting x to 20 results in y = 2*20 + noise, where noise is a random number from a normal distribution. Hence y has variability. Since z = 3y + 5, and y contains random component, z will not be constantly 125, but will vary around an expected value due to noise in y.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
