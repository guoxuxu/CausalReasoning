  "Explanation": "Given these conditions and outcomes, and knowing no other interventions or external factors are at play (from the provided code), the specific increase by 10 can only be attributed to the scenario where region is 'East' and season is 'Summer' as per the logic defined in the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
