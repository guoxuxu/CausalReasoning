  "Explanation": "An increase in the total_salary could result either from an increase in the base_salary or from the application of a bonus (if previously not applied) or an increment in the bonus rate. Therefore, increasing total_salary does not solely depend on the base_salary.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Base salary, bonus rate, and whether a bonus is applied each directly influence the total salary. The total salary is increased if the base salary increases, if the bonus rate increases, or if a bonus is applied."
