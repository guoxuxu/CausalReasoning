  "Explanation": "A lower 'final_amount' than 'purchase_amount' denotes a discount was applied, which happens if 'is_adult' is True. However, this does not imply an intervention since 'is_adult' can be set based on the 'age' being greater than or equal to 18, which is a normal data-driven setting rather than an external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Age determines whether the individual is considered an adult, which in turn affects the discount applied. The presence of a purchase amount influences the final amount after applying the discount."
