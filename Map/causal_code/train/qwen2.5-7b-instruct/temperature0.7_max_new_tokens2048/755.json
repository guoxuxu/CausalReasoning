  "Explanation": "Since an increase in marketing_spend would naturally tend to increase sales due to its impact on marketing_effectiveness, a decrease in final_sales despite increased marketing spend implies that a stronger opposing force, such as a decrease in demand (or potentially price), is affecting sales negatively.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Price and demand directly affect final sales. Marketing spend increases marketing effectiveness, which in turn increases adjusted sales. Therefore, a decrease in final_sales while marketing_spend increases suggests a possible decrease in either price or demand."
