  "Explanation": "Increasing weight leads to a higher BMI when the height is constant. According to the function 'health_risk', higher BMI values fall into more severe health risk categories such as overweight or obese.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
