  "Explanation": "The output of `process_data()` depends on multiple steps including noise removal and normalization before data gets analyzed. Therefore, a high value in `process_data()` doesn't necessarily imply that `analyze_data()` is biased; instead, it could be the result of how the data was processed in earlier steps.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The `remove_noise` and `normalize` functions process the input data to produce `clean_data` and `normalized_data`, which are then analyzed by the `analyze_data` function to generate the `result`. A high value in the `result` does not necessarily indicate bias in the `analyze_data` function, as it depends on the outputs of `remove_noise` and `normalize`."
