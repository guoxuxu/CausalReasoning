  "Explanation": "A rise in novel sales does not necessarily imply that promotions were applied. Sales can be affected by multiple factors like promotions, seasonality, or marketing efforts outside the scope of current discount settings. Observing a direct cause (promotion) from an effect (sales rise) without additional data on promotions impact at the time is logically inconclusive.",
