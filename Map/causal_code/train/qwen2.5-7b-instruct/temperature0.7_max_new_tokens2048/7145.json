  "Explanation": "Based on the code, if the temperature is above 100, 'temp_status' is set to 'high'. If both 'temp_status' is 'high' and 'humidity' is above 50, then 'risk' is set to 'high'. Therefore, a high temperature can potentially lead to a high risk status, contingent on the level of humidity.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
