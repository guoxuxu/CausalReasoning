  "Explanation": "The increase to 101 in the heart rate and the subsequent alert about 'high_heart_rate' is confined within the local functionalities of the `Update_heart_rate()` method and `alert()` function. External actions like alerting a paramedic are not implicated within these methods and can't be inferred from this change.",
