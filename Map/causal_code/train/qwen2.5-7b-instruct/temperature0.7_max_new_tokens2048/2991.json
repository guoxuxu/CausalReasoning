  "Explanation": "If forecasted_sales is below 150, it implies that base_sales were set to the lower level of 100 which only happens if temperature is below 75. Regardless of the discount rate applied, the sales would not reach or exceed 150 unless the base_rate started at 200, which is controlled by a higher temperature threshold.",
