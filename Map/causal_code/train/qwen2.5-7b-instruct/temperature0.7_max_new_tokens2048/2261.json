  "Explanation": "By setting (or intervening) the values of humidity and temperature specifically to meet the conditional requirements outlined for 'Tropical' status, the code will subsequently alter the weather_status to 'Tropical'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
