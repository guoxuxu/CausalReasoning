  "Explanation": "Without any interventions, just observing that if temperature increases significantly while humidity remains above 70%, the weather could change its status to 'Tropical' according to the code’s conditional structure.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
