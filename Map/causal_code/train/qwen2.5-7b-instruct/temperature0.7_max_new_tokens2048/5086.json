  "Explanation": "A reduced total could occur due to either discounts being applied or items being removed from the cart, among other possible interventions. This question looks to test if an effect (reduced total) can conclusively indicate a specific cause (discounts), which in this case, it cannot without additional detail about other activities affecting the total.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
