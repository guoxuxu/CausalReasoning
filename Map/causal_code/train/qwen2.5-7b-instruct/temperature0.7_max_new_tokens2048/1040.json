  "Explanation": "The initial temperature alone does not determine reaching the 'danger' status without knowing the specific increments used to increase the temperature. System status 'danger' is directly caused by the temperature exceeding 100 which is not solely dependent on the initial state but on the magnitude of the increase.",
