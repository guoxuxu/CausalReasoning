  "Explanation": "Stopping the rain only changes the raining variable in the WeatherSimulator's state. High snow likelihood is determined by both sub-zero temperatures and raining. The absence of rain due to intervention does not confirm the previous state of these combined conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Stopping the rain may indicate that the weather simulator previously had isRaining true, which, combined with low temperature, could have increased checkSnowLikelihood. However, checkSnowLikelihood only being true requires both temperature < 0 and isRaining to be true, so stopping the rain alone does not necessarily mean snow likelihood was high."
