  "Explanation": "While the code does turn on the air conditioning when the desired temperature is above 25, it isn't specified that the air conditioning cannot be manually turned on at other times or under different conditions not shown in the provided code snippet. Therefore, we can't conclusively infer this from the given code alone.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
