  "Problem": "def update_price(price, quantity, discount_flag): \n    if discount_flag: \n        new_price = price * 0.9 \n    else: \n        new_price = price \n    total_cost = new_price * quantity \n    return total_cost\",\n\nIf an intervention sets discount_flag to False, and we observe an increase in price, will there be an increase in total_cost as a result?",
  "Explanation": "With discount_flag set to False, new_price equals price. Any increase in price directly affects new_price and hence increases the total_cost (since total_cost = new_price * quantity) and the quantity remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
