  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulation {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        boolean isCloudy = true;\n        boolean willRain = isCloudy && Math.random() > 0.5;\n        boolean hasUmbrella = willRain && Math.random() > 0.3;\n        System.out.println(\"Is it necessary to carry an umbrella? \" + hasUmbrella);\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf an intervention ensures it is sunny, will this change the necessity of carrying an umbrella?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, the need for an umbrella ('hasUmbrella') directly depends on it raining ('willRain'). If an intervention makes it sunny, which directly implies it is not cloudy ('isCloudy' = false), then it will not rain, and thus the 'hasUmbrella' variable will be false.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
