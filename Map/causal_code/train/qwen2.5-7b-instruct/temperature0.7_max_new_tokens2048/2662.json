  "Explanation": "The checkWeather() method sets the outdoorEvent to true if weatherCondition is not rainy (assuming sunny as 1 which does not equal 2). Therefore, changing the condition to sunny directly causes the outdoor event to happen.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
