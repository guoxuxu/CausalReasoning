  "Explanation": "The `is_safe_to_cross` function returns `True` for green light and can return `True` if the yellow light's duration is less than 5 seconds. If `safety` is `False`, the function must have returned `False`, indicating that none of the conditions for `True` were met, including light color being red.",
