  "Problem": "def compute_score(health, age, medication_status):\n    base_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_score -= (age - 50) * 0.75\n    if health < 5:\n        base_score -= (5 - health) * 20\n    if medication_status == True:\n        base_score += 20\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf a patient starts taking medication where they hadn't before, is it predicted that the `base_score` will increase?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, if `medication_status` changes from False to True, 20 points are added to the `base_score`. This intervention directly causes the score to increase, independent of other variables (age and health) remaining the same.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
