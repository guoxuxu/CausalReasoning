  "Explanation": "The code specifies a weight increase only if the calorie intake per meal exceeds 700 calories. Therefore, consuming fewer than 700 calories doesn't directly decrease the weight, but rather, prevents the incremental weight increase that happens with high-calorie meals.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
