  "Explanation": "Intervening to add temperature data enables the calculation of the 'temp_celsius' column within the 'process_data' function. Only with the presence of 'temperature' input, does the 'temp_celsius' calculation occur.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
