  "Explanation": "A higher 'result' implies that the squares and absolute values of the deviations from the mean are large, which could be due to high dispersion in the 'data' around its mean, not necessarily because the original values were high. 'data' could contain both large and small numbers leading to a high average difference from the mean.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
