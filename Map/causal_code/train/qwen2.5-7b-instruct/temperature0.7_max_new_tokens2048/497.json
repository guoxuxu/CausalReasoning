  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate \n    total_price = price + tax_amount - discount \n    demand = max(0, 100 - total_price) \n    return total_price, demand\n\nprice = 100 \ntax_rate = 0.05 \ndiscount = 10 \n\nrevenue, demand = compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount) \n\n# Implement a promotional campaign \ndef promotion_effect(demand):\n    new_demand = demand + 20 \n    return new_demand\n\n# Calculate new demand after promotion \nnew_demand = promotion_effect(demand)\",\n\nIf the initial price increases, will the demand decrease without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "In the given code, an increase in price results in an increase in total_price, which leads to a decrease in demand since demand is calculated as 100 minus the total_price. This decrease occurs without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in price leads to an increase in tax amount, which in turn leads to an increase in total price, resulting in a decrease in demand."
