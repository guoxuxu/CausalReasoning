  "Explanation": "Although a premium of 2000 suggests a high risk factor (greater than 5), it could be either because the individual is a smoker (smoker = 1 or 2) or because the squared age factor multiplied by 0.05 results in a value that pushes the risk factor above 5. The smoker status alone cannot be conclusively determined just from knowing the insurance premium without intervention.",
