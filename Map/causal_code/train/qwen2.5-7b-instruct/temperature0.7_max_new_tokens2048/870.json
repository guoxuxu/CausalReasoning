  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 105 degrees can trigger evaporation conditionally on the method check_evaporation being called. However, the subsequent call to decrease_temperature reduces it by 5 degrees to 100 degrees, and only the check_condensation method is called. Since the check_evaporation method wasn't called again, evaporation status remains unchanged from its prior state (which we don't have details on). Typically, without any previous data, it should be considered false initially.",
