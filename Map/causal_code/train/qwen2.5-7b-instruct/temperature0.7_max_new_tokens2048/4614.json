  "Explanation": "The implementation of a large marketing campaign depends on the sales volume being over 100. While observing an increase in revenue following a large campaign might suggest higher initial sales, it doesn’t confirm it, as the revenue increase could potentially be influenced by other intervening variables not shown in the code, such as discounts or external investments.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Weather influences market conditions, which in turn affect sales volume. Sales volume determines the marketing campaign size, and this, along with sales volume, impacts revenue. An increase in revenue after a large marketing campaign suggests sales were likely over 100."
