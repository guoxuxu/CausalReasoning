  "Explanation": "Observing a reduction in pollution does not definitively conclude that a strict environmental law was enforced, as the pollution might have been reduced by factors not described in the `Policy` implementation, or even non-enforcement scenarios where pollution inadvertently decreases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
