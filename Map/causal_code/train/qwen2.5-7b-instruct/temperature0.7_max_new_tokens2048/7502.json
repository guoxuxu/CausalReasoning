  "Explanation": "A smaller final_amount could result not only from a higher discount_rate but also from lower daily_sales or a combination of both. Thus, having a smaller final_amount doesn't necessarily imply a higher discount_rate alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A smaller final_amount can be caused by a higher discount_rate, as the discount_amount is subtracted from the total_sales to determine the final_amount."
