  "Explanation": "The transition to 'Manageable' could either be due to the umbrella just being opened in response to rain or it already being open before the rain was toggled. Hence, we cannot conclusively say the umbrella was already open based on the output change alone.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Toggling rain changes whether it is raining, which then influences the comfort level. The umbrella's state also affects the comfort level. If the output is 'Manageable' after toggling rain, it could indicate that the umbrella was open if it was raining, but other states are possible."
