It includes a variable for the oven's functionality, which can be disrupted, affecting the baking process.\",\n    \"Code\": \"\"\"\ndef bake_cake(ingredients, oven_working):\n    if 'flour' in ingredients and 'eggs' in ingredients and oven_working:\n        cake = 'baked'\n    else:\n        cake = 'not baked'\n    return cake\n\noven_status = True\ningredients = ['flour', 'eggs', 'sugar']\ncake_status = bake_cake(ingredients, oven_status)\n\nprint('Cake status:', cake_status)\n\"\"\"\n  },\n\nIf you observe the cake not being baked, can this confirm that at least one required ingredient was missing?",
  "Explanation": "The cake not being baked can result from either the oven not working or one or more ingredients being absent. Therefore, a non-baked cake does not conclusively indicate a missing ingredient without considering oven functionality.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
