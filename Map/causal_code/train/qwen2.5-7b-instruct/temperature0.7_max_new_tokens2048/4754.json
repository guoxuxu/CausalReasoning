  "Explanation": "Since rain in the system is determined by both high humidity (above 70) and low temperature (below 20), artificially inducing rain when either condition is not met naturally implies that an intervention must have adjusted the humidity or the temperature to meet these criteria.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
