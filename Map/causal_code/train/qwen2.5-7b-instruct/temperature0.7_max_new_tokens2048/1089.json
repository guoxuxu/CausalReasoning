The total sale price is calculated based on the unit price, quantity, available discounts, and whether a promotion is applied. The constructor initializes the variables and the total is calculated with these given parameters. This code exemplifies dependencies between variables such as when a promotion affects the discount applied.\"\n  },\n\nIf the calculateTotal method returns a higher value, does this indicate that the basePrice must have been increased?",
  "Explanation": "A higher return value from calculateTotal could result from several factors including an increase in quantity, an increase in basePrice, a decrease in discountRate, or the absence of any promotion (hasPromo is false). Thus, an increase in the total does not exclusively imply that the basePrice was increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
