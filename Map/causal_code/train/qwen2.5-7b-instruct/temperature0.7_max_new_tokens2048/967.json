  "Explanation": "If decrementing instead of incrementing the result for lowercase characters still results in 'Case 2', it implies that the base (predominantly contributed by uppercase characters) was originally strong enough to keep the result between 1000 and 1500 even with negative adjustments from lowercase characters.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If there are more uppercase letters than lowercase letters in the input string, modifying the code to decrement the result for lowercase characters could still yield 'Case 2' because the initial value of uppercase character contributions might be high enough to keep the result within the range of 1000 to 1500."
