  "Explanation": "While increasing the numbers in 'data' increases the 'mean', the adjustment subtracted from each data point scales accordingly. This can potentially lead to smaller or similarly scaled 'adjusted_data', and because the transformation applied in 'final_data' includes squaring or taking the absolute value, this does not directly guarantee larger outcomes in 'result'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The data values determine the mean, which in turn affects the adjusted data, the final data, and ultimately the result. Larger numbers in the data list can lead to a larger mean, potentially resulting in larger values in the final data and a larger result, but this is not guaranteed due to the absolute value operation and squaring only positive differences."
