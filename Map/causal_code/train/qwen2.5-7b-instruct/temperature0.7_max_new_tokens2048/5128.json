  "Explanation": "The isWeightGain() function returns true when getNetCalories() > 0, which happens when calorieIntake exceeds caloriesBurned. Although it provides a direct causality from the net calorie computation to weight gain conclusion, without showing the breakdown, the causal relation implying more intake than burn is understood.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
