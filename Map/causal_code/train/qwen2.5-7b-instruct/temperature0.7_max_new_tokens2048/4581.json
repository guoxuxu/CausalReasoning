  "Explanation": "Introducing a medication that changes the risk score calculation by lowering the age multiplier from 1.5 to 1.0 directly leads to a lower healthRiskScore for any given age, as the contribution of age to the score is reduced.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
