  "Explanation": "Setting 'is_adult' to True manually overrides the dependency on 'age'. It causes 'discount' to be set to 0.2, which will result in a 20% discount applied to 'purchase_amount', thus affecting 'final_amount' unless 'purchase_amount' is missing.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Setting 'is_adult' to True will lead to a 'discount' of 0.2, which reduces 'purchase_amount' to 'final_amount' by 20%. Conversely, if 'is_adult' is False, no discount is applied."
