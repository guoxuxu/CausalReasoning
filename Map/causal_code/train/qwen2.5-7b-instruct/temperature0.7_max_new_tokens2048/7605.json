  "Explanation": "Records of type 'A' receive a 10% score increase, whereas type 'B' records get a 2 point deduction. Thus, converting 'B' to 'A' increases individual scores, raising the total_score.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Changing all records' type from 'B' to 'A' will increase the total_score because records originally of type 'B' would decrease their scores by 2, while now they would increase their scores by 1.1 times, leading to higher overall scores before applying the bonus factor."
