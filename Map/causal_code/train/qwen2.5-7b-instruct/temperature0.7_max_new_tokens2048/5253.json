  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting the base temperature to 70, we ignore the weather condition. Turning on the heating adds 20 to the base temperature, resulting in an outcome of 90, independent of the weather condition.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
