  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(prices, discounts, tax_rate): \n    discounted_prices = [p * (1 - d) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)] \n    total = sum(discounted_prices) \n    tax_amount = total * tax_rate \n    final_total = total + tax_amount \n    return final_total\",\n\nIf the list 'discounts' contains higher percentages, will the 'final_total' generally be lower?",
  "Explanation": "Higher discounts result in lower 'discounted_prices', which directly decrease the 'total'. Since the 'final_total' is computed by adding 'tax_amount' to the 'total', a lower starting total leads to a lower 'final_total'. No external alterations (interventions) were made to other variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the list 'discounts' contains higher percentages, then the 'final_total' will generally be lower because higher discounts lead to lower discounted prices, which in turn leads to a lower total before tax, resulting in a lower tax amount and ultimately a lower final total."
