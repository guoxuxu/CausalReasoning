  "Problem": "def compute_discount(price, is_member, discount_rate):\n    if is_member:\n        discount = price * discount_rate\n    else:\n        discount = 0\n    final_price = price - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we manually set `discount` to 20% of `price` regardless of membership status, will the `final_price` decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Manually setting the `discount` alters the original relationship in the code and guarantees a discount being applied, which reduces the `price` and thus, lowers the `final_price`. This is intervention from cause to effect.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Price directly influences both discount and final price. Membership status directly influences the discount applied to the price, which in turn affects the final price. Setting the discount to 20% of price regardless of membership status will decrease the final price."
