  "Explanation": "A 'high' risk status suggests 'temp_status' was 'high' and the humidity was over 50. However, the temperature could also be exactly 100 or slightly less if there might be an error or edge case not handled in the initial condition as the code only checks for greater than 100.",

However, a high risk status does not necessarily mean the temperature was definitely above 100, as it could also be due to high humidity when the temp_status is already 'high'."
