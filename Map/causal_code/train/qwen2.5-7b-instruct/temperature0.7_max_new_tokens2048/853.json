  "Explanation": "The 'sunny' weather occurs because the final temperature exceeds 30 degrees, not because the starting value is precisely 15 degrees. The starting temperature being slightly different but still resulting in a final temperature over 30 would still lead to 'sunny' weather.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the temperature using the increase_temperature method determines the weather. The initial temperature of 15 degrees leads to a weather condition of 'cloudy' before the increase, and after increasing the temperature by 20 degrees to 35 degrees, the weather becomes 'sunny'. Therefore, the weather becoming 'sunny' is specifically because the temperature was increased to above 30 degrees."
