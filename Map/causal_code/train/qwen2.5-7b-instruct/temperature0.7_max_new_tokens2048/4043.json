  "Explanation": "Feeling cold depends on the combination of temperature being below 15 and not raining. However, the person might not feel cold due to other unaccounted factors like personal tolerance to cold or other external heating sources.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
