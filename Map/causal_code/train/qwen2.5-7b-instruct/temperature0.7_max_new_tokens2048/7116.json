  "Explanation": "Increasing the initial budget extends the capacity to purchase more or higher-priced items without surpassing the budget constraint. Therefore, with a higher starting budget, more items, especially if pricier, can be purchased which leads to an increased budget used.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
