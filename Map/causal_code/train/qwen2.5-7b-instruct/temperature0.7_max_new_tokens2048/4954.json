  "Explanation": "Although we see an increased rate of removal after applying a discount, this correlation doesn't imply causation—other factors, such as changing business strategies or promotions, could contribute to this outcome. Additionally, the logic in removeProductByName depends on product names solely, not prices.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Higher prices may prevent product removals because they make products less attractive for removal, and applying discounts can make previously high-priced products more affordable, thus increasing the likelihood of removal."
