  "Explanation": "While applying a coupon (changing 'has_coupon' from False to True) leads to a lower final price, the same effect could also be achieved by changing the 'customer_type', specifically increasing the discount in the 'calculate_discount' function. Thus, a drop in final price cannot solely be attributed to the change in 'has_coupon'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The final price is determined by the original price, customer type, and whether a coupon is used. A coupon use can further reduce the already discounted price."
