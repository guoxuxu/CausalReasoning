  "Explanation": "Reducing the number of sales would decrease the total quantity of stock subtracted from the initial stock plus purchases. Therefore, fewer sales directly lead to more remaining stock given constant purchases and initial stock.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
