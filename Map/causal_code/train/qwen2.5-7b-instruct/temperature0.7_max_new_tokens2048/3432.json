  "Explanation": "Adjusting the system load directly influences the performance mode being set. By overriding the calculate_system_load method outcome, regardless of the actual user hours logged, the system mode can be forced to 'High Performance' whenever the system load is manually defined as 'High'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
