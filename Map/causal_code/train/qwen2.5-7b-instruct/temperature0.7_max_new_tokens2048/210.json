  "Explanation": "An increase in total_sales could be caused by several factors according to the code: reduced discounts leading to higher prices after discount, a decrease in the tax rate leading to relatively less additional cost, or higher initial prices. None of these factors alone, such as an increase in initial prices, can definitively explain the increase in total sales without additional information.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the prices increase or the discounts decrease, the discounted_prices will increase, which in turn increases the taxed_prices and thus the total_sales. Conversely, if the tax_rate increases, it also directly increases the taxed_prices and total_sales."
