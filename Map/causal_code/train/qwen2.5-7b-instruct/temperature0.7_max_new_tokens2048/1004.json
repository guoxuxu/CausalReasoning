  "Explanation": "In the code, sales quantities are subtracted directly from their corresponding stock in the inventory. When 'apple' sales decrease, fewer apples are subtracted from the inventory, thus less reduction in stock.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
