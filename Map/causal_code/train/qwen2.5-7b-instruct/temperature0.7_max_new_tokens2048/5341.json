  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(discount, base_price, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        increase = 0.10\n    else:\n        increase = -0.05\n    price_after_discount = base_price * (1 - discount)\n    final_price = price_after_discount * (1 + increase)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we manually set the discount to 0.20 and notice a decrease in final_price, what could be inferred about the season?",
  "Explanation": "Manually setting the discount to 0.20 significantly affects the price_after_discount. However, whether the final_price increases or decreases also depends on the 'increase' variable which is determined by the season. Since the season's effect is confounded by base_price and increase, the change in final_price doesn’t conclusively indicate the season.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
