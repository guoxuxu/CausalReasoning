  "Explanation": "Changing the threshold to 20°C will categorize more days as hot, thus increasing the days when ice cream sales are between 80 and 100 units. Because the ice cream sales are directly set to be high on hot days, this intervention in the temperature threshold will likely increase the number of high ice cream sales.",
