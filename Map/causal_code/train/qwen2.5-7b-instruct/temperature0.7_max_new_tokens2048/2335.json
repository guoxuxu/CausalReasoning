  "Explanation": "In the provided code, each time a grade of 90 or above is added through the `add_grade` method, the student's attendance is incremented by 1, indicating a direct causal relationship where the reception of high grades results in increased attendance.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
