  "Explanation": "A decrease in inventory can result from both sales (sold_units) and from incorrect updates or errors. Without explicit accounting of returns, one cannot definitively say that a reduction in inventory is due solely to sales.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
