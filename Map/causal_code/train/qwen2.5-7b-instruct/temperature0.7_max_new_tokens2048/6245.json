  "Explanation": "Manually turning off the air conditioner affects only the state of the aircon and does not intervene with the logic of setting or adjusting the desired temperature directly. The desired temperature remains unchanged unless specified by another action or method, as seen from the independence of 'desired_temp' assignment from the aircon's state in the code logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Setting the desired temperature to match the current temperature will cause the heating and cooling systems to turn off, which in turn will stabilize the current temperature at the desired level."
