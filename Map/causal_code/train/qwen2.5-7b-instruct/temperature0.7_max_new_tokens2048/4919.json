  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * demand * tax_rate \n    discounted_price = price - price * discount \n    total_revenue = discounted_price * demand + tax_amount \n    return total_revenue\",\n\nIf the 'demand' increases, will the 'total_revenue' increase without changing any other variables?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'demand' directly increases 'tax_amount' since it is a multiplier in its formula, and it also influences 'total_revenue' which includes 'demand' as a factor in its computation with 'discounted_price'. Thus, 'total_revenue' is naturally expected to increase with higher 'demand', assuming other variables stay stable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in demand, price, tax rate, or a decrease in discount can lead to an increase in total revenue."
