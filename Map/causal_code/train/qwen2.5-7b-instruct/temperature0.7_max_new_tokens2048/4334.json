  "Explanation": "While the grade 'B' implies that the score was between 80 and 89, this reverse inference holds only under the assumption that no errors were made in score entering or grade assignment, and that the grading boundaries have not changed. It assumes grades are accurately assigned based on the score ranges defined in 'assign_grade'.",
