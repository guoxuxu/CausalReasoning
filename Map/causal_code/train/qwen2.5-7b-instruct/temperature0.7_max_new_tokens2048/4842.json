  "Explanation": "While stopping irrigation leads to a decrease in temperature, which can affect rainfall, rain stopping cannot definitively determine the status of the irrigation. Rain might stop due to other reasons, such as the temperature reaching 30 or above naturally. Thus, cessation of rain does not directly indicate whether irrigation was turned off.",
