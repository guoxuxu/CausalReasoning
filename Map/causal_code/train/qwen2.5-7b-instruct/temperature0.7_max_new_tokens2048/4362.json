  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { int temperature; int humidity; boolean isRaining; void simulateWeather(int seed) { Random rand = new Random(seed); temperature = rand.nextInt(20) + 10; humidity = temperature > 25 ? 80 : 40; isRaining = humidity > 50 && rand.nextBoolean(); }}\",\n\nIf it is observed that it is raining, can we conclude the temperature was above 25 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "Rain occurs if the humidity is above 50 and a random boolean is true. High humidity can result either from temperature being above 25 degrees or less, as the set 40% humidity can still cross 50 given random factors and other uncontrolled aspects in practical scenarios. Thus, rain is not solely dependent on high temperatures.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature is above 25 degrees, then the humidity will be high (80%), which increases the likelihood of rain. However, rain can also occur if the humidity is above 50% regardless of the temperature."
