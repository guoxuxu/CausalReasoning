  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention - An increase in heart rate could be due to other factors like weight, exercise, or inherent medical conditions. Without additional information, it cannot conclusively be determined that the increase in heart rate is solely due to an increase in age.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Age and weight directly influence heart rate. An increase in age from below 50 to above 50, or an increase in weight, can lead to an increase in heart rate. However, a specific increase in heart rate from 60 to 100 does not definitively indicate a change in age alone without considering weight changes."
