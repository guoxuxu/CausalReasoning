  "Explanation": "Lowering the price can potentially increase sales if the demand is elastic, but it is not guaranteed because other factors might influence sales like product preference, market trends, or competitor actions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
