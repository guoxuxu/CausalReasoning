  "Explanation": "Observing a slower acceleration does suggest the possibility of the vehicle being electric, but it does not definitively indicate that the fuel type has been changed recently. It only suggests the current state of the fuel type as electric, without information about any recent changes or how long it has been in that state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
