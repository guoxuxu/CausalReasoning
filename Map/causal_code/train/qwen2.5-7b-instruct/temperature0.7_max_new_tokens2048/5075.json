  "Explanation": "The output 'Insufficient stock' suggests that initially, the quantity request could not be fulfilled due to lack of stock. If the stock increases (apples in this scenario), it may satisfy the requested quantity, leading the method to process the order instead.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
