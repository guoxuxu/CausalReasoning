  "Explanation": "According to the code, for it to be rainy, it must first be cloudy, which occurs below 20 degrees. Additionally, rain occurs only if it is already cloudy and the temperature falls below 15 degrees. Therefore, rainy weather implies that the temperature had indeed dropped below 15 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
