  "Explanation": "Since the air quality index is directly influenced by the operational status of the factory—higher when functioning and lower when not—the significant decrease in air quality index suggests that the factory might have shifted to non-operational status.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
