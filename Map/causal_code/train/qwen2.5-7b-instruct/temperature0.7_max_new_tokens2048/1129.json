  "Explanation": "The 'validate' function directly affects which data entries are considered for analysis by filtering out entries that do not meet specific criteria (presence of the 'value' key). This filtering directly influences the dataset input to 'analyze', and accordingly, the results produced. The integrity and applicateness of data are directly linked to the results, marking a cause-to-effect relationship without direct intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The validity of data entries, as ensured by cleaning and validation processes, directly influences the results produced by the 'analyze' function. Specifically, entries with valid 'value' greater than 0 are cleaned, while entries with 'value' present are validated, both contributing to the analysis which calculates the average value."
