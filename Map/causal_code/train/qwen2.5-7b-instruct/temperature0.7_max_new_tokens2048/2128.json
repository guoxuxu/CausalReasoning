  "Explanation": "The presence of rain indicates a temperature below 20 degrees AND a humidity over 50, but it does not provide a specific temperature value or range since multiple temperature values under 20 can satisfy this condition.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
