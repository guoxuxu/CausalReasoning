  "Explanation": "Since plant growth is influenced not only by soil quality but also by sunlight and water conditions, it isn't feasible to determine past soil quality from plant growth alone without accounting for or knowing sunlight and water conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
