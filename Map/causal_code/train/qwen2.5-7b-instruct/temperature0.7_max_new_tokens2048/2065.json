  "causal_map_integration": "If no items are added to the shopping cart, then the total price is zero because the sum of item prices is zero, which does not exceed 100, thus no discount is applied, and the total remains the sum of item prices, which is zero. Applying the 'SAVE20' discount code changes the item prices but does not affect the initial condition of no items being added."
