  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(principal, rate, years):\n    if principal < 0 or rate <= 0 or years <= 0:\n        return 'Invalid input'\n    interest = principal * (rate / 100) * years\n    total_amount = principal + interest\n    return total_amount\n\namount = 1000\ndeposit_rate = 5\ninvestment_period = 10\nfinal_amount = calculate_interest(amount, deposit_rate, investment_period)\",\n\nDoes changing the 'deposit_rate' affect 'final_amount'?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'final_amount' is calculated using the function 'calculate_interest', which includes 'deposit_rate' in its computation of 'interest'. When 'deposit_rate' is increased, the 'interest' calculated would be higher, thus increasing 'final_amount'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
