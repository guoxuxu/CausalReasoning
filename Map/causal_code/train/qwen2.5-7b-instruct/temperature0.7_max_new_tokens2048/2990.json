  "Explanation": "Increasing temperature does not necessarily lead to an increase in forecasted_sales due to the combined impact of both temperature and the corresponding discount_rate on sales. While high temperature tends to increase the base_sales, the discount rate applied does not increase linearly above 80 degrees, affecting the final calculation differently.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Temperature influences the discount rate, which in turn affects the boosted sales. Higher temperatures lead to a higher discount rate, potentially increasing sales, while lower temperatures result in a lower discount rate, possibly decreasing sales."
