  "Explanation": "Higher 'reinvestment' is computed purely based on the 'net_profit' exceeding 5000, which is determined primarily by the difference between 'revenue' and 'expenses'. However, 'reinvestment' being high does not necessarily imply that 'expenses' were low; it could also be due to high 'revenue'.",
