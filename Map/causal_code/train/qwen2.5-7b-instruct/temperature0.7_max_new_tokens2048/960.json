The net income depends on both the revenue and expenses.\",\n    \"code\": \"def calculate_net_income(revenue, expenses):\n    net_income = revenue - expenses\n    if net_income > 0:\n        print(f'Profit: ${net_income}')\n    else:\n        print(f'Loss: ${net_income}')\nrevenue = 1000\nexpenses = 500\ncalculate_net_income(revenue, expenses)\"\n  },\n\nIf the revenue increases, will the net income increase?",
  "Explanation": "The net income calculation subtracts expenses from revenue (net_income = revenue - expenses). If the revenue increases while expenses remain constant, the net_income would naturally increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
