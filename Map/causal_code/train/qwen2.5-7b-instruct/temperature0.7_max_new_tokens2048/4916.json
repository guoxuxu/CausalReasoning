  "Problem": "\n  # Python script to calculate insurance premium based on age and health\n  age = 30\n  health = 'good'\n  smoker = False\n  base_premium = 100\n\n  if age > 50:\n      base_premium += 50\n  else:\n      base_premium += 20\n\n  if health == 'poor':\n      base_premium *= 1.5\n  elif health == 'average':\n      base_premium *= 1.2\n\n  if smoker:\n      base_premium += 80\n  else:\n      base_premium += 20\n\n  total_premium = base_premium + (age * 0.5)\n  \"\"\",\n\nIf the total_premium rises significantly, can we infer health status directly became worse?",
  "Explanation": "Multiple factors contribute to changes in the total_premium, including age, whether the person is a smoker, and the base rate adjustments. A significant rise in total_premium cannot independently confirm worsened health status as it can also result from increased age or being a smoker.",
