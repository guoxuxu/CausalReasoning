  "Problem": "def compute_scores(data):\n    age_adjustment = data['age'] * 0.1\n    experience = data['years_of_experience'] - data['years_of_unemployment'] * 0.5\n    base_score = 70 + experience + age_adjustment\n    if data['has_degree']:\n        base_score += 15\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf 'base_score' is observed to be unusually high, is it correct to assume that 'years_of_unemployment' is very low or zero?",
  "Explanation": "A high 'base_score' cannot definitively indicate that 'years_of_unemployment' are low or zero, as other factors such as 'years_of_experience', 'age', or having a degree could compensate and result in a high score even if 'years_of_unemployment' is significant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in years_of_unemployment decreases experience, which can lead to a lower base_score unless the presence of a degree compensates for this."
