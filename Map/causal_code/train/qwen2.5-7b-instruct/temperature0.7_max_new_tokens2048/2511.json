  "Explanation": "Increasing 'traffic' leads to higher 'sales' as the sales calculation depends directly on the traffic value. Since 'customer_satisfaction' is calculated based on 'sales', an increase in 'sales' from higher traffic would naturally lead to increased 'customer_satisfaction', assuming 'product_quality' remains constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in traffic directly leads to an increase in sales, which in turn directly leads to an increase in customer satisfaction if product quality is high. If product quality is low, sales still directly lead to customer satisfaction but with a lower multiplier."
