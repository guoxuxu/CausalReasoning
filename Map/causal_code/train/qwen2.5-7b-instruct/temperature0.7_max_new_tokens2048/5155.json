  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, tax_rate):\n    discounted_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    tax = discounted_price * tax_rate\n    total_sales = discounted_price + tax\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf the 'price' variable increases, will 'total_sales' also increase, assuming no changes in 'discount' and 'tax_rate'?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the price increases the 'discounted_price', even after applying the same discount percentage. This increase in the base amount for calculating taxes also results in higher 'tax', consequently increasing 'total_sales'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in price leads to an increase in discounted_price, which in turn leads to an increase in total_sales, given that discount and tax_rate remain constant. Tax_rate also directly influences total_sales."
