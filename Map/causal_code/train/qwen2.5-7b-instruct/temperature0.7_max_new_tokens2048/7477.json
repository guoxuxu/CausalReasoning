  "Explanation": "The method returns `originalPrice * discountRate` if `isMember` is true regardless of the `firstTimeCustomer` status. Since `discountRate` is 0.2, the returned value is always non-zero if `originalPrice` is non-zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
