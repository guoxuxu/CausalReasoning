  "Explanation": "Manually setting the safety valve to true simulates the condition where pressure is presumed to be over 200. If the temperature is already over 100 resulting in high steam quality, this intervention would result in the alarm going off.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Manually triggering the safety valve can influence the likelihood of the alarm going off because the safety valve is directly linked to the alarm. Additionally, the temperature affects the steam quality, which in turn influences the alarm."
