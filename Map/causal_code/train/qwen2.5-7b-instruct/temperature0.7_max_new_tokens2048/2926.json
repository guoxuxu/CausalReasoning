  "Explanation": "A high-risk status can result from the person being a smoker, not just being over 50 years old. Thus, high risk does not definitively imply age over 50.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
