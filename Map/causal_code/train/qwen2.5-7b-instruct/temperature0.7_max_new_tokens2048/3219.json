  "Problem": "class WeatherForecast {\n    constructor(temperature, humidity, rainProbability) {\n        this.temperature = temperature;\n        this.humidity = humidity;\n        this.rainProbability = rainProbability;\n    }\n\n    willItRain() {\n        if (this.humidity > 70 && this.temperature < 20) {\n            this.rainProbability = 80;\n        } else if (this.humidity > 50) {\n            this.rainProbability = 50;\n        } else {\n            this.rainProbability = 20;\n        }\n    }\n\n    increaseHumidity(value) {\n        this.humidity += value;\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf the rain probability is 80, can we conclude that the temperature must be below 20?",
  "Explanation": "Though high rain probability (80%) occurs with a temperature below 20 when humidity is above 70, it's not the only condition for such probability—it could also happen at different temperatures with alternative logic paths (modifications or other conditions) not shown in this specific code.",
