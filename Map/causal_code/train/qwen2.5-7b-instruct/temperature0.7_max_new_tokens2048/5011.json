  "Explanation": "According to the code, when 'is_heating_on' is True and the current temperature is less than the desired temperature minus the threshold, the temperature will increase by 'increase_rate'. Therefore, 'current_temp' indeed increases.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
