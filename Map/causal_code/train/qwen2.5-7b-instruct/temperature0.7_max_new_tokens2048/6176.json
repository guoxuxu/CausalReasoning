  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, returns): \n    current_stock = 100 \n    for sale_quantity in sales: \n        current_stock -= sale_quantity \n    for return_quantity in returns: \n        current_stock += return_quantity \n    return current_stock\",\n\nIf 'current_stock' is less than 100 at the end of the function, can we conclude there were more sales than returns?",
  "Explanation": "Since the beginning stock is 100, a final 'current_stock' less than 100 suggests that the deductions (sales) exceeded the additions (returns). Therefore, concluding more sales than returns is reasonable.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Sales decrease current stock while returns increase it. Therefore, if current stock is less than 100 at the end, it suggests more sales occurred than returns."
