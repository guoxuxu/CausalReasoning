Can we deduce this was necessarily due to adjustments made specifically to humidity?",
  "Explanation": "The is_rainy_day function considers both humidity (over 70) and temperature (under 50). Thus, high humidity alone is not sufficient without an accompanying low temperature, which may be influenced by other operations.",
