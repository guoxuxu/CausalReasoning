  "Problem": "def compute_discount(price, is_member):\n    if is_member:\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0.02\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf you manipulate the code to give a flat discount of 5% irrespective of membership, will this change affect the difference in final prices for members and non-members?",
  "Explanation": "Originally, members and non-members had different discount rates (10% and 2% respectively). By changing both to a flat 5%, the difference in discounts observed between members and non-members is eliminated, resulting in the same final price for both, provided the price of the item is the same.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "is_member directly influences final_price through discount. When is_member is true, the discount is 10%, otherwise it's 2%. Changing the code to give a flat 5% discount will eliminate the difference in final prices between members and non-members."
