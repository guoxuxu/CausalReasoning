  "Explanation": "Observing precipitation suggests that both conditions in the predictPrecipitation() method are met (humidity > 85 and temperature < 20). However, without information specifically about the temperature, one cannot definitively conclude about the humidity alone; both conditions are jointly considered.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
