  "Explanation": "While it's possible that more data naturally meets the original stringent validation conditions, if there is a notable increase in the frequency of non-None returns under unchanged input conditions, it could suggest that 'validate_data' has been modified to be less stringent, thus allowing more data to pass as valid.",
