  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, coupon_code):\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == 'SAVE10':\n        discount = 10\n    elif coupon_code == 'SAVE20':\n        discount = 20\n    total_price = price - discount\n    return total_price\n\ndef main():\n    final_price = calculate_discount(100, 'SAVE10')\n    print('Final price:', final_price)\n\nmain()\",\n\nIf the coupon code is 'SAVE20', will the total_price be less than when the coupon code is 'SAVE10'?",
  "Explanation": "The function 'calculate_discount' offers a greater discount with 'SAVE20' (20) compared to 'SAVE10' (10), resulting in a lower total_price when using 'SAVE20'. This follows directly from the function's explicit mapping of coupon codes to discount values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The coupon code directly influences the discount, which in turn directly influences the total price. The original price also directly influences the total price."
