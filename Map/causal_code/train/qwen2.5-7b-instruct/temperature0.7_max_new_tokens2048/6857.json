  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: If the final_score remains unchanged despite increasing the score_multiplier, it implies that other parameters must have changed in a way that exactly offsets the effect of the increased score_multiplier. Possible changes include decreasing the base_score, adding a bonus becoming ineffective, or an increase in penalty.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
