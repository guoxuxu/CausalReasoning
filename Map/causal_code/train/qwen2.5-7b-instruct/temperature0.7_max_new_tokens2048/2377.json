  "Explanation": "Changing the discount strategy from `no_discount` to `percentage_discount` introduces a discount to the product price. A 20% discount on the price will reduce the `final_price_no_discount`, which will no longer apply no discount but a different strategy instead.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Changing the discount strategy from no_discount to percentage_discount will increase final_price_no_discount because no_discount does not apply any discount while percentage_discount applies a 20% discount."
