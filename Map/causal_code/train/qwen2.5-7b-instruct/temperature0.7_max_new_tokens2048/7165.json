  "Explanation": "Alice's initial score is 98. The function adds a bonus of 5 points to Alice's score, making it 103. Despite any subsequent changes, the initial increase is apparent.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
