  "Explanation": "Increasing the base_sales directly increases the seasonal_sales since it is directly used in its calculation within the predict_sales method (seasonal_sales = self.base_sales * self.season_factor). There is no intervention, as other class variables like season_factor and advertisement_spending remain unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "base_sales → seasonal_sales; advertisement_spending → influenced_sales; seasonal_sales → predict_sales; influenced_sales → predict_sales",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in base_sales will directly increase seasonal_sales, which in turn will directly increase predict_sales. An increase in advertisement_spending will directly increase influenced_sales, which also directly increases predict_sales."
