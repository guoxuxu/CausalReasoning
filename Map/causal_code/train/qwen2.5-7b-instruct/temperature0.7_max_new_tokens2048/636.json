  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'age' in data and data['age'] > 18:\n        data['adult'] = True\n        if data['income'] > 50000:\n            data['tax_bracket'] = 'high'\n        else:\n            data['tax_bracket'] = 'low'\n    else:\n        data['adult'] = False\n        data['tax_bracket'] = 'none'\n    return data\",\n\nGiven a 'tax_bracket' output of 'high', can we intervene to assess whether the input 'age' was definitely greater than 18?",
  "Explanation": "Seeing 'tax_bracket' set to 'high' requires both the 'adult' flag to be True and 'income' over 50000. Since 'adult' is True only if 'age' is over 18, this indirectly confirms that 'age' was greater than 18.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
