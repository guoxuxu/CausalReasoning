  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'discount' in data:\n        price = data['price'] * (1 - data['discount'])\n    else:\n        price = data['price']\n    if price > 20:\n        shipping = 5\n    else:\n        shipping = 2\n    total_cost = price + shipping\n    return total_cost\",\n\nIf the function process_data returns a lower total_cost, could it have been triggered by a discount in the input data?",
  "Explanation": "In the function, if there is a 'discount' field in the data, the initial price is reduced by applying the discount before any shipping cost is added. Consequently, a larger discount leads directly to a lower initial price, and potentially even a lower total cost if the reduced price does not push the shipping cost boundary.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A discount in the input data lowers the price, which in turn reduces the total cost."
