  "Problem": "{\n    \"CodeSnippet\": \"def calculate_sales(price, discount, marketing_campaign, review_score):\n    sales_volume = (100 - price) * (1 + discount / 100)\n    if marketing_campaign:\n        sales_volume *= 1.2\n    if review_score > 4:\n        sales_volume *= 1.1\n    return sales_volume\"\n  },\n\nIf a marketing campaign is introduced, will it definitely lead to an increase in sales volume?",
  "Explanation": "The if condition in the code that checks if a marketing campaign is active multiplies the sales volume by 1.2, directly increasing sales regardless of other variables (price, discounts or reviews).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
