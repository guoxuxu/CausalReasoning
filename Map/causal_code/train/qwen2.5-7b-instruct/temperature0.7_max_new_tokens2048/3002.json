It includes a variable for the oven's functionality, which can be disrupted, affecting the baking process.\",\n    \"Code\": \"\"\"\ndef bake_cake(ingredients, oven_working):\n    if 'flour' in ingredients and 'eggs' in ingredients and oven_working:\n        cake = 'baked'\n    else:\n        cake = 'not baked'\n    return cake\n\noven_status = True\ningredients = ['flour', 'eggs', 'sugar']\ncake_status = bake_cake(ingredients, oven_status)\n\nprint('Cake status:', cake_status)\n\"\"\"\n  },\n\nIf the ingredients list did not include eggs, would the cake still be baked?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, both 'flour' and 'eggs' are required, along with a working oven, to bake the cake. Omitting eggs means the cake would not be baked.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
