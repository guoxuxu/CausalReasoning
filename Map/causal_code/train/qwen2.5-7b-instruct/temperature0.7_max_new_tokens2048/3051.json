  "Explanation": "In this specific setup, the introduce_vaccine method directly reduces the ill percentage and increases the healthy percentage unequivocally by considering its effectiveness. This directly improves health levels without other factors in the provided code influencing during its operation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
