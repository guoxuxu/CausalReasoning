  "Problem": "class Employee { constructor(name, performanceRating, salary) { this.name = name; this.performanceRating = performanceRating; this.salary = salary; } updateSalary(percentIncrease) { this.salary += this.salary * percentIncrease / 100; } } const john = new Employee('John Doe', 85, 50000); function reviewPerformance(employee) { let newRating; if (employee.performanceRating > 80) { newRating = employee.performanceRating + 5; employee.updateSalary(10); } else { newRating = employee.performanceRating + 2; } employee.performanceRating = Math.min(newRating, 100); } reviewPerformance(john);\",\n\nIf John's initial performance rating was lower, would his salary increase be less, without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "John's salary increase is tied directly to his performance rating via the `reviewPerformance` function. Since the increase in salary by 10% occurs only if the performance rating is above 80, a lower initial rating below this threshold would result in no salary increase, as the condition would not be met.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
