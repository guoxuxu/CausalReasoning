  "Explanation": "While the deposit method can increase the balance if called with a positive number, the balance being higher than zero doesn't necessarily imply that it was specifically the deposit method that was called. The initial balance could also have been higher than zero, or withdrawals might have been less than total deposits made so far.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
