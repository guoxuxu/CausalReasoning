  "Problem": "def process_order(amount, discount_code, loyalty_status):\n    discount = 0\n    if discount_code == 'SUMMER20':\n        discount = 0.2\n    elif discount_code == 'VIPCLIENT':\n        discount = 0.25 if loyalty_status == 'Gold' else 0.15\n\n    total = amount - (amount * discount)\n    return total\",\n\nIf the function is called with a higher amount and 'SUMMER20' as the discount code, will the returned total be lower?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the purchase amount with the same discount rate results in a higher total cost after the discount is applied, even if the actual dollar value saved increases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in amount leads to a higher total. SUMMER20 discount_code results in a discount, which reduces the total. Loyalty_status affects the discount for VIPCLIENT code, thus influencing the total. Therefore, a higher amount and SUMMER20 discount_code will generally result in a lower total."
