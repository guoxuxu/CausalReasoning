  "Problem": "def process_order(user, item, discount_code=None):\n    price = item.price\n    if discount_code:\n        if verify_discount(discount_code):\n            price *= 0.9\n    if user.is_premium_member:\n        price *= 0.95\n    update_inventory(item)\n    return price\n\ndef verify_discount(code):\n    valid_codes = {'SAVE10', 'OFF20'}\n    return code in valid_codes\n\ndef update_inventory(item):\n    item.stock -= 1\",\n\nIf we observe an updated item stock, can we infer that process_order was definitely called for that item?",
  "Explanation": "The function process_order contains a call to update_inventory, which decrements the item's stock by 1. If the inventory is updated (reduction in stock), the process_order function must have been executed, assuming no other function affects the item stock.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
