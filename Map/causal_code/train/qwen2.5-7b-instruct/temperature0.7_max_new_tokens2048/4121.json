  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(store_area, competitors_nearby):\n    if competitors_nearby > 3:\n        base_sales = 200\n    else:\n        base_sales = 300\n    enhanced_store_area = store_area ** 0.5\n    predicted_sales = base_sales + (50 * enhanced_store_area)\n    return predicted_sales\",\n\nIf after an intervention that fixes store_area to constant values, there is a decrease in predicted sales, can we conclude that the number of competitors has increased?",
  "Explanation": "With the store_area held constant, the only other factor in the function that affects predicted_sales is the number of competitors via the base_sales condition. Fixing the store_area means any change in predicted_sales must stem from change in base_sales alone, which is directly related to the number of competitors (>3 causes lower base_sales). Thus, a decrease in predicted sales in this case does imply an increase in competitors.",
