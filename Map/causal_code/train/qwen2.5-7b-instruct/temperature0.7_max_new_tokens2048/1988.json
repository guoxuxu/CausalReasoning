  "Explanation": "An increase in car count indicates that the traffic light was green, but it does not specifically indicate whether the light was toggled due to a regular pattern or an intervention. The light could have been already set green without any manual intervention, or it could be following its natural toggle cycle.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map_integration": "When a car arrives, the car count increases. The traffic light's status influences the car count because cars can only arrive when the light is green. Changing the traffic light to green allows cars to depart, which can also affect the car count."
