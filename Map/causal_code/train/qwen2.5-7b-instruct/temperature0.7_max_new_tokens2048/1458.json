  "Explanation": "Since the original code categorizes 'high' risk only for ages above 50, observing a 'high' risk for individuals under 25 post-intervention strongly suggests that this new categorization resulted from the newly added condition which introduces this specific effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
