  "Explanation": "Net profit can decrease due to factors other than a decrease in revenue, such as increased costs or increased tax rates. A decrease in revenue is one possible cause but not the only one, hence seeing a decrease in net profit doesn't necessarily mean that there was a decrease in revenue.",
