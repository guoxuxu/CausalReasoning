  "Explanation": "Doubling the daily steps through apply_intervention changes the steps to 8000 and adjusts the heart rate to 99 (110 * 0.9). Despite these interventions, since the original condition checks heart rate AFTER checking for age and daily steps threshold, the person will still be classified based on the original data and still meets the 'At risk' condition.",
