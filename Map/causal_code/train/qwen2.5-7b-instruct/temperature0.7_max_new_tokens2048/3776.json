  "Explanation": "The code shows a fixed increment in crop yield by 20 units when fertilizer is added (cropYield += 20 when fertilizerAdded). Hence, for any given similar conditions of sunlight and rain, adding fertilizer will always increase the yield.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Adding fertilizer increases crop yield, and both sunlight hours and rainfall also increase crop yield. Therefore, with the same sunlight and rain conditions, adding fertilizer will likely result in a higher crop yield."
