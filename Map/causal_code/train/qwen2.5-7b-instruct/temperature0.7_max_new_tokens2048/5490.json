  "Explanation": "With the intervention of manually disabling high_score_bonus_enabled, reaching a final_score of 100 can still occur due to a high initial base_score and/or adequate additional bonuses, not necessarily needing an original base_score to be over 90. Other combinations can also achieve this capped score.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If high_score_bonus_enabled is true and base_score is greater than 90, bonus increases by 20; otherwise, the value of bonus remains unchanged. The final_score is determined by summing base_score, bonus, and subtracting penalty, with a cap at 100."
