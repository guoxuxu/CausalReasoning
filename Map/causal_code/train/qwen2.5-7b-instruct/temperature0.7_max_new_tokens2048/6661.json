  "Explanation": "A 'pass' adjusted outcome implies the adjusted average is above 65. The adjusted average might exceed 65 even without a bonus—especially if the original scores were high enough. Hence, a 'pass' does not necessarily mean a bonus was applied.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying a positive bonus (bonus → adjusted_scores) leads to an increase in adjusted average scores (adjusted_scores → adjusted_average), which can result in an 'adjusted_pass' outcome if the new average exceeds 65."
