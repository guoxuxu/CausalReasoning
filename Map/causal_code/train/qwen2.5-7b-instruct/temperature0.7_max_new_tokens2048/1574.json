  "Problem": "class WeatherTracker { var weatherType: String = 'sunny' func updateWeather(t: String) { weatherType = t } func shouldTakeUmbrella() -> Bool { return weatherType == 'rainy' } }\",\n\nIf shouldTakeUmbrella unexpectedly returns false, and later it's identified that changePredictedPrecipitation modifies another internal property that is checked inside updateWeather which prevents 'rainy' from being set, can this explain the false result?",
  "Explanation": "This scenario implies an intervention where changePredictedPrecipitation indirectly influences how updateWeather behaves. If changePredictedPrecipitation modifies a property that is evaluated in updateWeather causing it not to set weatherType to 'rainy', this intervention explains why shouldTakeUmbrella returns false.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
