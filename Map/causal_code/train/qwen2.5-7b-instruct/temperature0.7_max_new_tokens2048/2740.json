  "Explanation": "Applying an intervention by increasing the tax rate directly affects the final price computation in the 'update_final_price' method. The final price is derived from the base price, adjusted for discounts and taxes; thus, an increase in the tax rate results in an increased final price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
