  "Explanation": "Smaller values in normalized_data indicate that the values were divided by a larger number. Assuming no other operations affect the data normalization in the provided code, observing smaller numbers logically points to a larger scale used in normalization. This deduces effect back to its potential cause without any intervention.",
