  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, loyalty_points):\n    if discount > 20:\n        price = price * 0.8  # 20% discount\n    else:\n        price = price * (1 - discount / 100)\n    if loyalty_points > 100:\n        price = price * 0.95  # 5% loyalty bonus\n    return price\",\n\nIf the final `price` is lower, does it mean that the `loyalty_points` were necessarily high?",
  "Explanation": "A lower final price could result from either a high discount or loyalty points, or a combination of both factors. Thus, observing a lower price does not directly indicate that loyalty points were high. This is an example of inference from effect (lower price) to potential causes (discount or loyalty points) without intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A higher discount leads to a lower price, and higher loyalty points lead to a lower price."
