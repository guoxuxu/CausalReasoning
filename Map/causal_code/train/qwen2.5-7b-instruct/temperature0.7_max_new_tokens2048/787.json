  "Explanation": "While the intervention ensures a 'Sunny' status by keeping it from raining and possibly ensuring temperature is above 20, it doesn't imply that the temperature must reach above 30 degrees. The intervention's effect could be achieved by maintaining any temperature over 20 degrees without rain.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "To maintain weather as 'Sunny', the temperature must be kept above 20 degrees and not raining, which can be achieved by ensuring the temperature does not drop below 30 degrees through the `temperatureRise` method, as temperatures above 30 degrees prevent rain."
