  "Explanation": "When the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius, the update_weather method will set is_raining to False, regardless of humidity. Since is_raining turns False, the water_plants method will return 'Watering plants'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
