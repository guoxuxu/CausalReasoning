  "Problem": "def analyze_data(data): \n    if 'temperature' in data: \n        temp = data['temperature'] \n        if temp > 30: \n            result = 'hot' \n        else: \n            result = 'cold' \n    else: \n        result = 'data missing' \n    if 'humidity' in data: \n        humidity = data['humidity'] \n        if humidity > 70: \n            comfort = 'humid' \n        else: \n            comfort = 'dry' \n    else: \n        comfort = 'data missing' \n    return result, comfort\",\n\nIf you were to observe the variable 'comfort' assigned the value 'humid', can you intervene to make the 'result' variable become 'hot' by modifying 'humidity'?",
  "Explanation": "Changing 'humidity' affects only the 'comfort' variable according to the given code structure. There is no code-dependent link between 'humidity' and 'result', as these are controlled by separate and independent checks within the function. Therefore, manipulating 'humidity' does not influence the value of 'result'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "humidity > 70 → comfort = 'humid'; temperature > 30 → result = 'hot'",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing humidity above 70% will make the comfort 'humid', and increasing temperature above 30 will make the result 'hot'. To change the result to 'hot' when comfort is 'humid', the temperature needs to be increased to above 30 while keeping humidity above 70."
