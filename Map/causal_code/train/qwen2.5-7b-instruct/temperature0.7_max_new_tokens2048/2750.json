  "Explanation": "Reducing the humidity itself may not necessarily decrease the rain likelihood, as the rain likelihood is dependent on both temperature and humidity in combination. Without specific ranges falling under each condition, simply reducing humidity does not guarantee a lower likelihood.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
