  "Explanation": "Changing behavior in non-electric cars to simulate electric ones doesn't change the fundamental property of a Tesla being electric, which determines its sound to be 'Whirring'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The car's brand determines whether it is electric, which in turn determines the sound during engine start. An electric Tesla will produce a 'Whirring' sound, while a non-electric Tesla would normally produce a 'Vroom' sound. However, a malfunction causing non-electric cars to behave like electric ones would result in a non-electric Tesla producing a 'Whirring' sound instead of a 'Vroom'. Therefore, under the described malfunction, a 'Tesla' will emit 'Vroom' only if it is actually electric."
