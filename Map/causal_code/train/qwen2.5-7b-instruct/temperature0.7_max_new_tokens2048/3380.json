  "Explanation": "Assuming that avg_humidity is already calculated and exceeds 50, artificially setting max_temp above 30 changes warning_level to 'high'. This scenario is an example of how altering a direct cause (max_temp) within the system, assuming all other conditions are met (avg_humidity > 50), will affect the output (warning_level).",
