  "Explanation": "While the car indeed accelerates when the traffic light is green, observing the car at a higher speed doesn't necessarily mean the traffic light is currently green. The car could still be moving at a previously gained higher speed from when the light was green before turning red, or other external factors (like manual acceleration not shown in the code) could be at play.",
