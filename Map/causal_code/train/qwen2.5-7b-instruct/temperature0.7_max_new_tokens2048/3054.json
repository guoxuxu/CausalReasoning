  "Explanation": "Calling the 'add_funds' method increases the total funds in the portfolio. Once funds exceed 100000, the 'adjust_risk_profile' method is triggered within 'add_funds', which updates the risk profile to 'High'. This is a direct causal link from the cause (adding funds) to the effect (risk profile change) without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map_integration": "Adding funds to the portfolio directly increases the funds available, which in turn directly influences the risk profile to become 'High' if the total funds exceed 100000."
