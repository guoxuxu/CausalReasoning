  "Explanation": "Calling add_stock with a new item increases the item count in inventory from 0 to the added quantity. The check_stock method then correctly shows the updated inventory greater than zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "When add_stock is called with a new item, it increases the item's quantity in the inventory, which in turn causes the check_stock method to return a value greater than zero."
