  "Problem": "def vaccination_effect(population, vaccinated_percentage, mask_policy): \n    if mask_policy: \n        transmission_rate = 0.05 \n    else: \n        transmission_rate = 0.15 \n\n    vaccinated_population = int(population * vaccinated_percentage / 100) \n    unvaccinated_population = population - vaccinated_population \n\n    vaccinated_infected = vaccinated_population * (transmission_rate / 2) \n    unvaccinated_infected = unvaccinated_population * transmission_rate \n\n    total_infected = vaccinated_infected + unvaccinated_infected \n    return total_infected\",\n\nIf we increase the vaccinated_percentage, will the total_infected decrease, assuming no change in mask_policy?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the vaccinated_percentage reduces the proportion of unvaccinated people who have a higher rate of becoming infected, thus lowering the total number of infections.",
