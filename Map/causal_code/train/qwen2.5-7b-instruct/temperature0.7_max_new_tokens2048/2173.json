Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the discount code '10OFF' decreases the total. Adding or removing items updates the total, which is necessary for applying the discount code '10OFF'. Therefore, under all circumstances where the discount code '10OFF' is applied, the total will decrease unless there are no items in the basket to begin with."
