  "Explanation": "Per the implementation in 'updateHealthStatus', updating a patient's health to 'critical' is a direct cause for labeling them as high risk. Since a younger patient being high risk cannot be due to age, it must be due to a 'critical' health status update, as the code does not provide any other means to label them as high risk outside of these conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
