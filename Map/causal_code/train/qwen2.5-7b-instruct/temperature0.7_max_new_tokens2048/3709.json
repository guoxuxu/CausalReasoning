  "Explanation": "If scores are uniformly increased, both filtered and non-filtered entries are affected, which alters the mean. This modification distorts the relationship between the original data and the 'filter_threshold' and thus one cannot accurately infer the original 'filter_threshold' solely based on the new mean.",
