  "Explanation": "When the traffic light is manually set to red through 'set_traffic_light()', and the condition 'if color == 'Red' and self.number_of_cars < 5' is met, it deducts 2 cars. Thus, this demonstrates a direct intervention where setting the light to red (cause) affects the number of cars (effect) under certain conditions (fewer than 5 cars).",
