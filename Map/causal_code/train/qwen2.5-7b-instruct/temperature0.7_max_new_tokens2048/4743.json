  "Explanation": "The result variable is calculated as z multiplied by y. The value of z depends on the value of x and the condition 'flag'. Regardless of the 'flag' state (True or False), an increase in 'x' will increase 'z' (either as '2*x' or 'x+5'), and hence, if y remains constant, 'result' will increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
