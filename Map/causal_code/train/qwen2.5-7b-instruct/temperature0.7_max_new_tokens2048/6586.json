  "Explanation": "Increasing the budget will lead to higher sales since the `adjust_budget` method increases the budget and calls `evaluate_impact`, which calculates sales based on the increased budget. The sales_curve remains constant without changing effectiveness.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
