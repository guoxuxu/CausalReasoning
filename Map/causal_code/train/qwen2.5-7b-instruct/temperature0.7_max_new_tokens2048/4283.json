  "Problem": "def calculate_revenue(prices, units_sold, tax_rate):\n    base_revenue = sum([price * units for price, units in zip(prices, units_sold)])\n    tax = base_revenue * tax_rate\n    final_revenue = base_revenue + tax\n    return final_revenue\",\n\nDoes a higher 'final_revenue' indicate higher 'prices'?",
  "Explanation": "A higher 'final_revenue' can result from higher 'prices', more 'units_sold', or a higher 'tax_rate'. Without knowing changes in 'units_sold' and 'tax_rate', we cannot conclusively determine changes in 'prices' solely based on 'final_revenue'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "prices → base_revenue; units_sold → base_revenue; tax_rate → tax; base_revenue → final_revenue",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Higher prices and units sold lead to higher base revenue, which in turn leads to higher final revenue."
