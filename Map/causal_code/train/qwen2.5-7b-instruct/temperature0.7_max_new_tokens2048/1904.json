  "Explanation": "The categorization as 'Adult' is strictly due to the age being greater than 30. If after manipulating the age value, the category remains 'Adult', it directly implies that the modified age met the condtional requirement (age > 30). Hence, the new age must be over 30.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If data['age'] > 30, then data['category'] is set to 'Adult'. Therefore, if the person remains categorized as 'Adult' after modifying the age to an unknown value, it suggests that the original age was indeed greater than 30."
