  "Explanation": "According to the conditional logic in the `predict` method, for the weather to be predicted as 'Rainy', the temperature must be 20 or lower and the humidity must be above 80, following the conditions directly stated in the code.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
