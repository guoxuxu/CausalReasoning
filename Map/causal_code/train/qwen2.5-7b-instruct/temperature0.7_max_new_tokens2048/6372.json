  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, rate_increase, special_deal, day_of_week):\n    if day_of_week == 'Monday':\n        new_prices = {item: price * 1.05 for item, price in prices.items()}\n    else:\n        new_prices = {item: price * (1 + rate_increase) for item, price in prices.items()}\n    if special_deal:\n        new_prices = {item: price * 0.9 for item, price in new_prices.items()}\n    return new_prices\",\n\nCan altering 'new_prices' directly indicate changes in 'rate_increase' without observing other variables?",
  "Explanation": "Changing 'new_prices' could be due to changes in 'rate_increase', 'special_deal', or even 'day_of_week'. Without controlling or observing these other variables, it's impossible to isolate the effect of 'rate_increase' from the observed changes in 'new_prices'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The day of the week, rate increase, and special deal each influence the calculation of new prices through separate conditions."
