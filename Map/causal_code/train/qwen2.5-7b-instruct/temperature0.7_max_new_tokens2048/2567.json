  "Explanation": "Within the code, a method `checkRainCondition` is called whenever the weather is updated. This method sets `isRainy` to true if the temperature is below 20 degrees, thus directly causing rainy weather when the temperature is low enough, without any other intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
