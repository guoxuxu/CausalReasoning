  "Explanation": "If the product_id from product_sell is not found in the current_inventory at all, no subtraction of the quantity from the inventory happens, thus no inventory reduction occurs.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
