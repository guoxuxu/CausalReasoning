  "Explanation": "If getCustomerCount() returns less than 5 after calling newCustomer(5), it implies that the restaurant may not have been open when newCustomer(5) was called, since new customers can only be added when the restaurant is open. It does not necessarily imply that closeRestaurant() was called.",
