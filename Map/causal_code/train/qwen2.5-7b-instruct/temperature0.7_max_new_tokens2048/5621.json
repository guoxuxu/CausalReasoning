  "Explanation": "Temperature being set within 20-30 degrees alone does not ensure a True return from ideal_for_hiking; it must also pair with humidity below 60% to meet all conditions for being ideal for hiking.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
