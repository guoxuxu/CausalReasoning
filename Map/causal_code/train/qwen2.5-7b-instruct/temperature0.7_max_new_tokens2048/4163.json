  "Explanation": "The increase in inventory levels for each item suggests the restock_inventory has been executed, as indicated by the logic where inventory of each item is increased by 10.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "When items are sold (items_sold), the inventory decreases. If the total inventory falls below 5 items, the restock_inventory function is triggered, which increases the inventory for each item by 10."
