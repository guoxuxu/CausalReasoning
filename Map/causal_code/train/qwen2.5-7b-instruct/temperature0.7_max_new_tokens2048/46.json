  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(balance, rate): \n    interest = balance * rate / 100 \n    return interest \n\nbalance = 5000 \nrate = 5 \ninterest = calculate_interest(balance, rate) \nbalance += interest\",\n\nIf the interest decreases, does it indicate a decrease in the balance?",
  "Explanation": "The interest calculation in the `calculate_interest` function is dependent only on the `balance` and the `rate`. A decrease in interest could be due to a decrease in the rate or an untouched balance. The balance is not influenced by the change in interest outright without other external adjustments; it does not automatically decrease when interest does.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
