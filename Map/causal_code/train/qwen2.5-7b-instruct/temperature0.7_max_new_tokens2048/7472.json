  "Explanation": "While turning on air conditioning can reduce the final heat index, other interventions such as an external drop in temperature or a sudden drop in humidity can also lead to a reduction. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that turning on the air conditioning was the cause without additional data.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If air conditioning is on, it reduces the temperature, which in turn reduces the final heat index. Higher humidity increases the base heat index, and if humidity exceeds 70, additional heat adjustment is applied. The final heat index is determined by adding the base heat index (or effective heat index with adjustment) and then reducing it by the temperature reduction due to air conditioning."
