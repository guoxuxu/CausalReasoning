  "Explanation": "The method getTemperature() returns 30 degrees only when humidity is 65 or less. If humidity is increased but remains below or equal to 65, the return value of getTemperature() does not change.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
