  "Problem": "def calculate_health(score, age, medication):\n    base_health = 100\n    health = base_health - age + score * 10\n    if medication:\n        health += 30\n    return health\n\npatient_score = 8\npatient_age = 40\nmedication_taken = True\n\npatient_health = calculate_health(patient_score, patient_age, medication_taken)\",\n\nKnowing the patient's health increased, can we infer he was given more medication than before?",
  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: An increase in health does not definitively suggest an increase in medication, as health can also increase with better scores or reduce in age. Without knowing specific changes in these other variables, we cannot conclusively attribute the improvement solely to increased medication.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
