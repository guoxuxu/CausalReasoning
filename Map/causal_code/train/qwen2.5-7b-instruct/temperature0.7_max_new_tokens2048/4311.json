  "Explanation": "Intervening by directly modifying `self.funds` will directly lead to a different output from `current_balance()`, as this method simply returns the value of `self.funds`. The equality between the current balance and `self.funds` ensures that any internal changes are immediately reflected.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Artificially modifying self.funds will directly increase the current balance because self.funds is directly referenced in the current_balance() method. Additionally, adding or refunding expenses updates self.funds, which in turn affects the current balance."
