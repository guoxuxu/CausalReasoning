  "Explanation": "Activating an awareness campaign directly adds 1000 to the voter turnout as indicated by the code `voter_turnout += 1000`. This is a designed intervention in the system which invariably increases turnout, assuming all other conditions remain unaltered.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
