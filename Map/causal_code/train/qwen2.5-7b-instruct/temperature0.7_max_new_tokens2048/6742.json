  "Explanation": "Without using the extra feature, the new_metric is directly calculated as 10% of sales, so if sales increase, new_metric, calculated only from sales, will also increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
