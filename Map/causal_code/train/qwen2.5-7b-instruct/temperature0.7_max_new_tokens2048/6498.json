  "Explanation": "Setting `evaluation_result` to zero by direct intervention (such as altering the threshold or results calculation) does not necessarily reflect the nature of `data_samples`. The zero result could be due to an artificially high threshold or a manipulation in the evaluation logic (e.g., an error in the `process_data` function or in how results are counted in `evaluate_model`). This represents an 'effect to cause with intervention', where the data's original nature might not be the direct cause of the observed effect.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting `evaluation_result` to zero implies that `results` were below the `threshold`, which is caused by `normalized_data`. `normalized_data` is derived from `data_samples`, and `transformed_data` influences `evaluation` through `results`."
