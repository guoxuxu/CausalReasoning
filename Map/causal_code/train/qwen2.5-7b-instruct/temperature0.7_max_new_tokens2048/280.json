  "Explanation": "The manual setting of the temperature to 30 degrees post function execution negates our ability to determine the original input for rain based on the temperature alone, as the intervention disrupted the normal function influence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
