  "Problem": "def calculate_health(exp, diet_quality, age): \n    fitness = (exp * 0.8) + (diet_quality * 0.2)\n    if age > 50:\n        health = fitness - (age * 0.1)\n    else:\n        health = fitness\n    return health\",\n\nIf a person's 'health' score is low, does that mean they are necessarily older than 50 years?",
  "Explanation": "A low 'health' score does not exclusively indicate an age over 50. It could also result from low exercise experience ('exp'), poor 'diet_quality', or any combination of these factors. Age above 50 is just one of the possible factors contributing to a lower 'health' score due to the additional penalty in health computation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A person's health score is influenced by their fitness level, which in turn is determined by their experience and diet quality. Age over 50 can reduce the health score by a factor related to age. However, a low health score does not necessarily indicate age over 50."
