  "Explanation": "A decrease in `total_sales` could also result from an increase in the `discount` or a decrease in `volume`. Therefore, a decrease in `total_sales` does not necessarily imply a decrease in `price`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
