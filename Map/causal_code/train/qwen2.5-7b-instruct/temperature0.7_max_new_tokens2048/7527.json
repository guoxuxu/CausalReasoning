  "Explanation": "Manually modifying 'outdoor_temp' within the 'heating_system' function directly influences 'current_temperature' by increasing it proportional to the outdoor temperature's contribution (i.e., 'current_temperature += outdoor_temp * 0.1'). Here, the intervention explicitly alters an independent variable (outdoor temperature), thereby causing a change in the dependent variable (room temperature).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
