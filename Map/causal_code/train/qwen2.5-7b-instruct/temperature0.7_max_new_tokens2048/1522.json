  "Explanation": "A high final grade does not necessarily indicate whether the adjust_attendance function has been called. The function modifies attendance based on days missed, but final grades can still be high due to the original grades and added benefits from attendance not impacted by missed days, or due to low impact of days missed in adjusting grades.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Attendance directly influences grades through the number of days missed, which is adjusted by the adjust_attendance function, resulting in modified attendance that further affects final grades."
