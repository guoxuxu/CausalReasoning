  "Explanation": "Manually invoking `update_temperature` with a positive delta directly changes the `temperature` attribute. Assuming the temperature surpasses 30 and humidity remains over 40, `apply_heat_index` will determine the heat index as 'High'. This demonstrates intervening to witness a change in effect directly stemming from the cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
