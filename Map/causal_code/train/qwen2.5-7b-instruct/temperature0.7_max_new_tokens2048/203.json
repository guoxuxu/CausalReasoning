  "Explanation": "Setting 'discount_applied' to True applies a 10% discount to the revenue, which lowers the revenue after discount, thus directly affecting the net profit calculation as it reduces the overall revenue subjected to costs.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
