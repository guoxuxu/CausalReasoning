  "Explanation": "The `process_data` function multiplies the input by 2 and checks if the result is greater than 100. If `True` is returned, it means the condition 'modified_data > 100' was met. Therefore, the original input must have been greater than 50 for `modified_data` (input * 2) to be greater than 100.",
