  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'final_price' could also be due to an increase in 'price', which increases the percentage-based discount or changes unrelated to 'quantity'. Thus, 'quantity' isn't necessarily increased from 20 or fewer.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the price is present in data, a decrease in final_price could be due to either a reduction in price or an increase in quantity leading to a higher discount. An increase in quantity from 20 or fewer to more than 20 directly causes an increase in the discount_applied, which in turn can lead to a decrease in final_price."
