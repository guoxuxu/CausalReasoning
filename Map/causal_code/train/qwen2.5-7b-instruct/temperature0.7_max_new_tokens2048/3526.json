  "Explanation": "When the engine is started (`startEngine()` method), the `engineOn` flag is set to true, and speed is explicitly set to zero. As such, immediately after the engine is turned on, the speed remains zero unless the `accelerate` method is subsequently called.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
