  "Problem": "def update_inventory(store, item, quantity, operation):\n    if operation == 'add':\n        store[item] = store.get(item, 0) + quantity\n    elif operation == 'remove':\n        if item in store:\n            store[item] -= quantity\n            if store[item] <= 0:\n                del store[item]\n        else:\n            print('Item not found')\",\n\nIn a controlled environment, if you reset the quantity of all items to zero before running an 'add' operation, will the specific item's quantity equal the quantity added?",
  "Explanation": "Resetting all items' quantities to zero and then performing an 'add' operation will set the item's quantity explicitly to the quantity added since the operation adds directly to the (now zero) existing quantity. This assumes no other operations interfere during the process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
