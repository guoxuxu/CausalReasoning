  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount rate directly reduces the amount calculated from the original price, thus lowering the final price, as observed by the 'calculate_final_price()' procedure reapplied after 'apply_new_discount()' method execution.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
