  "Explanation": "Since the external intervention fixes the age at 30 for every customer, variations in 'new_col' can only be attributed to differences in income. Thus, a high 'new_col' value under these specific conditions would indicate a relatively high income.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
