  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, loyalty_program=False):\n    if loyalty_program:\n        discount *= 1.2\n    if discount > 30:\n        discount = 30\n    final_price = price * (100 - discount) / 100\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the 'loyalty_program' setting is changed from False to True, does the 'final_price' change?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the loyalty_program from False to True increases the effective discount by multiplying it with 1.2, which then, if the nominal discount is 25 or more, hits the upper cap of 30% more quickly. This increase in effective discount directly leads to a lower final_price unless the discount was already at or above the cap of 30%.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The loyalty program influences the discount, which in turn affects the final price. The price directly determines the final price. Therefore, changing the loyalty program from False to True can change the final price."
