  "Explanation": "If reducing the temperature results in the forecast changing to indicate rain, given all other variables (like storminess) remain constant, it can be inferred that the temperature crossing below the threshold of 20 degrees Celsius led to the forecast of rain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
