  "Explanation": "In the function 'compute_metrics', 'c' is calculated as the sum of 'a' and 'b'. Increasing 'a' directly increases 'c'. Since 'x' is positive (2 in this case), 'd' is computed as 'c' multiplied by 'x'. Thus, as 'c' increases due to the increase in 'a', 'd' will also increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing 'a' increases 'c', which may increase 'd' depending on the value of 'x'; increasing 'b' increases 'c', which may increase 'd' depending on the value of 'x'; the value of 'x' determines whether 'd' increases or decreases relative to 'c'."
