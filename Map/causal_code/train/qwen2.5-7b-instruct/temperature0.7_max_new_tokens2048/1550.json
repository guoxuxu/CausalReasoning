  "Explanation": "Observing a 'Sunny' weather condition does not specifically indicate that humidity was modified since 'Sunny' weather could result solely from the temperature being greater than 20 irrespective of the actual humidity level.",

However, observing Sunny weather does not allow us to deduce that the humidity was modified, as it is not directly linked in this context."
