  "Explanation": "With this intervention policy, an increase in 'final_price' would lead to a maximized 'discount'. If 'final_price' then decreases, it suggests that the increase in 'discount' isn't solely responsible; rather, a likely reduction in 'price' or 'demand_factor' must have contributed, since the 'discount' has been adjusted to be maximally high already.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
