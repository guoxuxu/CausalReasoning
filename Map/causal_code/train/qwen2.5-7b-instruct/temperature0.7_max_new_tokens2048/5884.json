  "Problem": "{\n    \"PythonCode\": [\n      \"def calculate_costs(quantity, base_cost, transport_cost):\",\n      \"    total_cost = (quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost\",\n      \"    if quantity > 50:\",\n      \"        discount = 0.1 # 10% discount\",\n      \"        total_cost = total_cost - (total_cost * discount)\",\n      \"    return total_cost\"\n    ]\n  },\n\nIf 'total_cost' reduces, does it imply that 'quantity' was above 50?",
  "Explanation": "The only condition under which the total cost reduces due to internal factors in the code is if a discount is applied, which only happens when quantity exceeds 50.",
