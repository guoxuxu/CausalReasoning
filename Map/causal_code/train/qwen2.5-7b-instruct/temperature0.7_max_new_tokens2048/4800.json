  "Explanation": "According to the given code, if 'user_login' is not found within the data dictionary, the function defaults to setting 'user_state' to 'unknown'. Hence, the output does not depend on the 'user_login' value if it's missing.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of 'user_login' directly determines the 'user_state'. If 'user_login' is not provided, the 'user_state' defaults to 'unknown'. The result depends on whether 'user_login' is provided and its value."
