  "Explanation": "The result could also contain even numbers when an even number from 'data_list' is increased by 1 and results in an odd number becoming even (e.g., 2 given in the list becomes 3, which adds 1 to form 4). Therefore, 'final_result' containing only even numbers doesn't imply that 'data_list' consisted solely of odd numbers.",
