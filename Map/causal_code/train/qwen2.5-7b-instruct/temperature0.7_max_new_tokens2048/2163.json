  "Explanation": "In the code, the final grade is calculated as 60% based on grades. Hence, an increase in grades directly leads to an increase in the final score, assuming other factors remain constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
