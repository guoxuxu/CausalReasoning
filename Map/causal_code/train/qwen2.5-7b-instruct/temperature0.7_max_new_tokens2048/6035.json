  "Problem": "int calculate(int x, int y) { \n   int t1 = x * y; \n   int t2 = t1 + 10; \n   if (t1 > 50) { \n     t2 += 5; \n   } \n   return t2; \n }\",\n\nIf x increases, does t2 necessarily increase without altering other variables?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, increasing x will increase t1 since t1 = x * y. As t1 increases, t2 also increases since t2 is calculated based on t1 with additional conditional logic that potentially adds more to t2 if t1 > 50.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
