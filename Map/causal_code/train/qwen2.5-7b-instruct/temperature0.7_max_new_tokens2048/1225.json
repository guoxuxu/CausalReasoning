  "Explanation": "If the values in result are unchanged, it indicates that the operation could not have been 'scale' or 'add', because both operations inherently change the values based on the scaling_factor. The only condition under which data remains unchanged is if the default 'else' path is taken, where operation is neither 'scale' nor 'add'.",
