  "Explanation": "Since 'result' is determined by doubling the 'data' and the output 'High' occurs only if 'result' is more than 10, this can only be true if the initial 'data' was greater than 5. Hence, a high output implies the data exceeded 5 initially.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial data value is doubled to produce the result, which then determines the output. If the result is greater than 10, the output is 'High'; otherwise, it is 'Low'. Therefore, if the output is 'High', the initial data must have been greater than 5."
