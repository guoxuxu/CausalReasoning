  "Problem": "def process_data(data_list):\n    mean = sum(data_list) / len(data_list)\n    adjusted_data = [x - mean for x in data_list]\n    max_min_ratio = max(data_list) / min(data_list)\n    if max_min_ratio > 5:\n        balanced_data = [x + 5 for x in adjusted_data]\n    else:\n        balanced_data = [x + 1 for x in adjusted_data]\n    return balanced_data\",\n\nIf the input data_list is increased, will the returned balanced_data values increase without modifying the code?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the input data_list does not necessarily mean the returned balanced_data values will increase. The balancing depends on the mean adjustment and the condition of the max/min ratio; both could counteract a simple increase in data_list values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "data_list → mean; data_list → adjusted_data; data_list → max_min_ratio; max_min_ratio → balanced_data; mean → adjusted_data",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in data_list leads to an increase in mean, which in turn leads to an increase in adjusted_data. If max_min_ratio exceeds 5, an increase in adjusted_data results in a greater increase in balanced_data; otherwise, a smaller increase occurs."
