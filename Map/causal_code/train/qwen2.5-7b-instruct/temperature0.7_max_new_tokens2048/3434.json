  "Explanation": "In the heat_wave method, an increase in temperature above 30 degrees leads to a decrease in humidity by 10 units. Since weather_effect() calls heat_wave(), an initial increase in temperature will cause a decrease in humidity.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
