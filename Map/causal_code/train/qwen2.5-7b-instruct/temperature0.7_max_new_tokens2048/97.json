  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(item_price, customer_loyalty_status):\n    base_discount = 0.05\n    loyalty_discount_multiplier = 0.85\n    if customer_loyalty_status == 'gold':\n        incremental_discount = 0.15\n    elif customer_loyalty_status == 'silver':\n        incremental_discount = 0.10\n    else:\n        incremental_discount = 0\n    final_discount = base_discount + (incremental_discount * loyalty_discount_multiplier)\n    discounted_price = item_price * (1 - final_discount)\n    return discounted_price\",\n\nIf an increase in 'base_discount' occurs without changing 'customer_loyalty_status', will 'discounted_price' decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'base_discount' directly decreases the 'final_discount' percentage applied to the 'item_price', thereby reducing the 'discounted_price'. This relationship doesn't require any intervention on 'customer_loyalty_status'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in base_discount directly increases final_discount, which then directly decreases discounted_price. Changes in customer_loyalty_status affect incremental_discount, which indirectly influences final_discount and subsequently discounted_price."
