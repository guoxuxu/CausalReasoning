  "Problem": "def update_users(active_users, transactions, year):\n    updated_users = set()\n    for user in active_users:\n        user_transactions = [t for t in transactions if t['user_id'] == user and t['year'] == year]\n        revenue = sum(t['amount'] for t in user_transactions)\n        if revenue > 5000:\n            updated_users.add(user)\n    return updated_users\",\n\nIf the set of updated_users is expanded after an intervention, can we conclude there was an increase in the number of high revenue transactions?",
  "Explanation": "Expanding updated_users through an intervention (such as adding more high revenue users to active_users) does not necessarily mean that these users had more or new transactions. This indicates potential growth in the user base rather than an increase in transaction activity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in the number of high revenue transactions (revenue > 5000) directly leads to users being added to updated_users, which in turn leads to the expansion of updated_users."
