  "Explanation": "Manually setting `normalized_data` to higher values directly affects the transformation in `process_data`, resulting in higher `transformed_data`. Since `evaluate_model` counts how many of these exceed a set threshold, increasing these values will directly increase the `evaluation_result`. This is a scenario of 'cause to effect with intervention', where the intervention is the manual adjustment of `normalized_data`.",
