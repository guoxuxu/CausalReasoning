  "Explanation": "The `turn_on` method checks if the temperature is below 50 before turning on and heating water. In this case, as the temperature is already 100 degrees, the water heater will not turn on or heat the water further since its only condition to activate heating is a temperature under 50.",

  "causal_map_integration": "When the temperature is increased to 100 degrees, it directly causes the water heater to turn on, which then directly causes the water to be heated. Additionally, using a large amount of water can decrease the temperature."
