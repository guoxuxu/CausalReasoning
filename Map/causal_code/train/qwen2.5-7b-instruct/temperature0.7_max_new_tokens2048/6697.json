  "Explanation": "Even with the knowledge that it rained and using an intervention to establish it was not cloudy, the fact it rained under non-cloudy conditions would contradict the logic in willItRain(). This implies either an error in the system or that our understanding of the conditions under which rain happens is incomplete.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If it has rained and we know it wasn't cloudy, then the temperature must have been below 20 because rain requires both cloudiness and a temperature below 20. Therefore, when it rains and it's not cloudy, the temperature must be less than 20 degrees."
