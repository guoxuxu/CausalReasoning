  "Explanation": "The active_status function determines an 'Active' rating only if the person's daily steps exceed 5000 or hours of sleep exceed 6. Therefore, if their status changes to 'Active' following an intervention, it implies that at least one of these conditions about the steps taken or hours slept must have improved to meet this threshold.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
