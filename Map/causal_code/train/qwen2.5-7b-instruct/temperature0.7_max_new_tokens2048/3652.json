  "Explanation": "Setting 'humidity' to 60 definitely puts the humidity level above the 50 threshold specified in the code for a 'high' risk level. Therefore, manually setting 'humidity' to 60 would change 'risk_level' to 'high', assuming all other code and data conditions remain constant.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
