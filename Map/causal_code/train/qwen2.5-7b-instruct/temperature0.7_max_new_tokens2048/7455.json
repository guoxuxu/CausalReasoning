  "Explanation": "Replacing None values with the average of existing numbers affects the elements involved in calculating the mean, but it does not necessarily change the overall mean if the substituted value is the same as the current mean. Hence, the condition 'if mean > 3' may not be affected unless the new mean, influenced by the substituted values, changes relative to 3.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Replacing None values in input_data with the mean of existing numbers changes input_data, which in turn affects mean and std; these changes can alter whether mean > 3, thereby potentially changing the outcome of the if condition."
