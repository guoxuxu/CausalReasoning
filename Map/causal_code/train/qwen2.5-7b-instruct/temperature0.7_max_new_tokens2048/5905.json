  "Explanation": "Even if the temperature is optimal for raining as per the usual logic (below 10 degrees causes rain), manual intervention sets raining to false. Since both conditions (raining and temperature above 15) are needed for plants to grow, plants will not grow.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
