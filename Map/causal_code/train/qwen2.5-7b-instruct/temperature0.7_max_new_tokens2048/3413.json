  "Explanation": "The observation of the plant being 'Unhealthy' could result from several factors aside from not watering at all, such as insufficient frequency of watering relative to the number of days passing or insufficient sun exposure. Therefore, the 'Unhealthy' status alone does not conclusively imply that 'water()' was never used; other factors could contribute to this effect, and intervention by increasing watering or sun exposure could potentially change the outcome.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
