  "Explanation": "Improving health rating above 70 affects the risk classification ('low' remains 'low' if age <= 50), but because the medication is not 'TypeA' and the risk is 'low', the outcome remains 'stable'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
