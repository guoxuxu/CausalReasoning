  "Explanation": "A reduction in `final_total` could be due to multiple reasons such as a higher discount applied (either through an increased `discount_rate` or lower `discount_threshold`), or a decrease in `total_sales`. A decrease in `tax_rate` is just one possible intervention among these.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Total sales, discount threshold, discount rate, and tax rate all influence the final total. Reducing the final total could be due to a decrease in any of these factors, including the tax rate."
