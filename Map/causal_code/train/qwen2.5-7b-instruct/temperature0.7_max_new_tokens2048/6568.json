  "Explanation": "Setting all data elements to zero influences the computing of statistics, specifically the mean, which becomes 0. Since 'infer_results' bases the 'conclusion' on the 'mean' being greater than 50, overriding all data to zero guarantees the 'conclusion' to be 'Normal'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
