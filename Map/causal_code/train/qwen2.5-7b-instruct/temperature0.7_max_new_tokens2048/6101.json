  "Problem": "def adjust_humidity(level): \n    humidity = level * 1.08 \n    if humidity > 80: \n        fan_status = 'on' \n    else: \n        fan_status = 'off' \n    return fan_status \n\nhumid_level = 75 \nfan_output = adjust_humidity(humid_level)\",\n\nIf someone sets the `humid_level` parameter specifically to trigger the fan, can we expect the fan to turn on?",
  "Explanation": "The fan turns on when the adjusted humidity level exceeds 80. Setting the `humid_level` high enough to achieve this adjusted value will indeed turn on the fan. For instance, setting it to at least 74 would result in an adjusted humidity of approximately 80, thereby turning the fan on.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting the humid_level higher increases the humidity, which in turn turns the fan on if the humidity exceeds 80, resulting in a fan_status of 'on'. Therefore, setting the humid_level to a value that increases humidity above 80 will likely turn the fan on."
