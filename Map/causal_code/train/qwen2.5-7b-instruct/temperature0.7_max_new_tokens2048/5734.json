  "Explanation": "A higher infection rate can be caused by an increase in the number of infected, a decrease in population, or a reduction in the effectiveness of preventative measures. Without specific information isolating the change in effectiveness from other factors, a direct causal conclusion cannot be drawn.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Preventative measures directly reduce the infection rate, while the number of infected individuals and population size determine the base infection rate. Higher infection rate indicates less effective preventative measures."
