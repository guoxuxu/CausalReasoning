  "Explanation": "With the intervention of artificial humidifiers, the winter base humidity level rises to 50. If it rains (adding an extra 10), the humidity level will reach 60. This is below the threshold of 80 needed for 'High humidity', therefore the display will continue indicating 'Normal humidity'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
