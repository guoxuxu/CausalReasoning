  "Explanation": "Since applyColdFront() affects only the temperature and doesn't alter the cloudiness of the weather, a false return after lowering the temperature still doesn’t provide information about the original state of cloudiness. It just implies not all conditions (either not cloudy or temperature not low enough even after decrease) for rain were met.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "isCloudy and temperature directly influence willItRain. Applying a cold front decreases temperature. If willItRain() returns false after applying a cold front, it does not necessarily mean it was originally cloudy because the condition for rain (isCloudy and temperature < 20) did not meet even after the temperature decrease."
