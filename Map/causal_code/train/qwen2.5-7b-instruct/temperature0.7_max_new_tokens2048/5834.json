  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'populationInfected' might be a result from the 'applyVaccine' method, but could also stem from other factors such as natural recovery or higher mortality removing infected cases from the population. Without additional information, we cannot definitively attribute a decrease in infection solely to the vaccination method.",

The 'applyVaccine' method sets 'vaccineDistributed' to true and reduces 'populationInfected'. The 'increaseInfectionRate' method increases 'populationInfected', but if 'vaccineDistributed' is true, it also reduces 'populationInfected' by 5% of the population size."
