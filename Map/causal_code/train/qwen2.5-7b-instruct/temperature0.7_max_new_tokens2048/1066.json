  "Explanation": "The transfer process entails that a withdrawal from 'from_account' must succeed for a deposit to be made into 'to_account'. If an intervening action prevents the withdrawal, irrespective of other conditions, the deposit will also not occur because the causal link (withdrawal preceding deposit) is interrupted.",
