  "Explanation": "If BMI appears normal and the score is still low, one possible factor contributing to this, given this model, could be a low exercise_freq, as age and exercise are the other independent variables affecting the health score.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
