  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, stock, discount_factor):\n    if discount_factor > 0.5:\n        discount = price * 0.10\n    else:\n        discount = price * discount_factor\n    final_price = price - discount\n    total_sales = final_price * stock\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf we fix the discount at 10% regardless of discount_factor, will increasing the price increase the total_sales?",
  "Explanation": "With a fixed discount of 10%, an increase in the price results in a higher final_price despite the discount. This increases the total revenue generated from each unit sold, hence, potentially increasing total_sales given that the stock remains constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
