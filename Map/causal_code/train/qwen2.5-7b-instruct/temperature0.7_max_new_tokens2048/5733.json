  "Problem": "def infection_rate(population, infected, preventative_measures=False):\n    base_rate = 0.1\n    if preventative_measures:\n        effectiveness = 0.5\n        return (infected / population) * base_rate * (1 - effectiveness)\n    else:\n        return (infected / population) * base_rate\n\ninf_rate = infection_rate(1000, 50, True)\nprint('Infection rate:', inf_rate)\",\n\nIf we increase the effectiveness of preventative measures, will the infection rate necessarily decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Based upon the formula in the function, an increase in the effectiveness of preventative measures (higher effectiveness value) directly results in a lower final multiplication factor in the formula (1 - effectiveness). This consequently reduces the overall infection rate calculated, thus directly affecting the rate through an intentional intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
