  "Problem": "def compute_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == '20OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == '10OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.1\n    return total - discount\",\n\nIf a coupon code '20OFF' is applied, will the final payable amount decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Applying the '20OFF' coupon code means a discount of 20% of the total amount is taken. As the discount increases the total deductions on the sum of the items (assuming all else remains constant), the final amount payable decreases compared to a scenario with a smaller or no discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
