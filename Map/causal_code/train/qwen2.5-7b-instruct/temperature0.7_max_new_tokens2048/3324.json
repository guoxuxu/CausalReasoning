  "Explanation": "Although introducing a positive 'deltaTemp' typically raises the temperature, if the rain is introduced and the temperature before adding 'deltaTemp' is less than 10, the temperature will be set to 5, overriding the effect of 'deltaTemp'. Thus, even with intervention, under these conditions, the temperature could be set to 5 despite the positive 'deltaTemp'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting a positive deltaTemp increases the temperature. Introducing rain sets isRaining to true and, if the temperature is less than 10, it changes the temperature to 5. Therefore, a positive deltaTemp and rain could still result in a temperature of 5 degrees if the initial temperature plus deltaTemp is still less than 10."
