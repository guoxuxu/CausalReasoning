  "Explanation": "Both adding a significant number of users and updating the system contribute to an increase in system load. While the update provides a minor offset in feedback score, it still results in a net increase in system load.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in userCount directly causes an increase in systemLoad, and if the system is updated, it also directly causes an increase in systemLoad. Therefore, if userCount increases significantly and the system is updated at the same time, systemLoad is expected to increase."
