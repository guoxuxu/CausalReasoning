  "Problem": "def process_data(input_data):\n    noisy_data = input_data + 10\n    filtered_data = noisy_data - 5\n    processed_data = filtered_data * 2\n    return processed_data\",\n\nIf we modify the operation by subtracting 15 instead of 5 from noisy_data, will this affect processed_data?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the subtraction operation impacts filtered_data, which is directly used to compute processed_data. A subtraction of 15 instead of 5 decreases filtered_data and thus decreases processed_data, showcasing the direct intervention's impact.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
