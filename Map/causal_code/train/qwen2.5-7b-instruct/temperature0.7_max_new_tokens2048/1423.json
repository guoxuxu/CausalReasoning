  "Explanation": "Because the air conditioner is off, the condition `this.isOn` evaluates to false. Thus, the method setTemperature does not change the temperature due to the failed condition check.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
