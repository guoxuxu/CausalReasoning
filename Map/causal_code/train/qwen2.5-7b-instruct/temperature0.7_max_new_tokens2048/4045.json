  "Explanation": "The decision to go outside is influenced by the combined condition of whether it is raining and the person has an umbrella. Without knowing whether the person took an umbrella as an intervention, one cannot conclude the rain status directly from the person's decision to go outside.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
