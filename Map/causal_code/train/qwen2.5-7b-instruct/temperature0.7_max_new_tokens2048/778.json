  "Explanation": "The code specifies that if the 'amount' exceeds 1000, 'discount' should be set to 0.1. By intervening and setting 'amount' to 1200, this condition is fulfilled, hence the 'discount' will indeed be 0.1. This checks the understanding from cause (amount being set) to effect (discount rate) with an intervention.",
