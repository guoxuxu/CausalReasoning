  "Problem": "int sales = 200; \nint advertising_expense = 50; \nif (advertising_expense > 40) {\n    sales += advertising_expense * 2;\n} else {\n    sales -= 10;\n}\nint customer_feedback = (sales / 10); \nif (customer_feedback > 30) {\n    advertising_expense += 20;\n}\",\n\nIf advertising expense increases but was already above 40, will sales most certainly increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the given code, there is a direct impact of advertising expense on sales when the advertising expense > 40, causing an increase in sales by twice the amount of the advertising expense. Increasing the advertising expense under this condition definitely increases the sales without any other intervention as per the logic provided in the code.",
