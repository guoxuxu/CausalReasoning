  "Explanation": "Manually setting 'factor' to its original value counteracts the effect of setting 'modify_factor' to True. Hence, the multiplication and the resulting mean (result) remain the same as if 'modify_factor' were set to False.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When 'modify_factor' is True, 'factor' is increased by 10%, which directly increases 'result'. If 'modify_factor' is False, 'factor' remains unchanged, thus 'result' depends on the original 'factor' value. Therefore, setting 'factor' manually to its original value when 'modify_factor' is True does not keep 'result' unchanged compared to when 'modify_factor' is False."
