  "Explanation": "The heart rate being exactly 100 does not conclusively indicate when the person started exercising since it is set as the lower threshold when a person begins exercising. Therefore, the heart rate might still be at 100 from a previous state, without the ability to pinpoint when a change in exercise state occurred.",
