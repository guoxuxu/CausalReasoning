  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(discount, base_price, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        increase = 0.10\n    else:\n        increase = -0.05\n    price_after_discount = base_price * (1 - discount)\n    final_price = price_after_discount * (1 + increase)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final_price is observed to increase, can we conclude the season changed from low to high?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in final_price could also be due to a decrease in discount or an increase in the base_price. Without controlling these factors, we cannot conclusively determine the cause of the increase in final_price is due to a change in season.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
