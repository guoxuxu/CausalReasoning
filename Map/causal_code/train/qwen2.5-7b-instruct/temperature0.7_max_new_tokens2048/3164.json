  "Problem": "class SalesAnalysis { double discount; double price; double increaseTraffic(double factor) { return factor * 0.5; } double salePrice() { return price - (price * discount); } }\",\n\nIf we fix the value of 'discount' and 'price', does an increase in external marketing (implemented as an intervention factor in 'increaseTraffic') affect 'salePrice'?",
  "Explanation": "The method 'increaseTraffic' does not interact with 'price' or 'discount' and hence does not affect 'salePrice' according to the provided class definition. 'salePrice' is solely computed based on 'price' and 'discount', which are static in this scenario.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
