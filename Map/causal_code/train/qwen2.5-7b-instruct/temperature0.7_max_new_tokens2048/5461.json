  "Problem": "Function to determine if health improves based on lifestyle changes and medication.\",\n\nIf we modify the random variability to always return zero, will medication alone guarantee the health score exceeds the threshold?",
  "Explanation": "Without negative variability, medication alone ensures exceeding the threshold.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "medication → health; lifestyle_changes → health",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Medication and lifestyle changes both affect health. Removing random variability and setting it to zero implies a deterministic environment where only the direct effects of medication and lifestyle changes on health are considered. In this scenario, if medication alone is sufficient to raise the health score above the threshold without the influence of lifestyle changes, then yes, medication alone could guarantee the health score exceeds the threshold."
