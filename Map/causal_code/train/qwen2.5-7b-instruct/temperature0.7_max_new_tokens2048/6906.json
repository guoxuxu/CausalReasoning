  "Problem": "def calculate_score(temperature, humidity, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        base_score = 20\n    elif season == 'winter':\n        base_score = 30\n    else:\n        base_score = 25\n\n    if temperature > 75:\n        temperature_score = 5\n    else:\n        temperature_score = 3\n    \n    if humidity > 50:\n        humidity_score = 10\n    else:\n        humidity_score = 8\n\n    final_score = base_score + temperature_score + humidity_score\n    return final_score\",\n\nIf the season changes from winter to summer, would you expect the base_score to decrease?",
  "Explanation": "The function defines different base scores depending on the season. In winter, the base score is set to 30, and in summer, it is set to 20. Therefore, changing the season from winter to summer decreases the base score.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
