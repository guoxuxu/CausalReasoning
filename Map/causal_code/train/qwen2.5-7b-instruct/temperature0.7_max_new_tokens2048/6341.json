  "Explanation": "The adjustInvestment method increases the investment by 20 if the interest rate is greater than 4. Manually setting the interest rate to 7 would thus trigger an increase in investment according to this rule.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
