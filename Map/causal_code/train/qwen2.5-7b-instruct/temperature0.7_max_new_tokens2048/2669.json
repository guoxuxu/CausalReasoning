  "Explanation": "With the modification, the function now appends an output (datum * 3) for odd numbers as well as (datum * 2) for even numbers. Therefore, a non-empty output list no longer indicates solely that the input data had even numbers; it could now contain odds, evens, or both.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
