  "Problem": "class VehicleSystem { constructor(trafficLevel) { this.trafficLevel = trafficLevel; } updateTrafficLevel(trafficLevel) { this.trafficLevel = trafficLevel; this.updateDelay(); } updateDelay() { if(this.trafficLevel >= 80) { this.delay = 'High'; } else if(this.trafficLevel >= 50) { this.delay = 'Moderate'; } else { this.delay = 'Low'; } } } const system = new VehicleSystem(30); system.updateTrafficLevel(90);\",\n\nIf the traffic level is set to 90, will the delay be high without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The `updateTrafficLevel` method sets the traffic level and directly calls `updateDelay`, which sets the delay based on the traffic level. Since 90 is greater than 80, the delay is adjusted to 'High' according to the code logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
