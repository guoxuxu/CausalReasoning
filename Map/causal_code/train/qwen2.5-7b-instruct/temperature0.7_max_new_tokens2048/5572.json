  "Explanation": "The 'redeem' method only checks if points are 50 or more. How the points are accumulated (multiple smaller purchases, or non-purchase point additions if any) doesn't strictly require individual purchases over $100.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
