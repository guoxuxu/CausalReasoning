  "Explanation": "The method `artificialRain` forces `isRaining` to be true, simultaneously setting the humidity to 80, according to its programming. This intervention directly manipulates the state to achieve the described effect, regardless of prior weather conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
