  "Explanation": "Shipping cost calculation is dependent on the final price, not the other way around. The final price is computed based on the original price and discount without any influence from the shipping cost.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "No, changing the shipping cost does not directly change the final price because the final price is determined solely by the price and discount, with shipping cost being calculated afterward based on the final price."
