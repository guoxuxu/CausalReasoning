  "Explanation": "An increased final_sales could be due to a high value of 'sales' itself, even if the growth factor is 1.0 (when 'sales' is not present). Thus, without knowing the initial 'sales' value or the exact growth factor applied, the exact reason for an increase in final_sales cannot solely be attributed to the presence of 'sales'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of 'sales' in the data dictionary influences the growth factor, which in turn affects final_sales. If 'sales' is present, the growth factor is set to 1.1, leading to a potentially higher final_sales compared to when 'sales' is absent, in which case the growth factor is 1.0."
