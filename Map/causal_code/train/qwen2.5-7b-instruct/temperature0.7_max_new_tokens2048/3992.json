  "Problem": "def predict_sales(price, ad_budget, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        base_sales = 120\n    else:\n        base_sales = 100\n    adjusted_price_effect = price * -0.5\n    ad_effect = ad_budget * 0.4\n    total_sales = base_sales + adjusted_price_effect + ad_effect\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf we manually set the ad_budget to 0, how will this affect the total_sales given a high season?",
  "Explanation": "By setting the ad_budget to 0, you remove the ad_effect from the total_sales calculation. The formula then only includes base_sales (which is higher during high season) and the negative impact of the price. Thus, it will cause an increase in the total_sales based on the season's base value and do not decrease it due to the ad_budget anymore.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting the ad_budget to 0 will reduce the ad_effect, which in turn will decrease the total_sales. In a high season, the base_sales will be 120, and the total_sales will be reduced by half of the price and the decreased ad_effect."
