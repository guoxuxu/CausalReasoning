  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data): \n  revenue = sum([item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in data]) \n  costs = sum([item['cost'] * item['quantity'] for item in data]) \n  profit = revenue - costs \n  return {'revenue': revenue, 'profit': profit}\",\n\nCan altering 'cost' values help us manipulate the 'revenue' directly?",
  "Explanation": "In the computation, 'revenue' is derived solely from 'price' and 'quantity' for each item. 'Costs' influence 'profit' but not 'revenue'. Altering 'cost' does not affect 'revenue' calculation as they are not causally dependent in the given code.",
