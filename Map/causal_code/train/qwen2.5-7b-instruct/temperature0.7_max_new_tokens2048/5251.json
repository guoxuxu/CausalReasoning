  "Explanation": "Without turning on the heating system, the function will adjust the base temperature based on weather (cold = 50, otherwise = 70). The heating adjustment, which adds 20 to the base, does not occur if the heating is not turned on; thus, colder weather alone does not necessarily result in a higher temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
