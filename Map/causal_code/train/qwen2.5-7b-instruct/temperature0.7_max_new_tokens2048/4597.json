  "Explanation": "Reducing the 'quantity' directly affects both 'revenue' and 'costs' since they are computed as the sum of products of 'quantity' with 'price' and 'cost' respectively. A reduction in 'quantity' typically decreases both 'revenue' and 'costs'. However, the net effect of these decreases on 'profit' (revenue - costs) could vary, but generally, 'profit' would also decrease if 'costs' and 'revenue' move proportionately.",
