  "Explanation": "In the code, the market status is determined as 'rising' if the averaged trend of the price data is greater than 100. Thus, if the average price increases and surpasses 100, the status calculated will be 'rising'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
