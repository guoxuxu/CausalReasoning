  "Explanation": "A health score of 95 can also be achieved with a base_score of 80 (age <= 50), diet_score of 20 (good diet), and exercise_score of 5 (exercise <= 3 times a week).",

  "causal_map_integration": "exercise frequency directly affects exercise score, which contributes to the health score; good diet quality directly affects diet score, which contributes to the health score; age determines the base score, which contributes to the health score; if exercise frequency is more than 3, exercise score is 15, otherwise it is 5; if diet quality is good, diet score is 20, otherwise it is 10; health score is the sum of base score, diet score, and exercise score"
