  "Problem": "def manage_inventory(item, sales): \n    if item.stock < 10: \n        item.reorder(30) \n    item.stock -= sales \n    if sales > 20: \n        item.create_discount(5) \n    return item.stock\",\n\nIf high sales numbers are reported, did the item likely have a discount applied previously within the manage_inventory function?",
  "Explanation": "The creation of a discount is triggered after checking sales numbers greater than 20 within the same manage_inventory invocation. Therefore, sales above 20 lead to the creation of a discount, not the other way around.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If sales exceed twenty units, then a discount of five percent is created; if stock falls below ten units, then the item is reordered with thirty units."
