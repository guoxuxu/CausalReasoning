  "Explanation": "Speed is initialized to 0 in the Vehicle constructor. Without calling accelerate method, there is no other code in the class that increases speed, hence it remains 0.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If a Vehicle object calls the accelerate method with a positive increment, its speed increases. If it then calls the apply_brakes method with a positive decrement, its speed decreases. Therefore, without calling accelerate, the speed remains at the initial value of 0."
