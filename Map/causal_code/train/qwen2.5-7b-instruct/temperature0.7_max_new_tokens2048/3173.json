  "Problem": "[See above Python code snippet]\",\n\nIf we intervene by adding nutrients to the soil without modifying sunlight or water, and observe that plants are growing poorly, can we conclude that the sunlight was insufficient?",
  "Explanation": "Poor plant growth despite nutrient addition could result from insufficient sunlight or water, or other uncontrolled factors. It is not definitive only to sunlight insufficiency.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "soil nutrients → plant growth; sunlight → plant growth",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Adding nutrients to the soil can influence plant growth, and sunlight also directly affects plant growth. Therefore, if plants are growing poorly after adding nutrients but without modifying sunlight, it does not necessarily mean that sunlight was insufficient, as other factors could be at play."
