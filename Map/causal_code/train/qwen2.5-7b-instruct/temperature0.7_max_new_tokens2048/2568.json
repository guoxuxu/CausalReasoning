  "Explanation": "According to the `checkRainCondition` method in the code, rainy condition (`isRainy`) is set to true only when the temperature falls below 20 degrees. Therefore, observing rainy weather implies that the temperature must be below 20 without any intervention that affects this causal pathway.",
