  "Explanation": "In the original code, the adjust_investment() method increases the investment by 10% when the market trend is 'bull'. Therefore, if the market trend changes to 'bull' due to some external factors influencing the market prediction, investment size will increase accordingly without the need for any additional investment from the investor.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
