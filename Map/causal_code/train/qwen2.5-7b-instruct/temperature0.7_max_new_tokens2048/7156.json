  "Problem": "def compute(a, b): \n    x = a * 2 \n    y = b + 5 \n    z = x + y \n    w = z - 3 \n    return w\",\n\nIf you observe that the return value 'w' is higher, does this allow you to deduce that 'x' was set to a higher value through an intervention?",
  "Explanation": "While it's true that an increase in 'x' (x = a * 2) would result in an increased 'w', the observation of a high value of 'w' does not necessarily mean that 'x' was specifically adjusted through an intervention. 'w' could also have increased due to an adjustment in 'y' or naturally higher input values 'a' and 'b'. Thus, the observation of higher 'w' does not uniquely determine the cause related to an increment in 'x'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
