  "Explanation": "When 'flag' is True, the code explicitly adds 100 to the processed value which is initially calculated as 10 times the 'value'. This makes 'processed' definitely higher than it would be if 'flag' were False or not adjusted.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
