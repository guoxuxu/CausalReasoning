  "Explanation": "The final price can be lower due to either a decrease in the base price, or an increase in the discount rate, or a decrease in the tax rate. Observing a lower final price does not exclusively indicate that the base price decreased, as other factors (discount and tax) also influence the final price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
