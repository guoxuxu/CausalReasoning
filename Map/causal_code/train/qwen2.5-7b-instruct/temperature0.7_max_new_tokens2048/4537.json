  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, season):\n    if season == 'holiday':\n        discount_rate += 0.05\n    final_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate)\n    tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate\n    total_price = final_price + tax_amount\n    return total_price\",\n\nIf we intervene to set the discount rate to zero during a non-holiday season, will the final price equal the base price?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the discount rate to zero means that the final price formula becomes base_price * (1 - 0), which simplifies to base_price. Since it is not a holiday season, there is no additional increment to the discount rate, which allows us to directly conclude that final_price equals base_price when discount rate is zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "During a non-holiday season, setting the discount rate to zero directly reduces the final price to the base price, as the final price is calculated based on the base price minus the discount rate, and tax amount and total price are derived from the final price."
