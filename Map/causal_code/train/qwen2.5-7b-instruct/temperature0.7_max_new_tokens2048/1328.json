  "Explanation": "A 'Calm' mood is directly determined by the humidity being over 70 in the 'check_mood_change' method of the MoodDetector class. Although high temperatures can increase humidity, a calm mood can occur due to humidity affects that are not necessarily tied to current temperature readings.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
