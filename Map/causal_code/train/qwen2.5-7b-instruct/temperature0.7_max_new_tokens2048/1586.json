  "Explanation": "Observing a higher final_price and testing by resetting the tax_rate to a known default can help determine whether the increase was due to an initially higher tax_rate. By controlling the tax_rate (intervention) and observing changes in final_price, one can causally link unexpected increases in final_price to variations in the tax_rate.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The base price, discount, and tax rate directly influence the final price. Specifically, the base price and discount reduce the price before tax is applied, while the tax rate determines the amount of tax added to the discounted price."
