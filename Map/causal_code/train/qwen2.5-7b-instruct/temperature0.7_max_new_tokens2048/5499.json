  "Problem": "def compute_impact(sales, marketing_budget, economy_index):\n    if economy_index > 50:\n        sales += sales * 0.1\n    else:\n        sales += sales * 0.05\n    if marketing_budget > 1000:\n        sales += sales * 0.2\n    return sales\",\n\nIf the economy index increases, will sales likely increase, assuming no other changes?",
  "Explanation": "The code indicates that if the economy index is greater than 50, sales are increased by 10%. Therefore, an increase in the economy index above 50 directly increases sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in the economy index is likely to increase sales, while a higher marketing budget also tends to boost sales. Both factors positively influence sales independently."
