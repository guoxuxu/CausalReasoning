  "Explanation": "An increase in temperature could be due to either the heating being turned on or a change from 'cold' weather to 'warm'. Without information about the weather, the specific cause of the temperature rise (heating or weather change) cannot be determined.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
