  "Explanation": "The forceOutdoorEvent() method checks if the weather condition is rainy, and if so, sets the useUmbrellas flag to true. This is a straightforward intervention where changing the execution flow causes umbrellas to be used when forcing an outdoor event despite rainy conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The weather condition directly influences whether an outdoor event occurs and whether umbrellas are used. If the weather is rainy (weatherCondition = 2), an outdoor event will not occur (outdoorEvent = false) but umbrellas will be used (useUmbrellas = true). Conversely, if the weather is sunny (weatherCondition = 1), an outdoor event will occur (outdoorEvent = true) and umbrellas will not be used (useUmbrellas = false). Additionally, if an outdoor event is forced regardless of the weather, umbrellas will be used if it is raining."
