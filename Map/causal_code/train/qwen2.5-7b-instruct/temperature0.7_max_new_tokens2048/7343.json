  "Explanation": "Manually turning the air conditioner on (if it were allowed by an additional method which is not present in the code) does not change the 'temperature' field in the class because the 'temperature' variable is set during instantiation and only accessible via the 'setTemperature' method, which is explicitly stated as non-functional ('Simulation does not actually change temperature').",
