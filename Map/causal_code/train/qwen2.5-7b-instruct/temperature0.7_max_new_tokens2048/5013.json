  "Explanation": "The code dictates that if 'is_heating_on' is True and 'current_temp' is below the 'desired_temp' minus 'threshold', then 'current_temp' should increase regardless of any external influences decreasing the temperature. The heating will act to increase the 'current_temp' as per the increase rate specified in the settings.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

An external decrease in 'current_temp' will not prevent this increase as long as 'is_heating_on' remains true."
