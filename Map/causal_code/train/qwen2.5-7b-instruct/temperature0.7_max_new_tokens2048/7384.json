  "Explanation": "A lower final price could also be due to a lower `seasonal_factor` which can occur independently of the units sold. Additionally, the number of units sold affects the discount only when exceeding 500 units, therefore this specific condition must be met for discounts to apply.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If more units are sold, then a discount is applied which reduces the final price. The current month influences the seasonal factor, which in turn affects the final price. A higher base price leads to a higher final price, and a higher seasonal factor also increases the final price."
