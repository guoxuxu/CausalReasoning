  "Explanation": "A decrease in bonuses awarded can be due to either a higher bonus_threshold or lower sales figures across products. Without additional information, a decrease in bonuses awarded alone does not definitively indicate an increase in bonus_threshold.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
