  "Problem": "class TrafficSystem { constructor() { this.signal = 'red'; this.cars = 0; } changeSignal(newSignal) { this.signal = newSignal; } updateCars(count) { this.cars += count; } canDrive() { return this.signal === 'green'; } } const cityTraffic = new TrafficSystem(); cityTraffic.changeSignal('green'); cityTraffic.updateCars(5); const isDrivingPossible = cityTraffic.canDrive();\",\n\nIf cars are observed driving, can we infer the traffic signal was green?",
  "Explanation": "Observing cars driving suggests the traffic signal must be green, because cars can only drive when the signal is green. This is deducing the cause (signal being green) from the effect (cars driving) without intervening but assuming no other rules allow cars to move (e.g., a different override in place).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The traffic signal being green (indicated by `canDrive` returning true) allows cars to drive, and updating the number of cars does not directly cause the signal to change or affect driving possibility."
