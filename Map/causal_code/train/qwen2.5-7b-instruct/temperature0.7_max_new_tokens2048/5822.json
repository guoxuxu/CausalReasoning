  "Explanation": "The health status 'Moderate' combined with a high diet quality implies, by intervention in understanding age, that the person must be 30 years or older as both criteria need to be satisfied according to the code logistics. This reverses from knowing the effects (health status, high diet quality) to deducing the cause (age).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "age ≥ 30 → diet_quality > 7; diet_quality > 7 → health_status = 'Moderate'",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If a person's diet quality is high and their health status is moderate, then they are aged 30 or above, as high diet quality only leads to a moderate health status when the person is 30 or older."
