  "Explanation": "The display showing 'High humidity' can result from conditions other than summer alone. During winter, if it is rainy, the humidity level could reach exactly 80, which is the threshold for 'High humidity'. Although this case precisely meets the cusp, there could be other unconsidered conditions (like an incorrectly adjusted threshold or external interventions) influencing this. The code presumes 'High humidity' at levels strictly over 80, which winter barely achieves, but we can't rule it out entirely without more information or code constraints.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The season and whether it is rainy directly determine the humidity level, which then determines whether high or normal humidity is displayed."
