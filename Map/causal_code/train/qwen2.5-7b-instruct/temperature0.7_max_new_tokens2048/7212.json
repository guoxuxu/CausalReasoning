  "Explanation": "If getWeatherStatus returns 'Pleasant', it indicates that isRainy is false and the temperature is less than 25 degrees. This could indeed be due to updateWeather being called with isRainy set to false along with an appropriate temperature setting. This tests the ability to understand backward causal inference (from effect to cause) based on interventions (explicit changes made by calling updateWeather).",
