  "Explanation": "The alarm system is programmed to trigger an alarm if the window is open, even in the absence of motion. This follows directly from the code in the elif block that checks if the window is open.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
