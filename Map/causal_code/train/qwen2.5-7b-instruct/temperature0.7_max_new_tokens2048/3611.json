  "Explanation": "In the logic of determine_weather_status, a 'Hot and Humid' status is explicitly returned only when the temperature is greater than 30 degrees Celsius. Since this is the only condition under which 'Hot and Humid' is returned, observing this effect implies that the cause (temperature above 30) was present.",
