  "Explanation": "The observed number of competitors nearby influences the base_sales directly as per the conditions in the code ('if competitors_nearby > 3: base_sales = 200, else: base_sales = 300'). Decreasing competitors from 4 to 2 drops the condition from the first branch of the if-else to the second branch, raising the base_sales from 200 to 300. This increase in base_sales leads to an increase in predicted sales.",
