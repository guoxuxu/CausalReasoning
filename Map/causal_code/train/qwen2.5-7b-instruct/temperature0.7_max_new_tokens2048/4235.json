  "Explanation": "Although the heart rate is elevated during exercise as suggested by setting it to at least 100 in the code when isExercising is true, a high heart rate can also be due to other factors like stress, illness, or external stimulants. The code also allows for high heart rates to be set independently of the exercise state.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
