  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'price' in data:\n        data['discount'] = data['price'] * 0.90\n    data['final_amount'] = data['discount'] * 1.15\n    return data\",\n\nIf the price increases, will the final amount naturally increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the original code, an increase in the price directly increases the discount (as the discount is 90% of the price). Subsequently, the final_amount, which is the discount increased by 15%, also increases. Thus, an increase in price naturally leads to an increase in the final amount without any external intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
