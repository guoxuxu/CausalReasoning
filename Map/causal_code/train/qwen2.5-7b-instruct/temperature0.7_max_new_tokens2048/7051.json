  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(cart_items, promo_code): \n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in cart_items) \n    discount = 0 \n    if promo_code == 'SAVE10': \n        discount = total * 0.10 \n    elif promo_code == 'SAVE20': \n        discount = total * 0.20 \n    net_price = total - discount \n    return net_price\",\n\nIf you apply a 10% discount irrespective of the 'promo_code', will there be a change in 'net_price'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting a direct intervention by applying a 10% discount alters the calculation of 'discount', thereby directly affecting 'net_price', regardless of the previous state or value of the 'promo_code'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
