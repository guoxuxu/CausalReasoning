  "Problem": "def calculate_health(exp, diet_quality, age): \n    fitness = (exp * 0.8) + (diet_quality * 0.2)\n    if age > 50:\n        health = fitness - (age * 0.1)\n    else:\n        health = fitness\n    return health\",\n\nAssuming we observe an increase in 'health' after reducing someone's age in the system, can we conclude that the person’s 'exp' or 'diet_quality' was necessarily altered?",
  "Explanation": "Reducing age, especially if the initial age was over 50, directly decreases the age-related penalty on health. This results in an increase in 'health' without necessarily changing 'exp' or 'diet_quality'. The increase is a direct consequence of a lower age penalty rather than changes in other health factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
