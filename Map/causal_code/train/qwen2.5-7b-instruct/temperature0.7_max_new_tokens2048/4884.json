  "Explanation": "Although smoking increases the health risk by 2, a high health risk can also be achieved through other factors, such as age over 50 or low exercise level. Therefore, a high health risk does not necessarily imply that the person is a smoker.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
