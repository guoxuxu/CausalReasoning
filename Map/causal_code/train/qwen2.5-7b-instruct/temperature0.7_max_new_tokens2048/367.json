  "Explanation": "When humidity is set above 0.7 and temperature is set at or below 20, the resulting condition based on the method `determine_conditions` would be 'Rainy'. Thus, changing values as stated changes the weather condition to 'Rainy'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
