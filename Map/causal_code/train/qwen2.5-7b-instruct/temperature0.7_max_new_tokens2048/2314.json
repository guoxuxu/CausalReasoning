  "Explanation": "An increase in the sales record for an item (like bananas) indicates that the 'sell_item' method was successfully executed with that item. 'restock_item' increases inventory and does not influence sales records directly, hence an increment in sales records would not suggest that the 'restock_item' method was called.",
