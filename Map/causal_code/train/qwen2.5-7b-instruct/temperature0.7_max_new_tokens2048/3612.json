  "Explanation": "With an intervention where you manually set the humidity to 40 and knowing the temperature is 35 (an input to the scenario), the weather status determination will always occur under these fixed conditions. Given these exact values fall under the condition for 'Hot and Dry' within the determine_weather_status method, the weather status will be consistently 'Hot and Dry'.",
