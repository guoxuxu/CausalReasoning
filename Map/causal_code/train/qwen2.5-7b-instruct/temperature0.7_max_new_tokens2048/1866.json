  "Explanation": "A lower 'average_age' might suggest problems in how 'age' data is being processed or cleaned in 'clean_data' such as incorrect filling of missing values or data type errors. The function directly manipulates 'age' data which directly affects the 'average_age' calculated in 'analyze_data'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the 'clean_data' function fills missing 'age' values with the mean of 'age', and does not alter the 'average_age' calculation in 'analyze_data', then a lower than expected 'average_age' output from 'analyze_data' could be due to issues within the 'clean_data' function, such as incorrect mean calculation or handling of missing values."
