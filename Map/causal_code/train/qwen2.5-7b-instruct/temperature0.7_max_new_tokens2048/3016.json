  "Explanation": "Temperature changes are dictated by the structure of the current season within the initializeWeather function, not by the status of rainfall. Changing isRaining to true externally in season 3 does not impact the temperature set by the season.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The season directly influences both temperature and isRaining. Changing isRaining to true in season 3 does not necessarily cause an increase in temperature, as temperature is determined solely by the season in this context."
