  "Explanation": "Increasing the `green_light_duration` increases the sum of the green and yellow durations, which, unless offset by a comparable reduction in the `yellow_light_duration`, increases the `red_light_duration` as calculated by `max(30, green_light_duration + yellow_light_duration - 10)`.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
