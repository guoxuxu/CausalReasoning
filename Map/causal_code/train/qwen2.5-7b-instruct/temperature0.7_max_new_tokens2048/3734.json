  "Explanation": "In the code, whether a promotion is active or not, increasing the quantity always leads to an increase in sales since `sales += quantity` in the non-promotional branch, and `sales += 1.2 * quantity` in the promotional branch. Thus, more quantity directly leads to more sales.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the quantity of items sold increases sales, unless a promotion is active. In the absence of a promotion, increasing the quantity further above a threshold decreases sales by 5. When a promotion is active, increasing the quantity increases sales more significantly by 1.2 times the quantity, but still decreases sales by a percentage discount if the quantity exceeds a threshold."
