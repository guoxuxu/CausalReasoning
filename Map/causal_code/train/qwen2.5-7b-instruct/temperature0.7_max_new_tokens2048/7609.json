  "Explanation": "In the 'applyDiscount' method, if 'hasDiscount' is true, the 'basePrice' is decreased by the 'discountRate'. This is a direct causal relationship without any intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
