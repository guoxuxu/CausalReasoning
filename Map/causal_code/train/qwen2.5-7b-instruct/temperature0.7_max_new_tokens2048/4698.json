  "Explanation": "According to the 'update_sales' function, the only scenario under which the sales value increases is when the 'percentage_increase' is positive. Thus, observing an increase in the 'apple' value in 'updated_records' post invocation of 'update_sales' indeed confirms that the 'percentage_increase' was greater than zero.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
