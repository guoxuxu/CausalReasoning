  "Explanation": "An increase in current temperature indeed occurs when the heatOn flag is true and heat is applied, increasing the temperature by 5. However, currentTemp can also increase because it was previously decreased by a large external temperature (over 100) and is now increasing less quickly (3 units decrease halted and plus 5 instead). Therefore, an increase in current temperature does not necessarily mean the external temperature was below 0.",
