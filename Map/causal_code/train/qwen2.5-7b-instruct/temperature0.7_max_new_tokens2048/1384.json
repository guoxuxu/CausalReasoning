  "Explanation": "A high total cost does not necessarily imply a large number of items due to the discount effect. A smaller number of high-priced items, especially if below the discount threshold, can also result in a high total cost.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If a large number of items are ordered (total_items > 50), then a discount is applied (discount = 0.1) which can reduce the total_cost. Therefore, if the total_cost is very high, it implies that a large number of items have not been ordered."
