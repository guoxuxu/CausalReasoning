  "Explanation": "Fixing the 'random_factor' to a constant value removes its influence on the outcome variable ('new_sales'). Under these conditions, any increase in the marketing budget will lead to a predictable and consistent increase in sales, since the relationship between marketing budget and sales is linear and direct in the code, as defined by the equation 'new_sales = current_sales + marketing_budget * 0.3 + random_factor'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the marketing budget directly leads to higher sales, but the effect is influenced by a random factor. The outcome (whether sales exceed 250k) depends on both the marketing budget and the random factor."
