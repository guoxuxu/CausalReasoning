  "Explanation": "Introducing an intervention where health is reset to 100 if it falls below 20 does not affect the causal path from the effect parameter to updating the status. So if the effect is 'poison', the player's status would still be updated to 'poisoned', irrespective of the health intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "When delta decreases player['health'], and if effect is 'poison', player['status'] becomes 'poisoned'. If player['health'] falls below 20, it resets to 100, but this does not change the 'poisoned' status."
