  "Problem": "class Thermostat {\n    private int temperature;\n    private boolean power;\n    \n    public Thermostat() {\n        this.temperature = 70; // Default temperature\n        this.power = false; // Thermostat is initially off\n    }\n\n    public void setTemperature(int temp) {\n        if (this.power && temp >= 60 && temp <= 80) {\n            this.temperature = temp;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void togglePower() {\n        this.power = !this.power;\n        if (!this.power) {\n            this.temperature = 70; // Reset to default when powered off\n        }\n    }\n\n    public int getTemperature() {\n        return this.temperature;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isPowerOn() {\n        return this.power;\n    }\n}\",\n\nIf the temperature is observed to increase, can we infer that someone externally increased the temperature via setTemperature after turning on the power?",
  "Explanation": "The thermostat only allows temperature modification when the power is on, and the temperature is within the range of 60 to 80. Thus, an observed increase must result from someone setting it, assuming no other external factors affecting the device's operation.",
