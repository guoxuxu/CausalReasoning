  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, tax_rate, discount, quantity):\n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate\n    discount_amount = price * discount\n    final_price = (price + tax_amount - discount_amount) * quantity\n    return final_price\n\nsales = calculate_sales(100, 0.07, 0.05, 50)\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in final sales value after setting the quantity to 100, was this necessarily because of the increased quantity?",
  "Explanation": "Given all other factors are constant, doubling the quantity of items sold at the same final_price per unit directly doubles the final sales value, thus the increase is necessarily because of the increased quantity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the quantity directly increases the final price, while changes in price, tax rate, or discount also directly influence the final price."
