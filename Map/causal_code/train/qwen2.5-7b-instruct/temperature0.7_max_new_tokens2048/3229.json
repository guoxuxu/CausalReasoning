  "Problem": "class TrafficSystem { constructor() { this.signal = 'red'; this.cars = 0; } changeSignal(newSignal) { this.signal = newSignal; } updateCars(count) { this.cars += count; } canDrive() { return this.signal === 'green'; } } const cityTraffic = new TrafficSystem(); cityTraffic.changeSignal('green'); cityTraffic.updateCars(5); const isDrivingPossible = cityTraffic.canDrive();\",\n\nIf after an intervention of increasing car count, more cars are seen moving, can it be concluded the signal was definitely green before the intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing car count alone doesn't necessarily imply the traffic signal was green before the intervention. Since this action doesn't directly affect the signal's state, other factors could allow movement (like a change in traffic signal just before the increase in cars). Thus, the signal color prior to the intervention isn't definitively concluded just by more cars moving post-intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
