  "Explanation": "An increase in predicted_sales can occur if either ad_spend crosses the threshold of 50000 or if growth increases to at least 2.0, without necessarily both conditions being met together.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Economic growth also directly influences the sales multiplier, which then affects predicted sales. Predicted sales are directly influenced by both ad expenditure and the sales multiplier."
