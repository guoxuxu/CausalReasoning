  "Explanation": "Merely setting the total_balance to a higher value does not specify how the changes were distributed among account_balance, interest_rate, or bonus adjustments. This ambiguity prevents specific inferences about account_balance or bonus changes based purely on the observed increase in total_balance. This illustrates the challenge of backward causal inference with intervention.",
