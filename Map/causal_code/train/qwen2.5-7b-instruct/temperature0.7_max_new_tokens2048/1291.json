  "Explanation": "Increasing temperature can potentially increase the score depending on the current mood. If the mood is 'happy', scores do not change with temperature increases above 20 degrees. However, if it's 'sad', increasing the temperature from below to above 20 degrees increases the score from 60 to 70.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Temperature above 20 degrees and a happy mood lead to a higher score, while below 20 degrees with a happy mood results in a lower score. Rainy weather makes the mood sad, which correlates with a lower score."
