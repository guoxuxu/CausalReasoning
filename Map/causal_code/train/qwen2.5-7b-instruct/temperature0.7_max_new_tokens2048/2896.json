  "Problem": "def analyze_data(data):\n    height = data['height']\n    age = data['age']\n    weight = age * 2 + 10\n    if height > 170:\n        fitness = 'high'\n    else:\n        fitness = 'low'\n    return {'weight': weight, 'fitness': fitness}\",\n\nIf we manually adjust the age in the data to be higher, will this intervention ensure a 'high' fitness level?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the age affects weight but does not affect height. Since fitness level is determined by height (greater than 170), changing the age does not influence the fitness level directly.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing age leads to an increase in weight, which may lead to a high fitness level if height is above 170; however, height directly influences fitness independently of age."
