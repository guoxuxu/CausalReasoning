  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'final_prices' could be due to a reduction in 'after_discount' values which can be caused by changes in either membership status, original prices, or coupon application mechanism. An increase in 'coupon_value' does not directly result in a general decrease of 'final_prices'; it could rather increase discounts on specific price items only if those items are above the coupon value.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
