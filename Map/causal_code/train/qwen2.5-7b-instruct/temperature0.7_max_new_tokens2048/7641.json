  "Explanation": "Without adjusting the humidity, merely increasing the temperature doesn't directly increase the rain probability, especially if the initial humidity is lower than 60. Rain probability significantly depends on both factors exceeding certain thresholds.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in temperature above 25 leads to an increase in humidity, which can raise rain probability to 80 if humidity is also above 80 and temperature is above 15. If temperature is below 10, it decreases humidity, potentially lowering rain probability to 20 if humidity drops below 60. Otherwise, rain probability is between 20 and 50 based on humidity levels."
