  "Explanation": "Setting the `engineOn` flag to true inside the `accelerate` method would not be effective since the method's condition itself checks whether the engine was on before accelerating. If `engineOn` was initially false when `accelerate` was called, turning it on within the method would not revisit the previously evaluated condition, so the speed would still remain unchanged.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
