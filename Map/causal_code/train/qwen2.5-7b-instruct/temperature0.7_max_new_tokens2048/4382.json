  "Explanation": "If the power state is manually set to 'ON', it doesn't necessarily reflect the adequacy of temperature adjustments (increase or decrease). The intervention to manually set the power state bypasses the normal regulatory mechanism of threshold comparison, thus does not necessarily correlate with the temperatures reached or the adjustments made.",
