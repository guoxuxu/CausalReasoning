  "Explanation": "Applying the applyColdFront() method only lowers the temperature. If willItRain() returns true afterwards, it means both conditions for raining (isCloudy and temperature below 20) are met. However, the method doesn't affect cloudiness, so cloudiness must have been present initially. We cannot infer any change in isCloudy based on temperature modification alone.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Temperature and cloudiness both directly influence whether it will rain. Applying a cold front can change the temperature, which in turn affects the likelihood of rain, but does not directly cause changes in cloudiness."
