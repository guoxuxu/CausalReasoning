  "Explanation": "Changing the 'status' manually to 'minor' suggests that 'is_adult' should logically align with this new status for consistency. Although 'is_adult' is initially derived from 'age', this manual change in 'status' implies that 'is_adult' would have been correspondingly set to False to reflect the new 'status'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If a user's age is 18 or older, then their is_adult flag is True, which sets their status to 'adult'. Conversely, if their is_adult flag is False, their status is set to 'minor'. Changing the status to 'minor' implies that the is_adult flag is False."
