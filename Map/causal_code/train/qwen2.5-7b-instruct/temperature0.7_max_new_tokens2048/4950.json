  "Explanation": "Lower than expected forecasted_sales can result from either reduced current_sales or reduced advertising_budget or both. Therefore, without additional information on advertising_budget, one cannot conclusively state that a dip in forecasted_sales is solely due to a reduction in current_sales.",
