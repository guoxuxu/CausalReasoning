  "Explanation": "The code designates the warning_level as 'undetermined' only if either max_temp or avg_humidity is None, which, according to the code, occurs if the respective data entries ('temperature' or 'humidity') are missing from the input. This conclusion is based on understanding the code logic from the output (effect) back to the conditional checks (causes).",
