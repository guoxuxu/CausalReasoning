  "Explanation": "While the `adjust_temperature` function indeed sets the temperature to 85 when the setting is 'High', by intervening directly on the `temperature` and setting it to 85, we cannot deduce the link back to the original `thermostat_setting`, as the temperature could have been altered through other means or direct intervention.",
