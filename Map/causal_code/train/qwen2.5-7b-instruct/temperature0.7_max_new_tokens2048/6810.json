  "Explanation": "Changing the 'membership_status' from 'none' to 'gold' reduces each item's price due to higher discount rates applied in the 'calculate_discount' function, which cumulatively reduces the 'total_cost'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
