  "Explanation": "Manually increasing the temperature simulates the effect of the heater being on and tests if the 'increase_temperature' function correctly adds the specified degree or if further adjustments (like environmental influences) are needed in the function.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
