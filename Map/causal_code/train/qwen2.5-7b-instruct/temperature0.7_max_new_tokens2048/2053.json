  "Explanation": "Changing the membership status from True to False decreases the discount rate from 0.1 to 0.05, leading to higher prices after discount calculation, thus 'after_discount' values will not increase but rather decrease.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
