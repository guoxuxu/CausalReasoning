  "Explanation": "From the code, the virus spread rate directly multiples the confirmed cases by 1.5 or 2 depending on the temperature. Increasing the confirmed cases will thus directly lead to a higher virus spread rate, indicating a causal effect of confirmed cases on virus spread rate when intervened.",
