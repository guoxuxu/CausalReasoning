  "Explanation": "A decrease in revenue can occur due to either a decrease in `numberOfSales` or a decrease in `pricePerUnit`. Without specific information about the change in `pricePerUnit`, one cannot conclusively state that `numberOfSales` has decreased.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
