  "Problem": "def update_inventory(item_sales, inventory_counts):\n    for item, sold in item_sales.items():\n        if item in inventory_counts:\n            inventory_counts[item] -= sold\n    return inventory_counts\",\n\nIf the method were modified to only decrease the inventory when sales exceed 10 units of an item, would fewer items generally remain in the inventory for high-sales items?",
  "Explanation": "With this intervention, only items with sales exceeding 10 units will reduce the inventory, potentially leaving more items in inventory for high-sales items than if every sale was counted. This depends on how frequently sales exceed 10 units for high-sales items.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
