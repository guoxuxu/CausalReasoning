  "Problem": "def compute_effects(treatment, age, diet): \n    health = 0.5 * treatment + 0.3 * age - 0.2 * diet \n    energy_level = 0.3 * treatment + 0.4 * age + 0.5 * diet \n    stress_level = -0.3 * treatment + 0.5 * diet \n    return health, energy_level, stress_level\",\n\nIf an intervention sets 'diet' to 0, will the 'energy_level' be influenced only by 'treatment' and 'age'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'diet' to 0 effectively removes the diet's contribution (0.5 * diet) to 'energy_level'. As a result, 'energy_level' becomes dependent solely on the values of 'treatment' and 'age'. The code suggests a direct linear dependence on these two variables.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
