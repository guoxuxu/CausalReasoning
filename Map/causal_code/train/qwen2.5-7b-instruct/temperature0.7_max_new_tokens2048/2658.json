  "Explanation": "While 'error' in the data dictionary initially sets the status to 'FAIL', the presence of the 'retry' key with a value of True can change the status from 'FAIL' to 'RETRY'. Therefore, the final status might not always be 'FAIL'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of 'error' in the data dictionary leads to 'status' being set to 'FAIL'. If 'retry' is True and 'status' is 'FAIL', then 'status' is set to 'RETRY'. The presence of 'error' can also indirectly lead to 'status' becoming 'RETRY'."
