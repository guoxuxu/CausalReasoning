  "Explanation": "According to the code, sales increase linearly with visits either by `newVisits` or `newVisits * 2` depending on whether a promotion is active or not. However, no intervention (like activating promotions) is considered in this scenario, thus the direct influence of visits on sales stands.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
