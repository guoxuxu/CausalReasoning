  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, volume, tax_rate): \n    tax_amount = price * volume * tax_rate \n    total_sales = (price * volume) + tax_amount \n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf a government policy sets a minimum price, will total_sales increase?",
  "Explanation": "Setting a minimum price (an intervention) likely increases the base price if the minimum is higher than the current price. According to the function, total_sales depends positively on price. Therefore, this policy intervention would indirectly increase total_sales by increasing the base price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "A minimum price set by government policy can increase tax_amount and total_sales through its direct impact on price, which in turn affects tax_amount and total_sales."
