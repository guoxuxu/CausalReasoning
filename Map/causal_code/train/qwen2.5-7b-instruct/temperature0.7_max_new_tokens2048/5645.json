  "Explanation": "The 'take_medicine' method directly checks if 'is_sick' is True and then lowers the temperature. If the final temperature drops to or below 98.6, 'is_sick' is reset to False. This describes an intervention (medicine) leading to a change in sickness status.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When a patient takes medicine, their temperature decreases by 2 degrees unless it falls below 98.6, after which they are no longer considered sick. Therefore, taking medicine can result in 'is_sick' being set to False, but this is not guaranteed if the temperature is already at or below 98.6."
