  "Explanation": "In the TrafficSimulation class, the manage_traffic method uses the value of green_light_duration to determine when the light should switch from green to red when the current state is green. Therefore, increasing this duration extends the time period the light stays green before switching to red automatically.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
