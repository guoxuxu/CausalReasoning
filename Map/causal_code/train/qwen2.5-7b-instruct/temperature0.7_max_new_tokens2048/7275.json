  "Explanation": "The decideToUseUmbrella() method sets useUmbrella to true when it is raining and the temperature is below 25. By setting isRaining to true and ensuring the temperature is below 25 through intervention, useUmbrella will likely be set to true.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
