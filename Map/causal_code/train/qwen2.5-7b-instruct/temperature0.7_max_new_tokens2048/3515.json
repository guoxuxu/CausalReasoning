  "Explanation": "While the temperature greater than 30 does cause a reduction in humidity, low humidity alone cannot definitively indicate high temperatures because humidity also has a broad random range (20 to 90) independently of temperature effects. Low humidity could occur with low or moderate temperatures as well.",
