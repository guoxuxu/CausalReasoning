  "Explanation": "The observed volume of 30 could be achieved by methods other than just increaseVolume, such as setting the volume directly using setVolume. Hence, a status showing 30 doesn’t directly imply that increaseVolume was the last method invoked.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The increaseVolume method increases the volume, which then affects the status message. The setVolume method sets the volume, also influencing the status message. Therefore, if the status shows a volume of 30, it implies that either the increaseVolume method was called with a starting volume less than 30 or the setVolume method was used to set the volume to exactly 30."
