  "Explanation": "By activating the sensor using 'activate()', the sensor begins to detect and count movements. If sufficient movements (more than five) are detected, the alarm is triggered. The activation directly allows the sensor to record movements and eventually trigger the alarm if the threshold is exceeded.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When 'activate' is called, 'isActive' becomes true. Each call to 'detectMovement' increases 'detectedMovements'. If 'isActive' is true and 'detectedMovements' exceeds 5, 'isAlarmTriggered' returns true, indicating the alarm will be triggered."
