  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  int temperature;\n  boolean isRaining;\n\n  WeatherSimulator(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.isRaining = false;\n  }\n\n  void updateWeather() {\n    if (this.temperature < 10) {\n      this.isRaining = true;\n    } else {\n      this.isRaining = false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  void increaseTemperature(int increment) {\n    this.temperature += increment;\n    updateWeather();\n  }\n\n  void decreaseTemperature(int decrement) {\n    this.temperature -= decrement;\n    updateWeather();\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf you manually increase the temperature, will it stop raining?",
  "Explanation": "Using the increaseTemperature method triggers an increase in temperature and subsequently calls updateWeather. If the temperature rises above 10, updateWeather will set isRaining to false. Thus, any manual increase leading to a temperature above 10 degrees will stop the rain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
