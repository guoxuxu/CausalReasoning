  "Problem": "def calculate_score(temperature, humidity):\n    if temperature > 20:\n        comfort = 'High'\n    else:\n        comfort = 'Low'\n    if humidity > 50:\n        feeling = 'Sticky'\n    else:\n        feeling = 'Comfortable'\n    if comfort == 'High' and feeling == 'Comfortable':\n        return 'Enjoyable Day'\n    else:\n        return 'Not Ideal Day'\n\nprint(calculate_score(25, 45))\",\n\nIf we observe the output 'Enjoyable Day' and then set humidity to above 50%, will the temperature necessarily be above 20?",
  "Explanation": "For the output to initially be 'Enjoyable Day', both 'comfort' must be 'High' and 'feeling' must be 'Comfortable'. 'Comfort' being 'High' necessarily means the temperature was above 20. Setting the humidity above 50% only affects the 'feeling' but doesn't change this past condition on the temperature.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
