  "Explanation": "Adding fertilizer through the add_fertilizer method increases the fertilizer property in the environment, which in turn boosts the health by 10 for each unit of fertilizer (adjusted for the amount). This effect operates cumulatively with other favorable environmental factors.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
