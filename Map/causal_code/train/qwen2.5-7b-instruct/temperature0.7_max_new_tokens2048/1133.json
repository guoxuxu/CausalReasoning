  "Explanation": "Traffic levels above 100 only occur if the weather status is 1 (rainy), where the traffic level calculation starts from 100 and adds a random value up to 50. Hence, a reading above 100 strongly suggests it rained.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
