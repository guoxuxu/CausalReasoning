  "Explanation": "According to the code, a promotional event adds an extra 50 visitors. Therefore, a promotional event cannot cause a drop in visitor numbers; it only increases them.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
