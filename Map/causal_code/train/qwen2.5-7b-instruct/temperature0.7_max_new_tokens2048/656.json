  "Explanation": "Higher values in 'data' would increase the sum of the list, thus raising the average calculated by summing the temperatures and dividing by the number of days. This is a direct causal relationship from cause (data values) to effect (average temperature) without intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
