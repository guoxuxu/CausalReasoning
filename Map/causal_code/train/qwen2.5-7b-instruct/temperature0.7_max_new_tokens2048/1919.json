  "Explanation": "The 'vaccinate' method describes a reduction in patient count especially during flu season by a factor influenced by the percentage of patients vaccinated. Thus, vaccinating 30% of patients during flu season specifically leads to a reduction in the patient count due to a 30% vaccination factor reducing flu-related admissions.",
