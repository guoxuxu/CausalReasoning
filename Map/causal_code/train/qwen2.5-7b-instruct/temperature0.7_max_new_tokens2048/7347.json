  "Explanation": "From the output being False, we know that 'result' is 50 or below, but this alone does not provide exact values for 'original' or 'factor' without additional information. Multiple combinations of 'original' and 'factor' could lead to such output.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
