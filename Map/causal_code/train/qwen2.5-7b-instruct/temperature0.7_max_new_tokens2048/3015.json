  "Explanation": "Rain does not uniquely determine the season as 2, since raining also occurs in season 4 within the initializeWeather logic, showing ambiguity in season identification solely based on rain.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The fact that it is raining does not necessarily mean the season was set to 2. The weather simulator sets the `isRaining` variable based on the `season`, but knowing `isRaining` true only indicates that the season could be either 2 or 4."
