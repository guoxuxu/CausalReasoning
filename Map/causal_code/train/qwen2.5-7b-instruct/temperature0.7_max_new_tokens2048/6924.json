  "Explanation": "Pre-processing to remove negatives will not affect the 'mean_value', because the 'clean_data' method within the DataProcessor class inherently performs this action. Hence, the preprocessing step outside the class doesn't change resulting 'mean_value' since it duplicates the internal cleaning logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "By removing all negative values from 'data' before initializing the DataProcessor instance, the 'cleaned_data' will contain only non-negative values, which will result in a potentially higher 'mean_value' because the mean is calculated based on a smaller set of values that are generally larger than the original set including negatives."
