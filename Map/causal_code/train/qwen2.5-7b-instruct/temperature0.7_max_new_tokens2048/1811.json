  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 22 degrees would set the stress level to 'medium' according to the `stress_level` function. If the air quality remains moderate (index between 80 and 150), this would lead to a medium productivity rating, which is an improvement if the air quality or previous stress level would otherwise have resulted in low productivity",
