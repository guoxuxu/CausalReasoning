  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"This Python script calculates and displays the revenue, expenses, and net income for a company. The net income depends on both the revenue and expenses.\",\n    \"code\": \"def calculate_net_income(revenue, expenses):\n    net_income = revenue - expenses\n    if net_income > 0:\n        print(f'Profit: ${net_income}')\n    else:\n        print(f'Loss: ${net_income}')\nrevenue = 1000\nexpenses = 500\ncalculate_net_income(revenue, expenses)\"\n  },\n\nIf an accounting error is discovered that previously overestimated net income, does this mean expenses were underestimated?",
  "Explanation": "Assuming the revenue estimate was correct, any overestimation of net income due to an accounting error would imply that the actual expenses were higher than initially calculated or recorded, hence 'underestimated'. Correcting this would adjust the expenses figure upwards.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
