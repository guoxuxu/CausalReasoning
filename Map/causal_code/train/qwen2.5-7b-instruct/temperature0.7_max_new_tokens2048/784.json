  "Problem": "class WeatherController {\n  int temperature;\n  boolean isRaining;\n\n  WeatherController(int temp, boolean rain) {\n    this.temperature = temp;\n    this.isRaining = rain;\n  }\n\n  String getWeatherStatus() {\n    if (temperature > 20 && !isRaining) {\n      return \"Sunny\";\n    } else if (temperature <= 20 && isRaining) {\n      return \"Rainy\";\n    }\n    return \"Cloudy\";\n  }\n\n  void temperatureRise(int increase) {\n    this.temperature += increase;\n    if (this.temperature > 30) {\n      this.isRaining = false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  void simulateRain() {\n    this.isRaining = true;\n    if (this.temperature > 20) {\n      this.temperature -= 5;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the temperature rises above 30 degrees, could it lead to the weather status being Sunny?",
  "Explanation": "Calling the `temperatureRise` function with an increase that results in a temperature above 30 will set `isRaining` to false. With high temperature and no rain, according to the `getWeatherStatus` method, the weather status will be 'Sunny'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature rises above 30 degrees, it will lead to the weather status being Cloudy because the increased temperature causes isRaining to become false, which in turn causes getWeatherStatus to return 'Cloudy'."
