  "Explanation": "Disabling error checking won’t affect the conditions under which the machine 'proceeds'. For high-priority printing jobs, removing error checking would not override the necessity to have no errors for proceeding. It would actually result in incorrect handling of real error conditions and potentially larger failures.",
