  "Explanation": "A low result could occur under either condition. With the 'filter' flag, if all data points are non-positive, the sum would be zero. With the 'no_filter' flag, low or negative values in the data can also produce a low result after halving the sum. Hence, low result alone does not imply which flag was used.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The 'flag' setting influences the 'result' through the creation of 'filtered_data'. If 'flag' is 'filter', 'filtered_data' will contain only positive values, potentially leading to a lower 'result' compared to when 'flag' is 'no_filter'. Conversely, 'no_filter' includes all data, which may result in a higher 'result'. Therefore, a low 'result' can imply that 'flag' was set to 'filter', but this is not definitive without considering the actual content of 'data'."
