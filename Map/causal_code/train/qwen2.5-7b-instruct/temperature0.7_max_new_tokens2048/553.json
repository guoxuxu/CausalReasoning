  "Problem": "def compute_health_scores(age, weight, exercise_hours):\n    health_risk = (age * 0.2 + weight * 0.5) - exercise_hours * 2\n    if health_risk > 50:\n        return 'High Risk'\n    elif 20 <= health_risk <= 50:\n        return 'Medium Risk'\n    else:\n        return 'Low Risk'\",\n\nIf the age and weight of a person increases, will the health risk category 'High Risk' likely result more often without any changes to exercise hours?",
  "Explanation": "Since age and weight contribute positively to the health_risk score, and exercise hours are not changed to offset these effects, increasing age and weight increase the health_risk score, leading to a more probable 'High Risk' categorization.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
