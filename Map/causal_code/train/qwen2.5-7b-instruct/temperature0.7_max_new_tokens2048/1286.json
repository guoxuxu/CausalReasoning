  "Explanation": "Setting productivity to 'high' does not provide information on the original mood state. Productivity could be set to 'high' externally even if the mood was not initially 'happy'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature is greater than 20, then the mood is happy, which leads to high productivity; if the temperature is less than or equal to 25, the mood is sad or productivity is low. Setting productivity to high does not necessarily mean the mood was happy."
