  "Explanation": "Setting the initial temperature to 17 degrees starts with cloudy weather (as 17 is less than 20). Upon lowering the temperature to 11 degrees, which is below 15, the already cloudy weather turns into rainy weather as per the code logic.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
