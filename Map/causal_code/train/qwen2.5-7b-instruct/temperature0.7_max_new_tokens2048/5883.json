  "Problem": "{\n    \"PythonCode\": [\n      \"def calculate_costs(quantity, base_cost, transport_cost):\",\n      \"    total_cost = (quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost\",\n      \"    if quantity > 50:\",\n      \"        discount = 0.1 # 10% discount\",\n      \"        total_cost = total_cost - (total_cost * discount)\",\n      \"    return total_cost\"\n    ]\n  },\n\nIf 'quantity' increases, will 'total_cost' necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "Although increasing quantity normally raises costs due to higher base costs, surpassing a quantity of 50 triggers a discount, potentially lowering or stabilizing the total cost despite higher quantities.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
