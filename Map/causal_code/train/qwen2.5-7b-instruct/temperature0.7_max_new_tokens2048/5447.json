  "Explanation": "The 'price' field affects the 'discount' (10% of the price). Since 'sales' is calculated as 10 times the 'discount', any change in 'price' will indeed change 'sales'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
