  "Explanation": "Without the deposit method call, the initial balance was 100 and only 150 was attempted to be withdrawn, which would adjust the balance but not to 150. The balance would be -50 assuming the operations could continue, but by the given code, the withdraw operation would not proceed without enough balance, hence the final_balance would not be 150 but remain 100.",
