  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data):\n    average_price = sum(data['price']) / len(data['price'])\n    total_sales = sum(data['quantity'])\n    if average_price > 100:\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0.05\n    final_sales = total_sales * (1 - discount)\n    return final_sales, discount\",\n\nIf `final_sales` grows significantly, can we deduce that `total_sales` grew significantly?",
  "Explanation": "A significant increase in `final_sales` could be attributed to either an increase in `total_sales` or a larger discount reduction if `average_price` falls below 100, thus the impact is not singularly from `total_sales`. We cannot conclusively deduce the behavior of `total_sales` simply from observing `final_sales`.",
