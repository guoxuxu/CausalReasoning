  "Explanation": "Higher item prices lead to an increase in total cost because total cost is computed as the sum of the product of prices and quantities. Although the discount on the higher total will also be larger, the final cost (total payment) still ends up being higher.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
