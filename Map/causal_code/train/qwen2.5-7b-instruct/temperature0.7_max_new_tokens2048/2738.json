  "Explanation": "Increasing the base price directly influences the final price computation in the 'update_final_price' method, where the final price is calculated as the base price adjusted for discount and tax. The increase in base price thus increases the final price proportionally, based on the current discount and tax settings.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
