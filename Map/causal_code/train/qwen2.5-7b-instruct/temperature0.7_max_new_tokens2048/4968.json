  "Explanation": "Although changing 'is_discounted' affects 'discount_rate', the reverse isn't necessarily true. The 'discount_rate' being 0.0 could either mean 'is_discounted' is False, or the price was set to a value over 20 by 'update_price', which resets both 'is_discounted' and 'discount_rate' regardless of the previous state of 'is_discounted'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The value of 'is_discounted' directly influences 'discount_rate'; 'new_price' determines whether 'is_discounted' becomes True or False, which in turn affects 'discount_rate'."
