  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { private double temperature; public WeatherSimulator(double temp) { temperature = temp; } public void adjustTemperature(double delta) { temperature += delta; } public boolean willItRain() { return temperature < 20; } public double getTemperature() { return temperature; } }\",\n\nIf willItRain method returned true, and you know the temperature was initially above 25 degrees, can you deduce that an intervention occurred to reduce the temperature below 20?",
  "Explanation": "If the initial temperature was more than 25 degrees and the observed effect is that willItRain returns true (implying temperature is <20), an intervention (like adjustTemperature with a negative delta) must have occurred to reduce the temperature below the threshold of 20 degrees.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
