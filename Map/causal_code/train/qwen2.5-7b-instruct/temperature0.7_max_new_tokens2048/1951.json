  "Explanation": "An external intervention that increases or decreases the 'age' attribute of items in `data` will directly impact which items are filtered based on the age condition set in `processed_data`. This is an example of an intervention impacting the causal flow from cause (`data`) to effect (`processed_data`).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

The 'income' threshold and 'education' level also directly impact the composition of `processed_data` and the 'status' field."
