  "Explanation": "A higher sum could be due either to 'modify_flag' being True or simply because the 'data' elements and the 'filter_val' allowed higher values to be included in the sum. 'filtered_data' might naturally be large enough to give a higher sum irrespective of whether they are doubled.",

  "causal_map_integration": "A higher filter_val leads to a smaller filtered_data, which in turn results in a potentially smaller transformed_data and sum. A True modify_flag leads to a transformed_data that is twice the original values, potentially resulting in a higher sum."
