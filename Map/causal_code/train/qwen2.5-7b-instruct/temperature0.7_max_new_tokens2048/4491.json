  "Explanation": "Increasing the temperature might trigger rain (if the temperature exceeds 30 degrees) according to the code. When it rains, the humidity is set to 95. Therefore, if the temperature increase leads to raining, then the humidity will increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
