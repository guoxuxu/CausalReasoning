  "Explanation": "While toggling the heater on can cause a 5-degree increase in temperature, the same temperature change could also occur from an increase in the external temperature if neither the AC nor the heater is on. Therefore, a 5-degree increase in system temperature does not necessarily mean the heater was toggled.",
