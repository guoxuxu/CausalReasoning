  "Explanation": "The increase in plant size and consequently in herbivore energy could result from the increased growth rate alone, independent of the weather condition. Therefore, raining is not the sole factor and isn’t conclusively assumed.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Weather's raininess directly influences plant size, which in turn affects herbivore energy. Increased plant growth rate due to weather conditions leads to higher herbivore energy."
