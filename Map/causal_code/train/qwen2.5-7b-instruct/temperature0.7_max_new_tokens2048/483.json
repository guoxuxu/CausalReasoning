  "Explanation": "According to the code, on sunny days when it is not a holiday, traffic is 'light'. Declaring it a holiday would change the traffic to 'moderate' from 'light'. Therefore, declaring a holiday does not make traffic lighter on a sunny day; rather, it makes it moderate.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
