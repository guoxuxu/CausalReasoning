  "Explanation": "The code increases the discount based on the total price exceeding $100 and this is independent of coupon usage. Coupon usage and total price exceeding are independent, thus a high total price doesn't necessarily mean a coupon was used.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The use of 'SAVE10' coupon sets the discount to 0.1, and if the total price exceeds 100, an additional 5% discount is applied."
