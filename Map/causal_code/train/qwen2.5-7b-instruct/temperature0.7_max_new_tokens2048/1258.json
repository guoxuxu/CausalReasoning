  "Explanation": "According to the code, introducing a promotion at a temperature above 20 results in an increase in sales from 20 extra sales (without promotion) to 50 extra sales (with promotion).",

  "causal_map_integration": "When the temperature is above 20 degrees and there is a promotion, sales increase by 50. If there is no promotion but the temperature is above 20 degrees, sales increase by 20. If the temperature is below or equal to 20 degrees but there is a promotion, sales increase by 30. Otherwise, sales remain at 100."
