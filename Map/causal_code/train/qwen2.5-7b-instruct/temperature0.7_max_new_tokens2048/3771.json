  "Problem": "def calculate_health_index(age, diet_quality, exercise_freq):\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health_index = 70\n    else:\n        base_health_index = 90\n    diet_effect = diet_quality * 0.5\n    exercise_effect = exercise_freq * 1.2\n    health_index = base_health_index + diet_effect + exercise_effect\n    return health_index\",\n\nIf the calculated health_index is found to be lower than expected, can we conclude that the individual is older than 50?",
  "Explanation": "The lower health_index could also result from poor diet_quality or lower exercise_freq. Since multiple factors affect the health_index, the age being over 50 is not the only possible cause.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If age is greater than 50, then the base health index is set to 70; diet quality influences the diet effect; exercise frequency influences the exercise effect; the base health index, diet effect, and exercise effect collectively determine the health index."
