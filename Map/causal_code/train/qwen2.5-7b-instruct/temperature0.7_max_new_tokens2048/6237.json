  "Explanation": "Reducing the heart rate, especially if it was above 100 bpm, places the heart rate back within a healthier range (ideally between 60-100 bpm), which, alongside adequate sleep hours, could lower the risk level from 'High' to 'Moderate' or 'Low'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
