  "Explanation": "Since the risk of mold is conditioned on whether humidity exceeds 50, actively controlling and reducing humidity below this threshold will directly reduce the risk of mold.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
