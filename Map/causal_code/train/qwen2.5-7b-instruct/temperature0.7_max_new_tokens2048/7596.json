  "Problem": "def business_logic(revenue, costs, marketing_campaign_active):\n    profit = revenue - costs\n    if marketing_campaign_active:\n        revenue_increase = revenue * 0.2\n        revenue += revenue_increase\n    return profit\n\n# Assume initial conditions\ninitial_revenue = 10000\ninitial_costs = 7000\ncampaign_active = True\n\nresulting_profit = business_logic(initial_revenue, initial_costs, campaign_active)\",\n\nIf the resulting profit is observed to be higher, can we conclude that the marketing campaign was definitely active?",
  "Explanation": "A higher profit could also be due to reasons other than an active marketing campaign, such as a decrease in costs or an independent increase in revenue. Since an active marketing campaign isn't the only avenue to increase revenue, observing a higher profit does not conclusively establish the campaign's activity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
