  "Explanation": "Setting 'total_sales' to less than 100000 removes the bonus of 500 (as set in 'performance_bonus'), directly decreasing the 'total_pay' by 500 if previously 'total_sales' was over 100000, impacting the calculation in 'main'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
