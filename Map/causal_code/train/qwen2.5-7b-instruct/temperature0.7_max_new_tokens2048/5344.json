  "Explanation": "A 'good' mood in the morning indicates no traffic jam and that the person had coffee. However, it does not conclusively indicate that the weather was sunny because, hypothetically, other unaccounted factors (not shown in this simple function) could also lead to no traffic jams even on rainy days.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
