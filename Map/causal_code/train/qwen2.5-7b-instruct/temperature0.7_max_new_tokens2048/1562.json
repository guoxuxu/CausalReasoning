  "Explanation": "Given that changing the discount rate affects the product's ability to be purchased, it implies that the initial `on_sale` flag must have been True. The `discount_rate` impacts the product price only if `on_sale` is True, indicating that originally the product had to be on sale to apply any discount rate change.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "When a product is on sale, it has a higher discount rate, a lower price, and a higher likelihood that a customer with a certain budget can purchase it. The customer's budget directly influences whether they can purchase the product, and the product's price is a key factor in determining this."
