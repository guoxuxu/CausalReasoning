  "Explanation": "The 'output' being 'High' implies the result is greater than the threshold (15). However, this can be achieved either by setting the 'flag' to True and multiplying 'x' by 2 (leading to 10) or by setting 'flag' to False wherein the addition results in a value above the threshold (more than 15 in case where x is sufficiently large), indicating 'flag' being True is not a necessity.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If 'flag' is True, then 'result' is doubled; otherwise, 'result' has 10 added. 'x' determines the initial value of 'result'. If 'result' > 15, then 'output' is 'High'; otherwise, 'output' is 'Low'. Therefore, for 'output' to be 'High', 'result' must be greater than 15, which can occur if 'flag' is True and the doubled value of 'x' exceeds 15, or if 'flag' is False and 'x' plus 10 exceeds 15."
