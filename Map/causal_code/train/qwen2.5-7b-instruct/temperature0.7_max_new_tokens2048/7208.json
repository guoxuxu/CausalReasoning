  "Problem": "def process_order(product_id, quantity):\n    stock = check_stock(product_id)\n    if stock >= quantity:\n        update_stock(product_id, quantity)\n        log_activity(product_id, quantity)\n    else:\n        print('Insufficient stock for product', product_id)\",\n\nIf you see that the log_activity consistently shows 'Insufficient stock' messages, can we conclude that the stock level for that product is zero?",
  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention, seeing 'Insufficient stock' messages only indicates that at the time of each order, stock was less than the order quantity. It does not necessarily mean that stock is zero; stock could be less than what was ordered but not necessarily depleted completely.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "check_stock(product_id) determines the stock level, which, if less than the requested quantity, leads to logging 'Insufficient stock' activity and printing the same message."
