  "Explanation": "While the decrease in the tax rate, by itself, tends to increase total sales by reducing the overall price, an increase in discounts can also contribute to the rise in total_sales. This depends on how the interplay between less tax and higher discounts affects the final taxed prices and the corresponding consumer response.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing discounts can lead to lower prices, which can then result in higher sales when taxes are reduced, as both lower prices and lower taxes contribute to increased total sales."
