  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, base_demand, economy_boost):\n    if discount >= 20:\n        demand_increase = 15\n    elif discount >= 10:\n        demand_increase = 10\n    else:\n        demand_increase = 5\n\n    adjusted_demand = base_demand + demand_increase\n    if economy_boost:\n        adjusted_demand *= 1.1\n\n    revenue = adjusted_demand * (price * (1 - (discount / 100)))\n    return revenue\",\n\nIf we implement a policy to increase 'base_demand' through marketing, will this increase the 'revenue'?",
  "Explanation": "Implementing a policy to increase 'base_demand' directly increases the 'adjusted_demand', assuming other factors such as 'discount' and 'economy_boost' remain constant or neutral. An increase in 'adjusted_demand' directly leads to an increase in 'revenue', given the number of units sold improves.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing base_demand through marketing will increase adjusted_demand, which in turn will increase revenue. Additionally, higher discount, price, and economy_boost conditions will also contribute to higher revenue."
