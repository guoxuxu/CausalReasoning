  "Problem": "def compute_final_score(base_score, bonus, penalty, is_new_user): \n  if is_new_user:\n    bonus *= 2\n  final_score = base_score + bonus - penalty\n  return final_score\",\n\nIf an intervention reduces the 'final_score', can it be assumed this was achieved by marking 'is_new_user' as false?",
  "Explanation": "Reducing the 'final_score' could be achieved by various means such as decreasing the 'base_score', reducing 'bonus', increasing 'penalty', or indeed, by not doubling the bonus (i.e., setting 'is_new_user' to false). However, without knowing exactly how the intervention was applied (and assuming 'bonus' was significant), we cannot definitively attribute the reduction in 'final_score' solely to the 'is_new_user' status. This illustrates the complexity of deciphering specific causal pathways from an effect back to a cause with intervention.",
