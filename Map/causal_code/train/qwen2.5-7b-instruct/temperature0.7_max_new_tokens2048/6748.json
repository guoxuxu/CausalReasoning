  "Explanation": "For individuals above 50, an increase in exercise frequency above 3 times per week will add 10 points to their health index, which was initially at 70. This increment occurs notwithstanding their age.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
