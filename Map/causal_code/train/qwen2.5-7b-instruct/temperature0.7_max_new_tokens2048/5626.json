  "Problem": "def compute_final_price(base_price, tax_rate, discount, has_discount):\n    tax_amount = base_price * tax_rate\n    if has_discount:\n        discount_amount = base_price * discount\n    else:\n        discount_amount = 0\n    final_price = (base_price - discount_amount) + tax_amount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final_price is seen to increase after an intervention, can we infer that the discount was removed or reduced?",
  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: An increase in final_price after an intervention may result from either removing or reducing the discount, but it can also be due to increases in the base_price or tax_rate. Without knowing which parameter was specifically altered, it is impossible to attribute the cause solely to changes in the discounting process.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "has_discount → discount_amount; discount → discount_amount; has_discount → final_price; discount → final_price",
  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence or absence of a discount and its value directly affect the discount_amount, which in turn influences the final_price. Removing or reducing the discount will likely increase the final_price."
