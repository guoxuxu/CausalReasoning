  "Explanation": "Making the weather sunny would ensure the traffic is light, but it is assumed in the modeled environment that light traffic leads to 30 minutes of travel time. However, intervention in the code might not account for other variables like accidents or unexpected blocks not modeled, hence not guaranteeing exactly 30 minutes every time.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
