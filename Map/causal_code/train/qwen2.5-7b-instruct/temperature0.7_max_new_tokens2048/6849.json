  "Explanation": "The eligibility is determined by the health score (healthScore > 50). Assuming the individual was initially ineligible, an intervention that causes a significant increase in health score (such as quitting smoking or hypothetically reversing aging effect) could make them eligible again because these are the two direct factors affecting health score notably.",
