  "Explanation": "Updating the weather system to a 'Desert' type with a temperature over 30 degrees leads directly to a 'Sunny' forecast as per the forecast method, showing a causal effect due to the intervention of setting a specific high temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
