  "Explanation": "While a promotional event could cause an increase in both sales and customers, this increase could also result from other factors, such as a natural increase in store popularity or other marketing efforts not included in the code. Hence, we cannot definitively infer the occurrence of a promotional event based on the observed effects alone without other supporting evidence.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
