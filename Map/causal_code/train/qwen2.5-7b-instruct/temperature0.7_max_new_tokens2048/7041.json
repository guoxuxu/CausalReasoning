  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"A program that calculates the final price of an item after sales discount and then adds tax.\",\n    \"code\": [\n      \"def calculate_discount(price, discount):\",\n      \"    return price * (1 - discount/100)\",\n      \"def apply_tax(price, tax_rate):\",\n      \"    return price * (1 + tax_rate/100)\",\n      \"def final_price(initial_price, discount_rate, tax_rate):\",\n      \"    discounted_price = calculate_discount(initial_price, discount_rate)\",\n      \"    final_amount = apply_tax(discounted_price, tax_rate)\",\n      \"    return final_amount\",\n      \"item_price = 120\",\n      \"discount = 15\",\n      \"tax = 8\",\n      \"result = final_price(item_price, discount, tax)\"\n    ]\n  },\n\nIf the initial price is increased, will the final price increase assuming no changes in discount or tax?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the initial price increases the base amount upon which discounts and taxes are calculated. Since the discount and tax percentages remain the same, the final discounted and taxed price will also increase as it is calculated as a percentage of a larger initial price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
