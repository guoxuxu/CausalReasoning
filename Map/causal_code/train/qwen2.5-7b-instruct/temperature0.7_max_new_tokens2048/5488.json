  "Problem": "def compute_final_score(base_score, bonus, penalty, high_score_bonus_enabled):\n    if base_score > 90 and high_score_bonus_enabled:\n        bonus += 20\n    final_score = base_score + bonus - penalty\n    if final_score > 100:\n        final_score = 100\n    return final_score\",\n\nIf final_score equals 100, can we conclude that high_score_bonus_enabled was True?",
  "Explanation": "Without intervention, reaching a final_score of 100 could be due to a combination of a high base_score and bonus, irrespective of the high_score_bonus. The cap at 100 is applied regardless of how it is achieved, and high_score_bonus_enabled being True is one of several paths to reach 100.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If base_score is greater than 90 and high_score_bonus_enabled is True, bonus increases by 20; final_score is calculated as base_score plus bonus minus penalty, and if final_score exceeds 100, it is capped at 100."
