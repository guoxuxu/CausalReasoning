  "Explanation": "With temperature fixed at 25 degrees by intervention, the automatic reduction of humidity through `increaseTemperature` is not triggered. Thus, any decrease in humidity must be due to manual or external updates, not because of temperature change within the system at this range.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
