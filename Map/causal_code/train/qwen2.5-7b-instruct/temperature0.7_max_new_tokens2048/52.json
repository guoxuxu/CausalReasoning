  "Explanation": "If the temperature is manually set below 30, then, regardless of humidity, the heat index cannot be 'High'. Observing a 'Normal' heat index status after this manual setting strongly suggests that recent conditions (or interventions) ensured the temperature did not increase beyond the threshold, demonstrating causal inference through intervention.",
