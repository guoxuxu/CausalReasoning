  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, customer_age, is_first_time_customer): \n    if customer_age > 60 or is_first_time_customer: \n        discount = 0.10 \n    else: \n        discount = 0.05 \n    final_price = price * (1 - discount) \n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the price of an item is increased, will the final price always increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, when price increases the final price will also increase as the discount rate is constant and only dependent on the customer's age and if they are a first-time customer. The final price is directly proportional to the price (final_price = price * (1 - discount)).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The price influences the final price, and the customer's age or being a first-time customer influences the discount applied, which in turn affects the final price."
