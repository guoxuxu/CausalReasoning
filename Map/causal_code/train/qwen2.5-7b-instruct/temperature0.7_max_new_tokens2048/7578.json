  "Explanation": "The state 'Gas' only occurs when the temperature is greater than the boiling point, which is calculated based on the pressure. This is a clear causal relationship from the state to the temperature conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
