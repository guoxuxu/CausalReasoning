  "Explanation": "Without intervention, comparing sunny weather with no advertising (70 sales) against rainy day with advertising (approximately 60 sales after 1.5 multiplier of initial rainy day sales of 40), sunny weather without advertising results in higher sales.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
