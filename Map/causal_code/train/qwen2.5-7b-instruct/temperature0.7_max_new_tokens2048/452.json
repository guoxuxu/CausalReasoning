  "Explanation": "Setting the humidity to 50 removes the condition of 'Rainy' due to high humidity, yet the weather condition depends on the actual temperature. Since the temperature condition for 'Sunny' is strictly greater than 30, and the initial temperature is 25, the result would still be 'Rainy'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
