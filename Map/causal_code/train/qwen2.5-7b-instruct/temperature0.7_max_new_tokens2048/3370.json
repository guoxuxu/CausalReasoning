  "Explanation": "The normalize function depends on the cleanup function to remove None values from the data list. Removing None values is necessary because operations like finding maximum or division in normalize would fail with a TypeError on encountering None.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
