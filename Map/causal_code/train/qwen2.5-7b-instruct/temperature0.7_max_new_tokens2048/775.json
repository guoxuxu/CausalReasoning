  "Explanation": "Artificially intervening to set 'is_raining' to False, according to the code, implies that cloud coverage must be 50% or below; this manipulation directly affects the interpretation of the cloud coverage, demonstrating causality from an effect manipulated through intervention back to its cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
