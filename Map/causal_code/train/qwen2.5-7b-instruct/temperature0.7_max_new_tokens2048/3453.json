  "Explanation": "While applying a discount is one possible intervention to reduce the final price, other factors such as a possible decrease in base price itself could also lead to a significant decrease in the final price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
