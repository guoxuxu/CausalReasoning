  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code=None):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == '10OFF' else 0.05 if coupon_code == '5OFF' else 0\n    discount = total * discount_rate\n    total_after_discount = total - discount\n    return total_after_discount\",\n\nIf the total cost before discount appears high, can we infer coupon_code was '10OFF'?",
  "Explanation": "A high total cost before discounts simply reflects the sum of products of 'price' and 'quantity' of the items. It does not inherently indicate the usage of any particular coupon code, as the coupon code affects only the discount rate and subsequently the total cost after discount.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "coupon_code influences discount_rate, which in turn affects discount and total_after_discount. Higher total implies lower total_after_discount, suggesting the use of '10OFF' coupon_code is more likely."
