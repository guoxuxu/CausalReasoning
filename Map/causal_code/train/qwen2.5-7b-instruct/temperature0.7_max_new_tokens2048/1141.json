  "Explanation": "Increased sales could be due to any combination of it being a holiday, the presence of a discount, or sunny weather. Without knowing the status of the other variables, an increase in sales cannot be specifically attributed to sunny weather.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "If the weather is sunny, then the mood is happy which increases sales. Additionally, if there is a holiday, free time increases leading to higher sales. If there is a discount, spending power increases, also boosting sales."
