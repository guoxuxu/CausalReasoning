  "Explanation": "The low ratio (effect) does not inherently mean high pressure (cause); it can also result from very low or zero temperature as seen from the calculation 'z = y / x'. A zero or near-zero temperature can also lead to a low ratio regardless of pressure.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Data['pressure'] is converted to pascal (y) which influences z; data['temperature'] is converted to celsius (x) which determines whether z is calculated as y/x or 0."
