  "Problem": "{\n    \"code\": \"class WeatherSimulator {\n  int temperature;\n  boolean isRaining;\n\n  WeatherSimulator(int temperature, boolean rain) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.isRaining = rain;\n  }\n\n  void updateWeather(int newTemp, boolean newRainStatus) {\n    temperature = newTemp;\n    isRaining = newRainStatus;\n  }\n\n  boolean checkIfSlippery() {\n    if (isRaining && temperature <= 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\"\n  },\n\nIf we manually change the weather condition to not raining, will the roads still become slippery when the temperature is below zero?",
  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting the rain status to false while the temperature is below zero, the condition inside checkIfSlippery that requires both rain and low temperature to be true for slippery roads will not be met, therefore no slippery roads.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
