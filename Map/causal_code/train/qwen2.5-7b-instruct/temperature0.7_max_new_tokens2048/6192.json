  "Explanation": "While `isRaining` being true suggests `temperature` is less than 15, it does not confirm it because `isRaining` could be true if `temperature` is below 15 and `windSpeed` is above 20.0. The high wind speed also influences the raining status.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The determination of whether it is raining depends on both temperature being below 15 and wind speed being above 20.0. If it is raining, then the weather simulation updates the temperature and wind speed accordingly."
