  "Explanation": "The base price is originally set to 100, and it is modified by a random increase of between 5 and 20 before the discount is applied. Therefore, the discounted price would not specifically be 85 since it depends on how much the base price was increased. The final discounted price would be \\( (100 + \\text{{random increase}}) \\times (0.85) \\), which varies depending on the random increase.",
