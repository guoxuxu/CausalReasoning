  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    mean = sum(data) / len(data)\n    adjusted_data = [x - mean for x in data]\n    final_data = [x**2 if x >= 0 else abs(x) for x in adjusted_data]\n    result = sum(final_data)\n    return result\",\n\nIf we adjust the code to scale down the 'data' before calculating the 'mean', will the 'result' systematically change?",
  "Explanation": "Scaling down 'data' before calculating 'mean' reduces both the calculated 'mean' and the magnitude of 'data' points. Since 'adjusted_data' becomes smaller, the final squares or absolute values in 'final_data' are likely reduced, which will usually decrease 'result'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Scaling down the 'data' directly affects the 'mean', which in turn influences the 'adjusted_data'. The 'adjusted_data' then determines the 'final_data', and ultimately impacts the 'result'."
