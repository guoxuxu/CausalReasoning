  "Explanation": "Outdoor events can also be forced (using forceOutdoorEvent() method) regardless of rainy weather, with the use of umbrellas. Therefore, having an outdoor event does not definitely point back to a sunny weather condition due to potential intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
