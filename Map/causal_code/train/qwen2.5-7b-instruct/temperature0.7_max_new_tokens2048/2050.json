  "Explanation": "Given that the heart rate adjusts in increments based on the number of steps (80 + steps_count // 100), a heart rate of 90 indicates (90 - 80) * 100 = 1000 steps, assuming the app was in an active state with step increments.",

Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When the 'increment_steps' method is called, it increases the 'steps_count'. Since the 'adjust_heart_rate' method updates the 'heart_rate' based on the 'steps_count', and given the relationship 'heart_rate = 80 + steps_count // 100', a heart rate of 90 implies 'steps_count' is at least 100. However, there's no direct link showing 'increment_steps' must be called exactly 300 times to reach a heart rate of 90."
