  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    if flag:\n        result = [x * 2 for x in data]\n    else:\n        result = [x + 5 for x in data]\n    filtered_result = [x for x in result if x > 10]\n    return filtered_result\",\n\nIf the input list 'data' only contains values greater than 5, will the output list 'filtered_result' be non-empty when flag is True?",
  "Explanation": "When all values in 'data' are greater than 5 and each value is doubled (flag is True), they all exceed 10, ensuring 'filtered_result' is non-empty.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When flag is True, the result is a list where each element of data is multiplied by 2. If the input data list only contains values greater than 5, the filtered_result will be non-empty because the minimum value after multiplication is 12, which satisfies the condition x > 10."
