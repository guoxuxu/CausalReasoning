  "Explanation": "The temperature increase alone, under clear conditions (isCloudy = false), suggests it becomes warmer, which would not directly lead to becoming cloudy as the conditional logic for cloud formation requires temperature to fall below 0.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in temperature may lead to cloudy weather if the initial conditions cause the temperature to rise above a certain threshold, triggering the updateWeather method which sets isCloudy to true when temperature drops below 0."
