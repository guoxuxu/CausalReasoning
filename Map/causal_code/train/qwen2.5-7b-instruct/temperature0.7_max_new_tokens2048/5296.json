  "Explanation": "An increase in current_temp indicates that the 'heating_on' method was called, but this could happen either due to a low ambient_temp or an adjustment to the desired_temp threshold itself.",

Conversely, if ambient temperature is significantly above the desired temperature, the cooling system turns on, decreasing the current temperature."
