  "Problem": "class Population { constructor(size) { this.size = size; this.health = 100; } increaseSize(increment) { this.size += increment; this.health -= 10; } decreaseSize(decrement) { this.size -= decrement; this.health += 5; } } let town = new Population(500); town.increaseSize(50); town.decreaseSize(30); console.log(town.size); console.log(town.health);\",\n\nIf we modify the increaseSize method to not alter health, and we subsequently increase population size, will health still decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying the increaseSize method to prevent it from affecting health means that increasing the population size no longer results in a decreased health metric, isolating the health variable from changes due to population size adjustments.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
