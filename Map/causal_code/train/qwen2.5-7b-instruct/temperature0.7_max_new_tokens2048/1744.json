  "Problem": "def calculate_prices(base_price, discount, tax_rate):\n    discounted_price = base_price - (base_price * discount)\n    final_price = discounted_price + (discounted_price * tax_rate)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we increase the tax_rate, will the final_price increase, assuming we keep the base_price and discount constant?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the tax_rate raises the amount of tax added to the discounted_price. Since discounted_price is derived from a constant base_price and discount, any increase in tax_rate directly increases the final_price.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the tax_rate increases the final_price, while keeping the base_price and discount constant increases the discounted_price, which in turn increases the final_price."
