  "Explanation": "Simulating rain (using the `simulate_rain` method) that increases humidity actually results in a decrease in temperature whenever the amount of rain is more than 5 due to the condition `if amount > 5: self.temperature -= 3`. Hence, increasing humidity via simulating rain actually decreases the temperature according to the code logic, showing that the effect (higher humidity) does not cause an increase but rather a decrease in temperature.",
