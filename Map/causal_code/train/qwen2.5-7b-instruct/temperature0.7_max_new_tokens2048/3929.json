  "Explanation": "With the intervention altering decide_activity to always return 'going for a walk' regardless of the weather input, observing this specific activity no longer provides information about the weather condition; it could be sunny, rainy, or cloudy.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

An intervention modifying decide_activity to always return 'going for a walk' means observing 'going for a walk' does not indicate any specific weather condition."
