  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    if 'error' in data:\n        data = correct_errors(data)\n    cleaned_data = clean_data(data)\n    processed_data = analyze_data(cleaned_data)\n    return processed_data\n\ndef correct_errors(data):\n    return data.replace('error', 'corrected')\n\ndef clean_data(data):\n    return data.strip()\n\ndef analyze_data(data):\n    if len(data) > 50:\n        return 'Data is too large'\n    else:\n        return 'Data processed successfully'\",\n\nIf the outcome of 'process_data' is 'Data processed successfully', can an intervention in 'analyze_data' that changes its length threshold affect the outcome?",
  "Explanation": "If 'analyze_data' has its threshold for determining data size altered, even originally successful outcomes might now trigger a 'Data is too large' response or continue being successful based on the new criteria. This assessment involves a direct intervention in the effect process and observing if the cause related outcomes are impacted.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention in 'analyze_data' that changes its length threshold can affect the outcome of 'process_data'. Specifically, altering the condition 'len(data) > 50' can change whether 'process_data' returns 'Data is too large' or 'Data processed successfully'."
