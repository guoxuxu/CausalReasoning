  "Explanation": "While an increase in visits generally implies an increase in sales, a significant jump in sales can also be caused by activating a promotion, which doubles the sales increment per visit. Thus, sales can increase significantly either due to more visits or due to the effect of promotion, not definitively one or the other.",
