  "Problem": "def calculate_co2_emissions(vehicle_type, miles_driven, fuel_efficiency):\n    if vehicle_type == 'electric':\n        emissions = 0\n    else:\n        emissions = miles_driven * (1 / fuel_efficiency) * 20\n    return emissions\",\n\nIf 'emissions' are observed to be zero, was the vehicle type 'electric'?",
  "Explanation": "The code specifies that if 'vehicle_type' is 'electric', then 'emissions' are set to zero. This is direct causality from 'vehicle_type' to 'emissions'. No other vehicle type or input condition in the code results in zero emissions, implying that observing zero emissions guarantees the vehicle was electric.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The vehicle type directly determines whether emissions are zero. If the vehicle type is electric, then emissions are zero. If the vehicle type is not electric, emissions are calculated based on miles driven and fuel efficiency."
