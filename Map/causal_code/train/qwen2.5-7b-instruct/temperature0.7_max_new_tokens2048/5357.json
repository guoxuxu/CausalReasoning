  "Explanation": "Using `increaseTargetSales` to raise the price of specific items directly affects those items' selling prices. Assuming the target item constitutes a significant portion of the dataset, this increase could affect the overall average computed by `averageSalePrice`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
