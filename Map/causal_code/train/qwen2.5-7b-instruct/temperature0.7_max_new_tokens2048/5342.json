  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(discount, base_price, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        increase = 0.10\n    else:\n        increase = -0.05\n    price_after_discount = base_price * (1 - discount)\n    final_price = price_after_discount * (1 + increase)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we control base_price and discount but observe an increase in final_price, can we conclude that the season changed to high?",
  "Explanation": "By controlling the base_price and discount and still observing an increase in the final_price, the only factor that can contribute to this outcome under the given function is the season switching to high, which positively affects the increase rate.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
