  "Explanation": "Increasing the ‘base_price’ leads to an increase in the ‘taxable_amount’ since it is directly multiplied by the ‘quantity’ of items. This in turn increases both the 'tax' and the final 'total'. Hence, without any intervention on other parts (like applying discounts or changing the tax rate), increasing the ‘base_price’ causes the ‘total’ to increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in base_price leads to an increase in taxable_amount, which in turn increases the tax, resulting in a higher total."
