  "Explanation": "The change from High to Low risk due to an exercise intervention would more likely be due to a decrease in weight or changes in body composition affecting BMI, not necessarily an increase in height.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
