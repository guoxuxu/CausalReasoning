  "Explanation": "From the conditional statement 'if user.last_login > 30 and user.active:', it is clear that both conditions, user being active and last login being over 30 days ago, must be met before setting `user.active` to False.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
