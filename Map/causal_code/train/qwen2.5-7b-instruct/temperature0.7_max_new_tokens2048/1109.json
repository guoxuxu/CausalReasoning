  "Explanation": "While high temperatures can lead to rain, the rain state can also be influenced by other factors not captured in this limited code context or initialized state (e.g., manual setting of weather conditions). Furthermore, it raining does not necessarily imply that the increase in temperature was the cause, as the initial state might have been manually set or influenced by other operations not shown.",
