  "Explanation": "With repeated intervention by calling the Heal method, regardless of the small increase each time, the cumulative effect will eventually reach the maximum health cap of 100, as there is a hard limit set in the Heal method that prevents health from exceeding 100.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
