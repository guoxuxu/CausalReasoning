It also includes a method to check if the user can rent a car, which depends solely on their driving license status.\"\n  },\n\nIf a new rule is introduced that allows all registered users to have a temporary driving license, regardless of age, will a user of age 17 be able to rent a car?",
  "Explanation": "Adding a new rule to issue a temporary driving license irrespective of age effectively bypasses the age check in `canIssueDrivingLicense()`, directly setting `hasDrivingLicense` to true for all users. Thus, a user aged 17, in this modified scenario, would be able to rent a car because they have a driving license thanks to the new rule. This question explores the causal pathway from an intervention (new rule) to an outcome (ability to rent a car at age 17) with intervention.",
