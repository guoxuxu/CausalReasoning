  "Explanation": "Knowing it's not a holiday only implies the temperature is over 30 degrees. This has no direct correlation with whether it is raining, as the rainfall condition is independent of the holiday status in the WeatherSimulator.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
