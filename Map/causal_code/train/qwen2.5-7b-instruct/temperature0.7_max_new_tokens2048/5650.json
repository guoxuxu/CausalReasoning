  "Explanation": "The `weather_status` 'Cold and Wet' is set when `temperature` < 20 and `humidity` > 70. Increasing the temperature above 20 does not guarantee a change in `weather_status` unless the humidity level also changes, as it could be set to 'Moderate' depending on the new state of `humidity`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
