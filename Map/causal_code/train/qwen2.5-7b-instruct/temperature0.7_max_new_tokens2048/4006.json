  "Problem": "class TrafficSystem { constructor(weather, dayOfWeek) { this.weather = weather; this.dayOfWeek = dayOfWeek; } calculateTraffic() { if (this.weather === 'rainy') { return this.dayOfWeek === 'Monday' ? 'high' : 'medium'; } else { return this.dayOfWeek === 'Monday' ? 'medium' : 'low'; } } } const system = new TrafficSystem('sunny', 'Monday'); const traffic = system.calculateTraffic();\",\n\nIf the weather is changed from 'sunny' to 'rainy', will the traffic prediction change?",
  "Explanation": "The code defines that traffic calculations vary based on the weather condition combined with the day of the week. In the scenario given ('sunny', 'Monday'), the traffic is 'medium'. Changing the weather to 'rainy' while keeping the day as 'Monday' changes the traffic to 'high'.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
