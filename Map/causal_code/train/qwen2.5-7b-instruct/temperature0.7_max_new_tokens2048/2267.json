  "Explanation": "In the given code, rain depends directly on the temperature being above 3 degrees Celsius and it currently not raining ('willItRainTomorrow' method). Simply lowering the temperature from 10 degrees to 5 degrees, without other interventions, does not violate these conditions nor trigger any mechanistic change in the 'isRaining' status since the 'updateWeather' method does not make it start raining if it was not already.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Decreasing the temperature from 10 degrees Celsius to 5 degrees will cause it to no longer be below 0, potentially changing isRaining to false, but will also reduce temperature, making it more likely for isRaining to become true if the new temperature is above 3 and not raining."
