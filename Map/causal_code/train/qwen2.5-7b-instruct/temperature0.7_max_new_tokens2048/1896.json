  "Explanation": "Knowing 'z' equals 25 only informs us that 'y' was originally 30 (since 'z' = 'y' - 5). This tells us 'y' was greater than 20, which could imply 'result' was True. However, 'z' does not inversely influence the computation or value of 'result'; this relationship is not fully deterministic without knowledge of potential other code functionalities or errors.",
