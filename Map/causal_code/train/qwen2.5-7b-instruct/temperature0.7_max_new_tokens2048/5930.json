  "Problem": "def compute_health_score(age, fitness_level, is_smoker):\n    score = 100\n    score -= age\n    if age > 50:\n        score -= 10\n    if fitness_level > 7:\n        score += 20\n    else:\n        score -= 20\n    if is_smoker:\n        score -= 30\n    return score\",\n\nIf a user shows a significant increase in health score, can we infer that they stopped smoking?",
  "Explanation": "While stopping smoking would indeed increase the health score by 30, there are other ways the score could have increased - such as improvements in fitness levels or the individual being in a younger age group. A significant increase cannot solely be attributed to a change in smoking status without eliminating the influence of other factors.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Age negatively affects health score, higher fitness level positively affects health score, and being a smoker negatively affects health score."
