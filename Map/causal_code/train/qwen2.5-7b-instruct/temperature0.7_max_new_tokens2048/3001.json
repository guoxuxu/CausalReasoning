  "Explanation": "Since the intervention standardized the discounts to 15, knowing that the final_price is 85 provides no information on whether the original coupon code was 'SAVE10' or 'SAVE20'. The causal pathway from the original coupon code to the total price has been obscured by the intervention.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "The coupon code influences the discount, which then affects the total price, and finally determines the final price. The price also directly influences the total price, which in turn determines the final price. An intervention updating all discounts to 15 would change the relationship between the coupon code and the final price."
