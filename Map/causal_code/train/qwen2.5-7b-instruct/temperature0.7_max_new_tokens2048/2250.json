  "Explanation": "While the series of Heal interventions could indeed have resulted in reaching full health, we cannot definitively say they were the only cause as health being at 100 could also result from not taking any damage at all. Other factors might include the absence of damage or initial health being maintained at 100.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Calling Heal increases health, while calling TakeDamage decreases health. Therefore, if GetHealth returns 100 after a series of interventions, it indicates that the Heal method was used, but we cannot infer with certainty that no TakeDamage occurred."
