  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data): \n  revenue = sum([item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in data]) \n  costs = sum([item['cost'] * item['quantity'] for item in data]) \n  profit = revenue - costs \n  return {'revenue': revenue, 'profit': profit}\",\n\nIf the 'price' in the data items is increased, will the 'revenue' increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'revenue' is calculated as the sum of the product of 'price' and 'quantity' for each item. Increasing 'price' directly increases the product of 'price' and 'quantity', thereby increasing the sum total that defines 'revenue'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
