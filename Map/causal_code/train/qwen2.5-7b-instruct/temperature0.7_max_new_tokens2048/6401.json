  "Explanation": "Applying the 'SAVE10' coupon sets the discount to 0.1 (10%). Therefore, regardless of the total price, applying the coupon reduces the total purchase cost by directly decreasing the final amount to be paid.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Applying the 'SAVE10' coupon sets the discount to 0.1, which reduces the total price if the total price exceeds 100. Additionally, if the total price is greater than 100, an additional 5% discount is applied, further reducing the total price."
