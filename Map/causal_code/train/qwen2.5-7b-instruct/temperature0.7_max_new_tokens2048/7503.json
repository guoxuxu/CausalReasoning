  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(daily_sales, tax_rate, discount_policy):\n    if discount_policy == 'holiday':\n        discount_rate = 0.2\n    else:\n        discount_rate = 0\n    total_sales = sum(daily_sales)\n    if total_sales > 1000:\n        discount_rate += 0.05\n    tax_amount = total_sales * tax_rate\n    discount_amount = total_sales * discount_rate\n    final_amount = total_sales + tax_amount - discount_amount\n    return final_amount\",\n\nIf we manually set the discount_rate to 0.15 in the code, regardless of daily sales or policy, how will this affect the final_amount?",
  "Explanation": "Manually setting the discount_rate to 0.15 fixes it at a particular value. This intervention affects the final_amount by ensuring it is consistently reduced by 15% of the total_sales, modulating the effect without dependency on total sales amount reaching 1000 or specific discount policies.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
