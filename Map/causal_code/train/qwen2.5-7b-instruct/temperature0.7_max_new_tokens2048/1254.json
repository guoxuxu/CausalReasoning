  "Problem": "def calculate_health(age, smoking_status, exercise_freq):\n    base_health = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health -= (age - 50) * 0.5\n    if smoking_status:\n        base_health -= 20\n    if exercise_freq >= 3:\n        base_health += 15\n    return base_health\",\n\nIf we implement a regimen where a person under 50 begins exercising frequently, will their health score increase?",
  "Explanation": "Exercising frequently (3 or more times a week) increases the person's health score by 15 points as indicated in the function, which is an intervention causing an effect on health.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
