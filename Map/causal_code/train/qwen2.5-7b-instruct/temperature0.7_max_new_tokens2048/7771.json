  "Explanation": "Under non-holiday conditions, `final_sales` directly incorporates the `marketing_spend` multiplied by 0.2 in its formula. Therefore, increasing the `marketing_spend` will directly increase `final_sales`, assuming it is not a holiday.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing marketing spend directly increases final sales, while a holiday increases final sales multiplicatively. Therefore, if marketing spend is increased, final sales will generally increase unless a holiday causes a multiplicative increase that outweighs the additive effect of increased spend."
