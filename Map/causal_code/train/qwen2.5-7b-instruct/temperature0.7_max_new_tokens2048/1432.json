  "Explanation": "Although an increase of 10 in sales would suggest that the region might be 'East' and the season 'Summer', it cannot be conclusively determined without additional information because there could be other factors or interventions affecting the total sales (other code paths or external increase not visible in this snippet).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
