  "Explanation": "According to the system logic in system_update, both the heater and the aircon are set to off only when the current temperature equals the desired temperature. Therefore, if both are off, it indicates (without intention or outside influence) that the temperatures must be equal, giving a clear causal inference from the effect to the cause with intervention handled by the system logic.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "When the current temperature is higher than the desired temperature, the heater is turned off and the air conditioner is turned on; when the current temperature is lower than the desired temperature, the air conditioner is turned off and the heater is turned on. If both the heater and air conditioner are off, it implies that the current temperature is exactly equal to the desired temperature."
