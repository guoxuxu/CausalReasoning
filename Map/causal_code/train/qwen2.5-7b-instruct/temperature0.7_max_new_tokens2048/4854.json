  "Explanation": "The result 'no_action' does not provide information about the 'database_state' since it is returned when 'user_click' is False regardless of the database's state. This is a case of attempting 'from effect to cause with intervention', but there's insufficient data to correlate the non-action to 'database_state' directly when the only known factor is the user's lack of activity.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If user_click is False, then the result will be no_action regardless of db_status. db_status being 'active' leads to update_started or delayed based on user_click. Therefore, if the result is 'no_action', we can conclude that user_click was False, but we cannot determine the original state of database_state."
