  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(ad_budget, season):\n    base_sales = 100\n    if season == 'high':\n        seasonal_multiplier = 1.5\n    elif season == 'low':\n        seasonal_multiplier = 0.75\n    else:\n        seasonal_multiplier = 1.0\n    total_sales = base_sales * seasonal_multiplier + ad_budget * 0.3\n    return total_sales\",\n\nDoes a high total_sales figure imply a high ad_budget?",
  "Explanation": "High total_sales can be due to a high seasonal_multiplier (during the high season) or because of a high ad_budget, or both. Thus, high total_sales do not necessarily imply a high ad_budget since the influence of the season could be predominant.",
