  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulation { constructor(weather) { this.weather = weather; } changeWeather(newWeather) { this.weather = newWeather; } getChanceOfRain() { return this.weather === 'rainy' ? 0.9 : this.weather === 'cloudy' ? 0.5 : 0.1; } isWeatherGoodForHiking() { const chanceOfRain = this.getChanceOfRain(); return chanceOfRain < 0.5; } }\",\n\nIf the weather condition changes to 'rainy', will the chance of rain increase?",
  "Explanation": "The method 'getChanceOfRain' returns a higher chance of rain (0.9) when the weather is 'rainy' compared to other weather conditions. Therefore, changing the weather to 'rainy' directly increases the calculated chance of rain, demonstrating the cause (weather changing to 'rainy') leading to the effect (increase in chance of rain).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
