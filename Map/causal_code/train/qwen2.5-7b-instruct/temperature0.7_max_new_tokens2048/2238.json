  "Explanation": "Resetting the 'status' to 'young' by intervention does not affect the 'age' attribute in the data since status assignment is unidirectional—from 'age' to 'status' in the code and does not establish a mechanism to reverse-infer or modify 'age' based on 'status'. Thus, this intervention on effect does not causally influence the cause.",
