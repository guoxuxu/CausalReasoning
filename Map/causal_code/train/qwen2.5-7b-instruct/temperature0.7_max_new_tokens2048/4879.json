  "Explanation": "Since the function 'correct_errors' is directly responsible for fixing errors before further data processing in 'process_data', a failure to properly fix errors will affect the later stages of data cleaning and analysis, causing 'process_data' to possibly fail in turning out successfully processed data. This is a case of inferring the effects of a change in the cause without intervention elsewhere.",
