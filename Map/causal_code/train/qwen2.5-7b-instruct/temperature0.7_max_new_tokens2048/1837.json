  "Explanation": "The method 'predict_rain' checks if the temperature is less than 50 and humidity is more than 50 to decide if it should predict rain. If both conditions are met, it returns True, indicating rain.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
