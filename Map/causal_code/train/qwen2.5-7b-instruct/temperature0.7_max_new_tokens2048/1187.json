  "Explanation": "Not being hungry after eating does not necessarily mean they had bought food before eating, as they might already have had food or were not hungry to begin with, making the resulting state ambiguous without more context.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
