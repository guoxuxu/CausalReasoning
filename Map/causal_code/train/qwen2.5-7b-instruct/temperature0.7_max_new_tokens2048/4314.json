  "Explanation": "Increased elements in `modified_data` could be due to either lowering the `filter_threshold` or starting with a larger initial dataset, `data`, while keeping the threshold constant. Without information about the initial dataset size or threshold value, we cannot definitively relate changes in `modified_data` solely to changes in `filter_threshold`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "A lower filter_threshold results in more elements in filtered_data; when modify_flag is True, more elements in modified_data compared to filtered_data."
