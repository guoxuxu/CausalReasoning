  "Problem": "def compute_score(health_index, environment_factor, genetic_factor):\n    base_score = 50\n    adjusted_health_score = base_score + (health_index * 10) - (environment_factor * 5)\n    final_score = adjusted_health_score + (genetic_factor * 15)\n    return final_score\",\n\nIf final_score decreases, can it be solely attributed to a decrease in genetic_factor without considering other factors?",
  "Explanation": "In the function, final_score depends not only on genetic_factor but also on health_index and environment_factor. A decrease in final_score could be due to changes in any of these variables; thus we cannot conclusively attribute a drop in final_score only to a decrease in genetic_factor without controlling for or considering changes in the other variables.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
