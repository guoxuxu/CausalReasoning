  "Explanation": "When applyDiscount is true, the processOrder method reduces the orderValue by a certain percentage determined by the discountRate. Since discountRate is either 5 or 20, finalPrice will always be less than orderValue.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
