  "Explanation": "A decrease in mortality could be due to various factors such as an increase in healthcare effectiveness, reduced mortality factor or other external interventions not covered by 'introduce_healthcare_policy'. We cannot definitively infer the introduction of healthcare policies from this observation alone without more information.",
