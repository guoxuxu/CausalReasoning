  "Explanation": "Setting `isRaining` to true through an intervention (e.g., directly modifying the value without calling `updateWeather` or `determineRainStatus`) does not provide information about the actual weather conditions such as `windSpeed` or `temperature` that led to that state. Thus, we cannot infer `windSpeed` was above 20.0 based on `isRaining` alone if it's set by intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "An intervention setting `isRaining` to true does not confirm that `windSpeed` was necessarily above 20.0, because `isRaining` can also be true when `temperature` is less than 15 regardless of `windSpeed`. Conversely, `windSpeed` being above 20.0 alone does not guarantee `isRaining`, as `temperature` must also be below 15 for `isRaining` to be true."
