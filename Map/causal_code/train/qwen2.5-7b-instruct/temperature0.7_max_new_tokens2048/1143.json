  "Explanation": "The observed increase in sales could potentially be influenced by increased free time during holidays rather than an improvement in mood. Additionally, mood is directly dictated by weather in the provided model, not by whether or not it is a holiday.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
