  "Explanation": "Sunlight hours contribute to a rise in plant growth with a coefficient of 3 in the updatePlantGrowth function. Adding 3 hours would directly contribute to an increase in plant growth by increasing the input to the formula with a multiplier of 3, implying a cause to effect relationship without intervention in other variables.",
