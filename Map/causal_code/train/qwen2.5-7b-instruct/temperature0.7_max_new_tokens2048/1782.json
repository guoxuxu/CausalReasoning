  "Problem": "def update_inventory(products, sold, restocked):\n    inventory = {product: stock for product, stock in products.items()}\n    for product in sold:\n        if product in inventory:\n            inventory[product] -= sold[product]\n    for product in restocked:\n        if product in inventory:\n            inventory[product] += restocked[product]\n    return inventory\",\n\nIf the 'sold' dictionary reports more items sold for a product, will the final inventory quantity of that product decrease?",
  "Explanation": "According to the causal link from cause (items sold) to effect (inventory quantity) without intervention, increasing the count of sold items naturally decreases the available count in the inventory for that product, as the code subtracts the sold items from the current inventory. This effect directly follows from the cause without any intermediary steps or external influences altering the outcome.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
