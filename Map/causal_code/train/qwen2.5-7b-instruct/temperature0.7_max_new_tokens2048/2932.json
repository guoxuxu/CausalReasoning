  "Explanation": "Increasing 'increment_by' increases 'B', which could increase 'C' if 'B' stays below or just crosses over 20. However, because 'D' equals 'C' minus 'A', and 'A' is independent from 'increment_by', the relative increase in 'C' may not proportionally affect 'D' depending on the arithmetic operations and conditions involving the crossing over the threshold of 20. Therefore, solely increasing 'increment_by' doesn’t guarantee a higher 'D'.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the 'increment_by' value directly increases B, which may increase C and subsequently D, while doubling A also influences C, reducing D if A's contribution is significant."
