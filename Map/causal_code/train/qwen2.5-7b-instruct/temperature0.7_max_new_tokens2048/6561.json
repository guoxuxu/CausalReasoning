  "Explanation": "A decrease in totalSales suggests that applyDiscount could have been called, but it's also possible that sales were recorded inaccurately or negative amounts were mistakenly passed to recordSale. External factors not shown in the provided code could also affect totalSales.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
