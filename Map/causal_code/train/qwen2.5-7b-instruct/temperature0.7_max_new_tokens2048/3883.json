  "Explanation": "While the code decrements scores not containing 'team_a' (like team_b) by the penalty points, the decrease in team_b's scores alone doesn’t necessarily imply an increase in penalty_points; scores could decrease for other reasons not covered in the provided code, such as initialization to a lower value before calling update_scores().",
