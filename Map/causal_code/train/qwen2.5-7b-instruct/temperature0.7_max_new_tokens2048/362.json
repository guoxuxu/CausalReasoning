  "Explanation": "Raining can be started by calling the 'startRain' method. Although this method reduces the temperature by 5 degrees if it was above 25, raining could still have been triggered without the temperature ever being above 25 initially.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
