  "Explanation": "When the quiz consists of more than 5 questions, each student’s stress level is increased by 1. Consequently, teachers evaluating student performance may observe increased stress levels, especially for those students whose stress levels exceed a certain threshold (level 2 in this scenario).",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
