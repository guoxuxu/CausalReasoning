  "Problem": "def process_sales_data(prices, discounts, tax_rate): \n    discounted_prices = [p * (1 - d) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)] \n    total = sum(discounted_prices) \n    tax_amount = total * tax_rate \n    final_total = total + tax_amount \n    return final_total\",\n\nIf we manually set all values in 'discounts' to zero, will this result in a higher 'final_total' assuming other variables are unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'discounts' to zero removes any reductions on 'prices', resulting in higher or unchanged 'discounted_prices' and therefore an increased 'total'. This in turn increases the 'tax_amount' derived from the 'total', leading to an increased 'final_total' when tax_rate remains constant.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

  "causal_integration_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting all values in 'discounts' to zero will directly cause 'discounted_prices' to be equal to 'prices', which in turn will cause 'total' to be higher, resulting in a higher 'final_total'."
