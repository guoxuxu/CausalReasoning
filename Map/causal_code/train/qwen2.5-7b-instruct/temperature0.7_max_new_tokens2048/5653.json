  "Problem": "class WeatherSystem {\n  int temperature;\n  bool isRaining;\n  void changeWeather(int tempChange) {\n    temperature += tempChange;\n    if (temperature < 0) {\n      isRaining = false;\n    }\n  }\n  void startRain() {\n    if (temperature > 5) {\n      isRaining = true;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf you manually set 'isRaining' to true when the temperature is 10 degrees, will it continue to rain assuming no other changes are made to the code?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'isRaining' was set explicitly to true and there is no code to change it back to false based on the temperature being 10 degrees, it will continue to rain assuming the weather system remains unchanged.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
