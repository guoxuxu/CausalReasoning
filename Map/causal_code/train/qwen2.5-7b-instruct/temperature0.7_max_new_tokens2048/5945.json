  "Explanation": "Reducing the initial inventory count of 'apple' will directly affect the ending inventory count post the sales process, provided all other conditions remain the same, leading to a lower final count.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Reducing the initial quantity of 'apple' in the inventory will decrease the final count of 'apple' in 'new_inventory' if it is sold. The presence of 'sold_items' triggers the update process, which may reduce the count of items in 'new_inventory' based on the available stock."
