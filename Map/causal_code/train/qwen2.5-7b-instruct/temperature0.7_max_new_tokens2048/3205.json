  "Problem": "def update_inventory(stock, item, quantity, sold):\n    if item in stock:\n        if sold:\n            stock[item] -= quantity\n            return 'Item sold'\n        else:\n            stock[item] += quantity\n            return 'Stock updated'\n    else:\n        if not sold:\n            stock[item] = quantity\n            return 'New item added'\n        else:\n            return 'Item not in stock'\",\n\nKnowing that the response from the function was 'New item added', does this necessarily imply that the item was not initially in stock?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, the message 'New item added' is specifically returned when an attempt to sell an item that does not exist in stock is made, thus directly adding it to the inventory. This is an effect directly tied to its specific cause (the item not being in stock initially).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"<concise natural-language causal description>\"}.\n",
  "causal_map_integration": "If an item is not initially in stock (item_not_in_stock), then 'New item added' will be the response. If an item is already in stock (item_in_stock), the response will be 'Stock updated'. If an item is sold (item_sold), the response will be 'Item sold'."
