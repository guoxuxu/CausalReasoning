  "Explanation": "Returning True from analyze_data simply means that the average of processed_data is greater than 10. It does not confirm specifics about how data_sequence was modified or about the minimal values it includes post-intervention. Various configurations of data_sequence values above 5 (not necessarily greater than 7) could yield an average greater than 10 when processed and tripled.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Values greater than 5 in data_sequence are tripled in process_data, resulting in modified_data. The average of modified_data influences the result of analyze_data, which returns True if average is greater than 10."
