  "Explanation": "Without intervention, decreasing the environment temperature naturally causes a reduction in the current temperature if the heater remains off. According to the update_temperature method, the current temperature is set to environment temperature minus 5 when the heater is off.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
