  "Problem": "def calculate_performance(sales, expenses):\n    net_profit = sales - expenses\n    roi = (net_profit / expenses) * 100\n    return roi\n\nsales_data = [200, 500, 700]\nexpenses_data = [50, 150, 200]\nperformance_scores = []\nfor sales, expenses in zip(sales_data, expenses_data):\n    score = calculate_performance(sales, expenses)\n    if score > 30:\n        performance_scores.append({\"sales\": sales, \"score\": score})\",\n\nCan the increase in performance scores suggest an increase in sales?",
  "Explanation": "While not definitive due to potential changes in expenses, in general, higher performance scores, which indicate higher ROI, suggest that sales have increased if the expenses remain constant or have not increased proportionally as much. This is derived by reversing the cause-effect relationship in the performance score calculation.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
