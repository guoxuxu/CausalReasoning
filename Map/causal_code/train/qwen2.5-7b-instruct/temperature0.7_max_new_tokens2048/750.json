  "Explanation": "With intervention, where an external step ensures all inputs are devoid of 'bug', has_errors will remain False regardless of whether 'bug' was originally in the input or not. Therefore, the user_experience will not be affected by whether 'bug' was initially present since it's removed pre-evaluation.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
