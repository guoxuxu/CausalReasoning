  "Explanation": "Improving health from poor to average increases the base_score by removing a 30 point penalty and applying only a 10 point penalty, resulting in a net gain of 20 points in score.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
