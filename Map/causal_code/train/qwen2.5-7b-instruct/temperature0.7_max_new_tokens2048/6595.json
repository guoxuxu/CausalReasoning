  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  if 'price' in data:\n    data['discounted_price'] = data['price'] * 0.9\n  if 'inventory' in data and data['inventory'] > 20:\n    data['sale'] = True\n  return data\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in 'discounted_price', can we infer that the 'price' was increased?",
  "Explanation": "Given the formula for 'discounted_price' is dependent solely on 'price' despite being a direct 90% reduction, an increase in 'discounted_price' inherently suggests that the 'price' must have increased.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
