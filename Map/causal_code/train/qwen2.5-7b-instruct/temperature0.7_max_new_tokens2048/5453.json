  "Problem": "class ProductSalesAnalysis {\n  int unitsSold;\n  double salePrice;\n  double discountRate;\n\n  ProductSalesAnalysis(int units, double price, double discount) {\n    unitsSold = units;\n    salePrice = price;\n    discountRate = discount;\n  }\n\n  double calculateRevenue() {\n    return unitsSold * salePrice * (1 - discountRate);\n  }\n\n  void updatePrice(double newPrice) {\n    salePrice = newPrice;\n  }\n\n  void applyDiscount(double newDiscount) {\n    discountRate = newDiscount;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the `salePrice` is manually increased using `updatePrice(double newPrice)`, will `calculateRevenue()` potentially reflect higher revenue for the same `unitsSold` and `discountRate`?",
  "Explanation": "From cause to effect with intervention: Manually updating the `salePrice` through `updatePrice(double newPrice)` method directly influences the revenue calculation by increasing the multiplier for `unitsSold` in `calculateRevenue()`, thus potentially increasing it if `unitsSold` and `discountRate` remain unchanged.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
