  "Explanation": "By installing wind barriers to effectively reduce wind speeds, even if high rain probabilities exist (triggered by other factors like high humidity and low temperature), the combination with reduced wind can prevent stormy conditions.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Wind speed directly influences whether a storm is predicted, while temperature and humidity determine the rain probability."
