  "Explanation": "Setting all ages to a constant value effectively removes the variation in age. Since `risk_factor` calculation is directly proportional to `age` (age multiplied by 0.2), this would result in the same `risk_factor` for every entry, removing variability in `risk_factor` values.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Setting all ages to a constant value in the `clean` function reduces the variability of `high_income`['age'], which in turn reduces the variability of `high_income`['risk_factor'] because `risk_factor` is calculated as `age * 0.2`. Additionally, setting all ages to a constant indirectly affects `high_income`['risk_factor'] through its impact on `high_income`."
