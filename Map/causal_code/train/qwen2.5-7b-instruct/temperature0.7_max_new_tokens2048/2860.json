  "Problem": "class SalesAnalyzer { int numberOfSales; double pricePerUnit; SalesAnalyzer(int sales, double price) { numberOfSales = sales; pricePerUnit = price; } double calculateRevenue() { return numberOfSales * pricePerUnit; } void increasePrice(double increment) { pricePerUnit += increment; } double predictedRevenue(double increment) { double newPrice = pricePerUnit + increment; return numberOfSales * newPrice; } }\",\n\nIf the method `increasePrice(double increment)` is called, will the `predictedRevenue(double increment)` necessarily show an increase?",
  "Explanation": "Invoking `increasePrice()` increases `pricePerUnit`, and `predictedRevenue()` calculates revenue using this increased price. Assuming `numberOfSales` remains constant, the increase in `pricePerUnit` causes an increase in predicted revenue according to the equation provided.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "When the increment is applied, it increases the pricePerUnit, which in turn increases the newPrice and subsequently the predictedRevenue."
