  "Explanation": "A non-zero total_savings suggests that a discount was applied, but this can occur with any order_status provided that the appropriate conditions in 'promo_applied' and 'user_category' are fulfilled. Therefore, we cannot infer the order_status directly from the savings amount without additional information.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If the order status is 'pending' and a promotion is applied, then the discount is determined based on the user category. If the order status is 'pending' and no promotion is applied, the discount is also determined by the user category. A premium user receives a higher discount compared to a non-premium user. The discount directly affects the total savings, such that if the discount is greater than zero, total savings will also be greater than zero. Conversely, if total savings are greater than zero, it indicates that either the order was 'pending' or a promotion was applied.",
