  "Problem": "{\n    \"Description\": \"In a fictional program, the system increases the heat or cooling based on a desired temperature set.

  "Explanation": "Manually adjusting the actual temperature to be closer to the desired temperature reduces the temperature_difference, potentially moving it below the higher threshold, which would reduce the fan speed according to the logic set in the control system.",
