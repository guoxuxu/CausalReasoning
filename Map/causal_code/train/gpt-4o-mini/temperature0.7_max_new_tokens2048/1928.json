  "Explanation": "Performance is a function of systemLoad, not directly of debugMode status. High performance indicates that systemLoad is 50 or below. However, this could be achieved through other adjustments or inherently low load, without necessarily changing the debugMode. Thus manually setting performance to high doesn’t predicate the changing of debugMode status, showing the causal disconnect in the scenario of altering effect to expect changes in cause with intervention.",
