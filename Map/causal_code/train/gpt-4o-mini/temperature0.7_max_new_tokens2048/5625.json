  "Explanation": "From cause to effect with intervention: Activating the discount (changing has_discount to True) and setting a discount rate higher than 0 leads to a reduction in the discount_amount, which directly decreases the final_price, given that the tax_rate and base_price remain constant. This intervention directly affects the computation of discount_amount which subsequently lowers the final_price.",
