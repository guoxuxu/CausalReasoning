  "Explanation": "The weather status 'Moderate and Dry' implies that the humidity was below 30 due to manual setting or initialization. As per the code, 'Moderate' comes from a temperature between 10 and 30, and ' and Dry' from a humidity below 30. The causal intervention here would be setting the humidity below 30 during instantiation or update.",
