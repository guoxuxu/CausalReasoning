  "Explanation": "In the given logic, different levels of performance ratings yield different bonus percentages. A change in bonus from one tier to another (e.g., 0% to 10%, or 10% to 20%) strongly implies a change in performance rating across the specific thresholds set in the function (rating of 5 or 8).",
