  "Explanation": "A decrease in the result can occur due to changes in either x, y, or both. Decreasing y or having x switch signs (positive to negative, making v decrease more sharply via the else block) can also decrease the result. Therefore, a decrease in the result does not solely imply a decrease in x.",
