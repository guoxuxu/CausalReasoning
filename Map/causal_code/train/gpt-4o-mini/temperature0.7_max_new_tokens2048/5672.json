  "Explanation": "A decrease in the output value could be due to either having fewer large numbers resulting in smaller `modified_data` values post-multiplication, or to some other factor affecting the `result`(such as all values being at the lower end above 10). Merely having more elements ≤ 10 won't directly influence the output unless it impacts the quantities of elements >10.",
