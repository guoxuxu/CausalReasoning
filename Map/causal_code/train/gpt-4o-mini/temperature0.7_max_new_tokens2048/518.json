  "Problem": "def temperature_adjustment(sensor_data): \n  temp = sensor_data['temperature'] \n  humidity = sensor_data['humidity'] \n  if humidity > 50: \n    adjustment = 0.1 * (humidity - 50) \n  else:  \n    adjustment = 0 \n  adjusted_temp = temp - adjustment \n  return adjusted_temp \n \n sensor_data = {'temperature': 80, 'humidity': 60} \n print(temperature_adjustment(sensor_data))\",\n\nIf the adjusted temperature is observed to be lower than expected, can we conclude that the humidity was higher than 50?",
  "Explanation": "Because a reduction in adjusted temperature as opposed to the base temperature only occurs if the humidity contribution computation (humidity above 50 leading to a positive adjustment value) was triggered. Hence, observation of a decreased temperature implies humidity was indeed above 50.",
