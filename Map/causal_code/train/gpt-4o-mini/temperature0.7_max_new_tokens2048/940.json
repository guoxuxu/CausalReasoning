  "Explanation": "The increase in temperature alone (assuming it stays below 25°C assuming it started below 20°C) does not directly affect the raining condition unless it exceeds 30°C, which is not the case here as specified in the question. Hence, it will still be raining if the initial conditions are met and no other interventions are applied.",
