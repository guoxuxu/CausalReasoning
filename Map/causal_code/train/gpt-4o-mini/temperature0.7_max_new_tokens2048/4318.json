  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand, advertisement_expense, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        season_factor = 1.2\n    else:\n        season_factor = 0.8\n    base_sales = price * demand * season_factor\n    if advertisement_expense > 1000:\n        return base_sales * 1.1\n    else:\n        return base_sales\",\n\nIf sales increased, can we conclude that the season was necessarily high?",
  "Explanation": "The increase in sales can be due to several factors besides just the season being high; other factors include increased advertisement expense (which scales sales by 1.1 if greater than 1000), or even interactions between price, demand, and the season factor. Therefore, high sales do not directly imply that the season is 'high', due to potential contributions from other factors.",
