  "Explanation": "Observing the same `total` after certain operations doesn’t guarantee the sequence of operations due to the methods' implementation. Adding the same monetary amount as the discounted amount previously removed can lead to the same `total`, irrespective of the order of operations. Therefore, the sequence of applying discount and then adding an item cannot be inferred just from the unchanged `total`.",
