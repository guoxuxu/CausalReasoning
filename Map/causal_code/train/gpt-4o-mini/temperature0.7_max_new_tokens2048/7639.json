  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator { constructor(temperature, humidity, windSpeed) { this.temperature = temperature; this.humidity = humidity; this.windSpeed = windSpeed; } forecastWeather() { if (this.temperature > 20) { if (this.humidity > 50) return 'rainy'; else return 'sunny'; } else if (this.windSpeed > 15) return 'stormy'; return 'cloudy'; } static interveneHumidity(weather, newHumidity) { weather.humidity = newHumidity; return weather.forecastWeather(); } }\",\n\nIf we manually set the humidity to 80% in a scenario where the temperature is over 20 degrees Celsius, will the forecast change to 'rainy'?",
  "Explanation": "Using the interveneHumidity method changes the humidity attribute of the WeatherSimulator instance. When humidity is increased to 80% while the temperature remains over 20, the forecasting logic in forecastWeather method will now result in 'rainy', based on the temperature and updated humidity conditions.",
