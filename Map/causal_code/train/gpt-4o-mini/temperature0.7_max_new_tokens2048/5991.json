  "Explanation": "Increasing the range of values in the data list makes the distribution more spread out about its mean, but since the classification into True or False depends on the comparison with the normalized mean (which remains consistent relative to the standardized distribution), the proportion of values classified as 'True' does not necessarily increase.",
