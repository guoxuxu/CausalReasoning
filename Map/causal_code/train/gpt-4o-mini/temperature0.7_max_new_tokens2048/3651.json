  "Explanation": "The 'risk_level' is set to 'high' only when 'humidity' is greater than 50. Although 'risk_level' being 'high' strongly indicates that 'humidity' was above 50, without additional data or conditions confirming that no other factors influenced humidity, certainty can't be absolute. However, within the provided code, this is a valid inference.",
