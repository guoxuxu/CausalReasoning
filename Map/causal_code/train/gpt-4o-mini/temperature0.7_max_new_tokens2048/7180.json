  "Explanation": "With the subtraction of 5, the new formula would be (input_data * 2 - 5). An output 'Low' means final_result <= 20. Even if the original input_value was more than 5 (i.e., 6, gives 6*2 - 5 = 7), it might still yield 'Low' depending on the exact input values. Therefore, one cannot conclusively determine the original input_value based solely on the final 'Low' output under this new operation.",
