  "Explanation": "Intervening by setting a higher 'original' value increases the 'adjusted' value. Changing the environment to urban adds a further 20 to the already increased 'adjusted' value, resulting in a higher 'final' value compared to a non-urban environment, where the increase in 'adjusted' value is offset by subtracting 10.",
