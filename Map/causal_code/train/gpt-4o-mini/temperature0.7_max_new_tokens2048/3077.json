  "Explanation": "While predict_future_sales()'s output depends on the sum of 'units', an increase could stem from initial data configuration or other data manipulations not necessarily tied to the update_sales() method. Without more context or direct tracking of method calls, we cannot conclusively derive that update_sales() was the cause of increased projections.",
