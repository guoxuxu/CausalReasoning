  "Explanation": "In the given function, 'process_data', the output is directly proportional to the input data since it multiplies the input by 2. Therefore, changing the input data would necessarily change the output.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
