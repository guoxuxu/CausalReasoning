  "Explanation": "An increase in budget does not directly confirm that the method was altered specifically to sell premium tickets without budget constraints. The increase could also be from many other methods and activities within the class, including increased sales of regular tickets or additional incomes from finalizing events with a lot of premium sales already possible under existing conditions.",
