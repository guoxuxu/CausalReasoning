  "Explanation": "If 'filtered_data' contains values less than the initial values, it implies data was modified post-filtering. Since values are multiplied by 0.9 only when 'apply_correction' is enabled and they are greater than the threshold, it suggests that 'apply_correction' was indeed enabled.",
