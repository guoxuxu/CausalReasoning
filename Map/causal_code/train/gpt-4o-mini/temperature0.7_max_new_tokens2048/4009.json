  "Explanation": "Rainy weather does not always indicate higher traffic compared to sunny weather due to the interaction with the day of the week. On 'Monday', rainy weather leads to 'high' traffic versus 'medium' under sunny weather. However, on days other than 'Monday', both rainy and sunny lead to 'medium' and 'low' traffic respectively, which does not show a consistent increase.",
