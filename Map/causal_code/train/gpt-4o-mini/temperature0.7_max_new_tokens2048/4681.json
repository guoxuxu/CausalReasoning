  "Problem": "def calculate_health_condition(age, smoker, activity_level):\n    risk_factor = 2 if smoker else 1\n    if age > 50:\n        risk_factor *= 1.5\n    if activity_level == 'low':\n        risk_factor *= 1.2\n    elif activity_level == 'high':\n        risk_factor *= 0.8\n    return 'high-risk' if risk_factor > 2.5 else 'low-risk'\",\n\nIf we intervene and change a smoker's status to non-smoker, while keeping other factors constant, would that transition their health condition from 'high-risk' to 'low-risk'?",
  "Explanation": "Changing a smoker's status to non-smoker decreases the risk factor (from 2 to 1). This change, assuming the other factors do not push the risk factor above 2.5, generally leads to a lower total risk and likely transitions their health condition from 'high-risk' to 'low-risk'.",
