  "Explanation": "The response to a price increase affecting sales depends on whether the customer is part of the loyalty program and what the existing price and discount are. The calculation of 'effective_price' and the subsequent sales numbers can vary. If 'effective_price' stays below 20 after the price increment, sales might not decrease.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
