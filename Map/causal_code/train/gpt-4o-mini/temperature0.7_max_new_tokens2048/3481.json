  "Explanation": "Observing an increase in the size of 'processed_data' implies that the conditional inclusion criteria might have been broadened. Since a broader condition would allow more of the smaller values from 'data' to pass through (from original entries in 'data'), it suggests that the condition likely was adjusted to include smaller numbers.",
