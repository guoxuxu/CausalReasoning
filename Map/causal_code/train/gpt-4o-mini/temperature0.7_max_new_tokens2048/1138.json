  "Explanation": "Increasing 'beta' raises the amount of 'fertilizer', which directly influences 'yield_output'. Since 'yield_output' is calculated as a sum of contributions from both rainfall (controlled by 'alpha') and fertilizer (controlled by 'beta'), increasing 'beta' will increase the yield output, illustrating a causal effect with intervention.",
