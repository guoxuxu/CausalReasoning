  "Explanation": "Decreasing the 'principal' would not necessarily be an effective intervention here. Although reducing 'principal' would lower the 'final_amount', which is the observed outcome, the question on utility of the intervention depends heavily on the specific goal (e.g., reducing costs, maximizing outputs). If the goal is to optimize investment return or savings, decreasing 'principal' might not support objectives of yield maximization.",
