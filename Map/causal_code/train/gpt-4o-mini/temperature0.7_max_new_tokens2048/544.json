  "Explanation": "Changing the rainy status to not rainy does not provide any reliable information about the initial temperature conditions when it was considered bad weather. The temperature could have been below 20 degrees and yet qualify as bad weather when it was rainy.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Changing the weather to not rainy directly leads to the condition of being rainy becoming false, which eliminates the possibility of bad weather occurring. Bad weather is defined by both low temperature and rain; therefore, if bad weather was present, it implies that the temperature was below 20 degrees. Thus, an intervention that eliminates rain does not provide definitive information about the previous temperature being above 20 degrees.",
