  "Explanation": "Since the output of the function depends directly on the calculated 'result', which in turn depends on the 'adjusted' value calculated using the 'original' and 'factor', a change in 'original' would affect 'adjusted', and potentially the final output, assuming other variables ('factor') remain constant.",
