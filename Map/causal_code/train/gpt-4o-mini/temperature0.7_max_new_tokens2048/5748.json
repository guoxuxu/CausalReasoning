  "Explanation": "A 'High' output indicates that 'intermediate > 150'. This could occur both when 'action_flag' is True (resulting in multiplication) and when it is False (resulting in addition by 100), as long as the 'data_point' is sufficiently high to push 'intermediate' over 150. Thus, a 'High' output alone does not definitively indicate the state of 'action_flag'.",
