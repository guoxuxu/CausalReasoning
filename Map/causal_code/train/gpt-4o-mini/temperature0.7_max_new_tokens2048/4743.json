  "Explanation": "The result variable is calculated as z multiplied by y. The value of z depends on the value of x and the condition 'flag'. Regardless of the 'flag' state (True or False), an increase in 'x' will increase 'z' (either as '2*x' or 'x+5'), and hence, if y remains constant, 'result' will increase.",
