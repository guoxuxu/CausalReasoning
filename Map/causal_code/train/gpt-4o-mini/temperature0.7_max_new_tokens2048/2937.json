  "Explanation": "The original initialization, which sets each teacher to have 30 students, remains unchanged. Changes due to intervention (like hiring more teachers for the same or reduced number of students, thereby affecting the ratio) do not affect how the original code structurally assigns students per teacher at initialization.",
