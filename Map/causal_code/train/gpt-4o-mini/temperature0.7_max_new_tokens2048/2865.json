  "Explanation": "A max statistic of less than 10 doesn't necessarily imply that the clean_data method was changed to exclude values above 10; it might simply be that the highest value in the original data was below 10 after removing negative values. Without further information about changes to the method or examining original data, this conclusion is unfounded.",
