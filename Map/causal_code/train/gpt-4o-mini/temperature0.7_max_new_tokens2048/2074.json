  "Explanation": "While 'discounted_price' is influenced by 'season' (different discount rates), the reverse isn't necessarily true. The calculation of 'discounted_price' also depends on 'price'. A change in 'discounted_price' could equally well be due to a change in the 'price' rather than the 'season'.",
