  "Explanation": "The weather status 'Mild and Humid' directly indicates the temperature was between 10 and 30 and the humidity was above 70. There is a straightforward path from observing this effect back to these specific conditions, reinforced by knowing that the update must have been triggered by either 'set_temperature' or 'set_humidity' method or both.",
