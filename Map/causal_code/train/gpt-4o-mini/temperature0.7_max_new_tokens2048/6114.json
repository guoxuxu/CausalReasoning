  "Problem": "def student_grades(hours_studied, class_attendance, current_grade):\n    if class_attendance > 75:\n        performance_boost = 0.1\n    else:\n        performance_boost = 0\n\n    if hours_studied > 5:\n        study_boost = 0.2\n    else:\n        study_boost = 0\n\n    final_grade = current_grade + (current_grade * (performance_boost + study_boost))\n    return final_grade\n\ninitial_grade = 70\nfinal_score = student_grades(6, 80, initial_grade)\",\n\nIf the performance boost is significantly higher, can we assume that the class attendance was also high?",
  "Explanation": "A high performance boost could be a direct result of an intervention that adjusts how performance boost is calculated in relation to class attendance. Therefore, observing a high performance boost does not necessarily indicate actual high attendance without knowing if any interventions (e.g., changes in performance calculation) took place.",
