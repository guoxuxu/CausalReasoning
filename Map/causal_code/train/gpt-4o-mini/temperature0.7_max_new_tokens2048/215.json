  "Explanation": "Setting the initial 'data' to 6 leads to 'result' being 12 after processing (data * 2). Since 12 is greater than 10, the condition in the if statement is true, therefore the 'output' would be 'High'. This is a direct cause-effect scenario with an intervention on the initial cause.",
