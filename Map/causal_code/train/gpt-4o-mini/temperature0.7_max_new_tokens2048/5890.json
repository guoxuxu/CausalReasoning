  "Explanation": "While an improvement in data quality might suggest enhancements in the preprocessing stages, it is not conclusive evidence alone that a specific pre-processing step was added, as improvements could also be due to other factors such as changes in the data source quality or modifications in other parts of the data processing pipeline.",
