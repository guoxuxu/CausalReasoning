  "Explanation": "According to the code logic within the TrafficSystem class, traffic lights turn on when the number of cars exceeds 10. This scenario presumes no external intervention (like manually manipulating the traffic light system) and follows from the system's automatic response to increased traffic.",

Decreasing traffic leads to a reduction in the number of cars, and if the number of cars falls to 10 or below, it causes the traffic lights to be deactivated. Installing traffic lights directly results in their presence, while removing traffic lights causes their absence if the number of cars is 10 or less.",
