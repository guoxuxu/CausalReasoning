  "Explanation": "Changing the multiplier affects the scale of the output but does not inherently provide more accuracy or information about the original 'value'. The transformation (squaring, followed by scaling) obscures the original 'value' linear proportionality and simply changing the multiplier does not reveal more about the specific 'value', especially given the potential for multiple values leading to the same output.",
