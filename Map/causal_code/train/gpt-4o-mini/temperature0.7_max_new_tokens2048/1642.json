  "Explanation": "Decreases in 'maximum_sales' could occur due to data manipulation that does not necessarily involve removing the highest sales figures (e.g., adjusting values rather than removing them). Without specific knowledge of the changes applied to 'sales_data', no definitive conclusion can be drawn about the cause of a change in 'maximum_sales'.",
