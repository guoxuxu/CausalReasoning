  "Explanation": "An unchanged average does not necessarily imply that no values were added or removed. It is possible to add or remove values such that the changes in sum compensated for the changes in the number of elements, thus keeping the average same. This question tests the understanding of retracing steps from an unchanged effect (average) back to the nature of the cause (modification in the data set) with intervention.",
