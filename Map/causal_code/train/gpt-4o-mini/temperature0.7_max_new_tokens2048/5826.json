  "Problem": "def update_sales(price, promotion): \n    if promotion: \n        sales = price * 0.9 * 1.5 \n    else: \n        sales = price * 1.2 \n    return sales\",\n\nAssuming an intervention increases sales, can we infer that the price was certainly reduced?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in sales following an intervention doesn't necessarily correlate to a reduction in price. Sales increase might also result from applying a promotion, independent of any price changes. Thus, an intervention leading to increased sales does not definitively indicate a price reduction.",
