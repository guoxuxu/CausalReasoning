  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(discount, base_price, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        increase = 0.10\n    else:\n        increase = -0.05\n    price_after_discount = base_price * (1 - discount)\n    final_price = price_after_discount * (1 + increase)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the season changes from low to high, would the final_price increase, assuming no changes in discount and base_price?",
  "Explanation": "The 'season' directly affects the 'increase' which in turn modifies the 'final_price'. When the season changes from low to high, 'increase' changes from -0.05 to 0.10, leading to a higher final_price.",
