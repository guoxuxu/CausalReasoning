  "Explanation": "Removing an item decreases the total cost required (now 20 dollars for 2 items at 10 dollars each), and since 40 dollars is sufficiently above 20 dollars, Alex will still purchase the remaining items. This response tests the effect of a causal intervention (item removal) on Alex's ability to purchase.",
