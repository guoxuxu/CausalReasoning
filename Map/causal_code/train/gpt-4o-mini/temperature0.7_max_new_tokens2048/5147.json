  "Explanation": "The accuracy calculation in validate_model depends directly on the number of data points used (data_used from model), not directly on their non-null status. While having more non-null entries increases the data points used to train the model, the validation accuracy relies on a fixed simplification that just scales the count of used data points. Since the output is capped at 1.0, once enough data points are used to reach or exceed the score of 100, the proportion of non-null to null data becomes irrelevant as long as the count remains above this threshold.",
