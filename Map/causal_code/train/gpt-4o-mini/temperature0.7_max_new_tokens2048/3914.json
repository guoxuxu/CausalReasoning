  "Explanation": "Increasing the `base_sales` directly increases `projected_sales` because `projected_sales` is computed as `base_sales` multiplied by a season-dependent `adjustment_factor`. The `adjustment_factor` remains constant for a given `season`, thus any increase in `base_sales` leads directly to an increase in `projected_sales`.",
