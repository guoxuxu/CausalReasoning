  "Explanation": "While an increase in internal temperature often suggests the heater was turned on, which indicates the external temperature might have been below 18, this cannot be confirmed without more information. The temperature increase could also be due to previously lower external temperatures, and the external temperature might have since changed. Thus, internal temperature increasing does not reliably allow us to infer a decrease in external temperature.",
