  "Explanation": "An increase in the adjustment_factor could occur either by reducing the supply or by increasing the demand as both conditions will prevent the execution of the 'if supply > demand' condition where the factor would have been decreased. Therefore, just observing an increase in the adjustment_factor doesn't necessarily imply that the supply was decreased; demand increase could also be the cause.",
