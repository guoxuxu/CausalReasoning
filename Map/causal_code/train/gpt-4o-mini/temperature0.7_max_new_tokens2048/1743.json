  "Problem": "def calculate_prices(base_price, discount, tax_rate):\n    discounted_price = base_price - (base_price * discount)\n    final_price = discounted_price + (discounted_price * tax_rate)\n    return final_price\",\n\nObserving a lower final_price, can we infer that the base_price was definitely lower, assuming discount and tax_rate remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "A lower final_price could result from either a lower base_price or a higher discount. Without knowing the discount change, the decrease in final_price does not necessarily imply a decrease in base_price.",
