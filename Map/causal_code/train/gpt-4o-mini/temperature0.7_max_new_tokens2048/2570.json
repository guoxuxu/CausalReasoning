  "Explanation": "Temperature can be changed by modifying `deltaTemperature` directly in the `updateWeather` method, independent of umbrella use. The umbrella only affects temperature adjustments when it's rainy, and even so, it's not the only way temperature can change. Therefore, observing a change in temperature does not necessarily imply that an umbrella was used.",
