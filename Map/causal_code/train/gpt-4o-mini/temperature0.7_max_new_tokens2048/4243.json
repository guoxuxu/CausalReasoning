  "Explanation": "A higher return value from compute_metrics could be due to either an increase in mean_val (i.e., the sum of values in data is higher) or because the data length just surpassed the significant threshold of 50. It does not necessarily mean that the data length increased, as the data mean could have independently increased.",
