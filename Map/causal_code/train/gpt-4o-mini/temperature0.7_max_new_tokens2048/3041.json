  "Explanation": "Changing someone’s risk category from 'High Risk' to 'Low Risk' may not necessarily mean that they no longer have a chronic disease, as the risk category can also be influenced by factors such as age and the amount of physical activity. An increase in physical activity hours or becoming younger than 50 could also lead to a reduced risk.",
