  "Problem": "def update_sales(price, promotion): \n    if promotion: \n        sales = price * 0.9 * 1.5 \n    else: \n        sales = price * 1.2 \n    return sales\",\n\nIf the 'promotion' is set to True, will sales increase?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the 'promotion' to True applies a discount to the price (multiplied by 0.9) but increases the overall sales multiplier to 1.5. This overall effect is an increase in sales due to the larger multiplier despite the discount.",
