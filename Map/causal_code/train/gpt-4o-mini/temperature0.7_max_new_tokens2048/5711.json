  "Explanation": "In the original code, the base score is adjusted based on the individual's age if they are over 50 years old. Specifically, the score is decreased by 0.75 for each year they are over 50. Hence, increasing the age for someone over 50 directly causes a reduction in the base score, assuming all other variables remain constant.",
