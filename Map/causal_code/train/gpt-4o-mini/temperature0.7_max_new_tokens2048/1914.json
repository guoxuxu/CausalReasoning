  "Explanation": "While 'Rainy' is predicted when humidity is above 80 according to the forecast method, a lower temperature (under 30) can also cause a 'Cloudy' forecast despite high humidity. Therefore, without knowing the temperature, one can't conclusively determine that high humidity was the cause from the 'Rainy' effect alone.",
