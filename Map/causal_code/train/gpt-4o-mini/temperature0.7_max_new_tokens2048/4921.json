  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * demand * tax_rate \n    discounted_price = price - price * discount \n    total_revenue = discounted_price * demand + tax_amount \n    return total_revenue\",\n\nIf we increase 'discount', keeping other factors constant, will 'total_revenue' decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'discount' lowers the 'discounted_price' (price after applying discount), which is used to calculate 'total_revenue'. Despite the same demand and tax amounts, the reduction in the unit price from the increased discount results in lower total sales revenue.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
