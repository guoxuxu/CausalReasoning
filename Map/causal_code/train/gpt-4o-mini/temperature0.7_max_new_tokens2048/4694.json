  "Explanation": "When an increase in 'final_price' is observed post-intervention, and since 'base_price' remained constant, it logically implies that the 'discount' was decreased. This inference is possible because the only other factor that controls the 'final_price' directly in the code's logic, when 'base_price' is constant, is the 'discount'.",
