  "Explanation": "While an increase in `external_temp` does contribute to an increase in `temperature`, there are other independent mechanisms inside the code which might increase the `temperature` such as the heater turning on automatically when the `temperature` is below 20. Therefore, an increase in `temperature` cannot conclusively imply that `external_temp` has increased without additional information.",
