  "Explanation": "An increase in the returned value could be due to an increase in the overall values in the data list (including through interventions like adding 5 to each element) or simply because more high-value elements were included or because the quantity of data crossed the 50-element threshold. It doesn't directly infer that each element was increased uniformly by 5.",
