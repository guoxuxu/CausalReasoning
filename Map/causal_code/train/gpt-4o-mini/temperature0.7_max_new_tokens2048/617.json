  "Explanation": "Without intervention, knowing that it is a holiday directly affects the traffic speed to be 80 km/h as indicated by the if condition `if(isHoliday)` in the `calculateTrafficSpeed()` method. The code sets `trafficSpeed` to 80 km/h whenever `isHoliday` is true, regardless of `trafficDensity`.",
