  "Explanation": "Decreasing stress levels could be caused by any combination of increased exercise, better dietary habits, or beginning to take supplements, or even changes in factors not captured by these variables. Without intervention or additional data, we cannot accurately infer specific changes in these habits just from observing a decrease in stress level.",
