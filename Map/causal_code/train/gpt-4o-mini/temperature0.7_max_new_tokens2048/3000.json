  "Explanation": "Intervening to change both discounts to 15 inherently changes the output for any input of 100 to 85, independent of the initial coupon codes 'SAVE10' or 'SAVE20'. This represents a controlled scenario where the cause (discount) is uniformly applied to see its direct effect on the final price.",
