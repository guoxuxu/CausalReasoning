  "Explanation": "While setting 'condition' to 'A' affects the calculation of 'result', it would add a constant value, not necessarily reversing a decrease in 'result', which also depends on the 'value'. The change in 'result' induced by changing the condition from 'B' to 'A' adds a fixed amount (15) but does not address the underlying 'value' that determines the 'new_value'.",
