  "Explanation": "Turning off the air conditioning results in the elimination of the temperature_reduction of 10, increasing the final_heat_index as this reduction no longer applies, making the heat more strongly felt indoors.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Temperature and humidity together determine the base heat index. High humidity levels lead to an adjustment in the heat index. The effective heat index is calculated based on the base heat index and any adjustments for humidity. If air conditioning is on, it reduces the effective heat index by a specific temperature reduction. Thus, the final heat index is influenced by whether air conditioning is on or off, with the off state leading to a potentially higher final heat index.",
