  "Explanation": "The reset function sets the temperature back to 25 and disables the heating system by setting is_heating_on to False. However, subsequent calls to update_temperature will still change the temperature based on the current external_temp compared to the threshold since the method reset does not interfere with how update_temperature processes its logic.",

  "causal_map_integration": "When the external temperature is below the threshold, the heating is turned on, causing the temperature to increase. Conversely, when the external temperature is above or equal to the threshold, the heating is turned off, leading to a decrease in temperature. Calling the reset method sets the temperature to 25 and turns off the heating, which will affect how temperature changes with external conditions thereafter.",
