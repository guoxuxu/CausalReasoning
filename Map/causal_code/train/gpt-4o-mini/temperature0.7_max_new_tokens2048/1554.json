  "Explanation": "A significantly higher total pay can result from multiple factors including a higher number of completed projects, or exceptions like initially higher base salary or additional motivational bonuses not discussed in the code. An intervention like a base salary increase is only one possible cause and cannot be directly concluded without additional data.",
