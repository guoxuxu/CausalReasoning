  "Explanation": "This question tests the understanding from cause (discount rate) to effect (total sales) without intervention. Since the formula applies a discount based on the rate to the total price of units sold, an increase in discount rate would directly decrease total sales by increasing the discount amount assuming all else remains constant.",
