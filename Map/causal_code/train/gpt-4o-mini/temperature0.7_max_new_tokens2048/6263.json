  "Explanation": "Under normal circumstances, revenue is calculated as the product of price and units sold. Assuming units sold remains constant, an increase in price directly increases revenue.",

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in price leads to a decrease in units sold, which in turn affects the revenue negatively. A higher marketing budget increases units sold, which positively impacts revenue. Additionally, an increase in price directly increases revenue, but the overall effect on revenue depends on the change in units sold.",
