  "Explanation": "Changing the 'evaluation' to 'high' is solely dependent on the 'score' being over 80 and does not affect the 'year' field. The 'year' and 'evaluation' fields are independent in this context under the conditions provided in the code, so intervening to change 'evaluation' does not alter the 'year'.",
