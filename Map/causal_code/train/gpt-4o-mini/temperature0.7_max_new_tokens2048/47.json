  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(balance, rate): \n    interest = balance * rate / 100 \n    return interest \n\nbalance = 5000 \nrate = 5 \ninterest = calculate_interest(balance, rate) \nbalance += interest\",\n\nIf a function is added to regularly update the rate based on external factors, will this change the eventual balance after interest calculation?",
  "Explanation": "By adding a new function that updates the rate based on external factors, which then influences the `interest` outcome through the `calculate_interest` function, this dynamically adjusts the `interest` added to the balance. Consequently, the final `balance` post the interest addition will be altered compared to without this rate adjustment mechanism.",
