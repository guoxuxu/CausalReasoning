  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data):\n    sales = sum(item['sales'] for item in data)\n    losses = sum(item['loss'] for item in data)\n    profit = sales - losses\n    tax = 0.2 * profit if profit > 0 else 0\n    net_profit = profit - tax\n    return {'sales': sales, 'losses': losses, 'profit': profit, 'net_profit': net_profit}\",\n\nIf an intervention is made to fix the tax rate at 0.25 instead of 0.2, and sales remain the same but losses decrease, will this guarantee an increase in net_profit?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the tax rate to 0.25 increases the amount taxed from the profit, however, if the losses decrease while sales remain constant, the overall profit will increase even more significantly. Since the rise in profit from reducing losses outweighs the increase in tax, net_profit will still be higher.",
