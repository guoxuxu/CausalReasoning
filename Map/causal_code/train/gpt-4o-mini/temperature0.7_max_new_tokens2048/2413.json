  "Explanation": "By removing the conditional subtraction from the functionality, the output 'result' becomes solely dependent on the scaled 'warmed_data' value. Since this value is calculated as 0.5 * data * (1.2 + data), which is a monotonically increasing function (all coefficients are positive and increasing with data), increasing 'data_input' directly leads to an increase in 'result'. Thus, making this intervention simplifies the relation and ensures an increase in output with an increase in input.",
