  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 15 degrees means all City objects with a WeatherSystem instantiated at this temperature will default to 'Rainy' according to the defined temperature thresholds in update_weather(). It's a direct intervention on the cause which programmatically sets an outcome, regardless of prior weather conditions.",
