  "Problem": "class ShoppingCart { constructor() { this.items = []; this.total = 0; } addItem(item, price) { this.items.push({item: item, price: price}); this.updateTotal(); } removeItem(itemName) { this.items = this.items.filter(item => item.item !== itemName); this.updateTotal(); } updateTotal() { this.total = this.items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0); } applyDiscount(code) { if (code === 'SAVE10') { this.total *= 0.9; } else if (code === 'SAVE20') { this.total *= 0.8; } } }\",\n\nDoes adding an item to the shopping cart always increase the total price?",
  "Explanation": "The addItem method adds an item to the cart and then calls updateTotal which recalculates the total price by summing up the prices of all items, thereby increasing the total when a new item is added.",
