  "Explanation": "Intervention in the code by altering the addition step from 10 to 20 increases 'adjusted_data'. Given the fixed multiplication step that follows, this alteration will directly cause an increase in 'final_data', and therefore an increase in 'result'. The causal link is direct and stipulated by the procedural flow of the function.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
