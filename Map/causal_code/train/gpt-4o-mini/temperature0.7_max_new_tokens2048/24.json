  "Explanation": "While the enabling of 'apply_correction' does reduce each qualifying data element, the main driver for size reduction in 'filtered_data' when increasing 'filter_threshold' would be the threshold change itself. We cannot definitively conclude reduction in individual data element sizes due to 'apply_correction' alone caused the shorter data list, as it might be primarily due to fewer elements passing the increased threshold.",
