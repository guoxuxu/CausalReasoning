  "Explanation": "Turning on the air purifier without cleaning its dirty filter will not result in good air quality because the `check_air_quality` method confirms that both conditions, `is_on` and `not filter_dirty`, must be true for the air quality to be 'Good'. If the filter remains dirty, the air quality will still be 'Poor'.",
