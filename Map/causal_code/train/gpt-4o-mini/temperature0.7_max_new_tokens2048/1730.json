  "Explanation": "Inside the 'recordSale' method, any time a sale is recorded by invoking 'recordSale', 'totalSales' is incremented by the amount of the sale. Therefore, as the number of transactions increases, the 'totalSales' naturally increases, showing a cause-effect relationship from the number of transactions (cause) to total sales (effect) without any intervention.",
