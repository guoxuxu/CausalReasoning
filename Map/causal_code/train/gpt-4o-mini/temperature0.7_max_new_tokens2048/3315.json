  "Explanation": "While an increase in marketing campaign budget may indeed cause an increase in total sales, there are other independent variables such as economic conditions and seasonal effects that can also influence sales. Without information on these variables, it is not valid to attribute changes in total sales exclusively to changes in the marketing budget.",
