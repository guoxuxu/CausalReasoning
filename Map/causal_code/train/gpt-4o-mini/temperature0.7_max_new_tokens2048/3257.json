  "Explanation": "As 'fever' being true initially is unrelated to the established intervention of manually setting 'body_temperature' to 36.5. This also resets any natural progression of temperature changes influenced by external factors. We can't conclusively trace back the cause of the initial fever to external temperature alone.",
