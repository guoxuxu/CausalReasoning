  "Explanation": "While a significant increase in healthScore among the populace could be due to adherence to a no-smoking policy, it could also result from younger age demographics or other health interventions. The effect (healthScore increase) may arise from various causes, so it's insufficient to determine policy adherence based solely on healthScore.",
