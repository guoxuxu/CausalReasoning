  "Problem": "Function to determine if health improves based on lifestyle changes and medication.\",\n\nIf the health score does not exceed the threshold, does that imply neither lifestyle changes nor medication was applied?",
  "Explanation": "Due to negative variability, the score might not exceed even with one of the factors applied.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
