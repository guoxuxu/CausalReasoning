  "Explanation": "If the final output was unexpectedly high, one plausible explanation could be the modification or replacement of the 'subtract' operation with an 'add'. Since subtraction of a positive number reduces the total and addition increases it, observing a larger than expected output suggests additional or increased addition operations instead of subtraction.",
