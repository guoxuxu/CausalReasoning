  "Explanation": "The useUmbrella being true means that it was either raining and the temperature was below 25, or one of the conditions were met in conjunction with other unrevealed manipulations (like a hardcoded value change). Without direct observation or explicit information about interventions, we cannot conclusively determine it was raining.",
