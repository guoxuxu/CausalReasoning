  "Explanation": "Reducing a patient's weight leads directly to a reduced BMI, given that height remains constant. This drop in BMI could move the patient from a higher to a lower risk category (e.g., from 'High' to 'Moderate' or even to 'Low'), according to the BMI thresholds set in the code under 'health_risk' function.",
