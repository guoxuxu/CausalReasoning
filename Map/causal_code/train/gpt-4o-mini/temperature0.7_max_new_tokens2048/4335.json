  "Explanation": "Setting the passing grade threshold at 70 means that any student scoring 70 or above will pass. Previously, the passing thresholds might have been implicitly higher (as grades A, B, C might have been considered passing in some contexts). Lowering the threshold directly increases the range of scores that are considered as passing, thereby increasing the number of students meeting the passing criteria.",
