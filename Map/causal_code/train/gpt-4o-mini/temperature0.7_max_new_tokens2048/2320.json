  "Explanation": "An increase in the result's 'length' could be due to various reasons such as more non-empty strings in the input `data` itself or changes in other functions like `enrich`. Without knowing more about specific changes to the `clean` function or the nature of the input, this conclusion cannot be definitively drawn.",
