  "Explanation": "If the external temperature drops yet the room temperature remains steady, one plausible explanation given the code's functionality is that the heater was turned on to counteract the cooling effect of the external temperature drop, assuming no other sources of heat and no significant delay in temperature adjustment (intervention to maintain steady room temperature).",
