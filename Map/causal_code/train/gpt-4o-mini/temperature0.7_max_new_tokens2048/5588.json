  "Explanation": "Since the 'weather_status' function's only parameter and determining factor for setting the weather status is temperature (i.e., warm if greater than 20, otherwise cold), observing a 'Cold' weather status directly implies that the temperature was not greater than 20, according to the code logic.",
