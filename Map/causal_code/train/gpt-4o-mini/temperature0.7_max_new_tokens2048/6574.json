  "Explanation": "John Doe's initial sales are 1000, which does not exceed the bonus threshold of 1200. The bonus is only given if sales exceed the threshold, which occurs only after the sales are updated by 300 units making his total 1300. Without the update, he would not meet the threshold hence no bonus.",
