  "Explanation": "In the provided code, when the 'updateWeather' method is called with 'rainy' as an argument, the temperature is explicitly reduced by 5 units. Since this reduction is coded directly into the method, the temperature is guaranteed to decrease whenever the weather is set to 'rainy'.",
