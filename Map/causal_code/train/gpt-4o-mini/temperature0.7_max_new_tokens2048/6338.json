  "Explanation": "Turning off the coffee machine during operation leading to a halt in making coffee demonstrates that the machine's power state (on/off) directly governs its ability to continue functioning and make coffee. This is a clear cause (power state changed to off) to effect (coffee making process halted) case with an intervention (the act of turning off the machine).",
