  "Explanation": "While rain occurring does strongly suggest low temperature, it being below 15 degrees is only a possibility, not a certainty, as rain can start as long as the temperature is below 20 degrees. Hence, we cannot infer with certainty that the temperature must be below 15 degrees just from the rain.",
