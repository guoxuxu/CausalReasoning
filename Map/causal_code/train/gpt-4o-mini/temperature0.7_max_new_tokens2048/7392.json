  "Explanation": "A significant reduction in score can be caused either by lowering the temperature, lowering the humidity, or both. Lowering either variable can reduce the discomfort index significantly, not just humidity. Additionally, lowering the values below their thresholds in the conditional statement can also end the boosted score (1.2 multiplier), thus further lowering the score significantly.",
