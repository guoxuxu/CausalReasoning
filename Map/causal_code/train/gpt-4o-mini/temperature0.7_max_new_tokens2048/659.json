  "Explanation": "Setting 'cold_days_count' to zero manually as an intervention does not affect the original 'data' temperatures directly. The actual temperatures could still be below 10, but have been ignored or not counted due to the intervention. This highlights the limitation in inferring the natural cause from an artificial effect caused by intervention.",
