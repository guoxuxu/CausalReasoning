  "Explanation": "An increase in the output from `predictedRevenue()` could result from either an increase in `pricePerUnit` or `numberOfSales`. Without additional information, it is not definite that the price was increased through the `increasePrice()` method; `numberOfSales` might also have contributed to the rise.",
