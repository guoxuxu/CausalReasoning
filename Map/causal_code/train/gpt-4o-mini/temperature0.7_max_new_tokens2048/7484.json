  "Explanation": "An increase in the predator population could result from various factors, such as a natural increase in prey due to high resources or lower predator death rates not necessarily driven by an intervention. Since the model allows for natural fluctuations in predator and prey populations based on multiple variables, increased predators cannot conclusively imply there was an intentional intervention on the prey.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If resources are greater than 50, then the prey growth rate increases, leading to an increase in the prey population. If the predator population increases, it results in higher consumption of resources, which decreases the available resources. Additionally, a higher predator population leads to a higher death rate for predators unless it is offset by an increase in prey availability.",
