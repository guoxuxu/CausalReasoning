  "Explanation": "Knowing that 'apply_filter' outputs zeros implies some values are below the threshold after normalization. One could alter the 'normalize' method to scale the data differently (e.g., higher scaling factor) or adjust the data prior to normalization to shift all values upwards, ensuring all normalized values surpass the threshold, thus eliminating zeros in 'processed_data'.",
