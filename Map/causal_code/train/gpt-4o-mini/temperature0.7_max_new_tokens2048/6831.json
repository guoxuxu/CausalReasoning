  "Explanation": "An increase in room_temperature can be due to the heating system being activated if it was previously off and the room_temperature was below the thermostat_setting. However, if room_temperature increased, it does not imply that the thermostat_setting was originally low; it could have been that the thermostat_setting was sufficiently high to trigger the heating.",
