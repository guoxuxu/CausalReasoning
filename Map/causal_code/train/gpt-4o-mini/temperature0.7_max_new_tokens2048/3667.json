  "Explanation": "An increase in the total_balance can result from an increase in interest_rate, an increase in account_balance, or the condition for a higher bonus being met. Thus, increasing total_balance alone does not uniquely imply that the interest_rate must have been increased. This reflects the complexity of backward causation without direct intervention.",
