  "Explanation": "Traffic lights being off does not necessarily mean there was an intervention to remove them. According to the class logic, traffic lights will naturally turn off if the car count decreases to 10 or fewer, without requiring manual intervention. Hence, lights being off could also be a natural effect of decreased traffic.",
