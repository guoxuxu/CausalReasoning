  "Explanation": "Although calling setTrafficLightGreen() will make checkIfTrafficIsAllowed() return true, the initial value of isGreen might also be directly manipulated elsewhere in the class, or the light might have been set to green by operateTrafficLight method with true action. Thus, a true result from checkIfTrafficIsAllowed() doesn't definitively imply setTrafficLightGreen() was called.",
