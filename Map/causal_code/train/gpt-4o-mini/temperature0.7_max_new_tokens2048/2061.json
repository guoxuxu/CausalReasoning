  "Explanation": "Since the total sales calculation is directly proportional to the product of prices and units sold, increasing prices will increase the total sales assuming units sold and discounts remain constant.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
