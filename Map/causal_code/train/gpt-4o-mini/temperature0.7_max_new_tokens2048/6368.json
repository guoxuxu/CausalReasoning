  "Explanation": "The method 'sell_item' returns False if either the 'item' does not exist in 'self.stock_levels' or if the available stock level of 'item' is less than the 'quantity' requested to be sold. Therefore, a False return specifically indicates that the 'quantity' could not be met by the current stock, suggesting that the stock was insufficient.",
