  "Problem": "def predict_sales(price, ad_budget, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        base_sales = 120\n    else:\n        base_sales = 100\n    adjusted_price_effect = price * -0.5\n    ad_effect = ad_budget * 0.4\n    total_sales = base_sales + adjusted_price_effect + ad_effect\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf we observe an increase in total_sales, did the season definitely change to 'high'?",
  "Explanation": "While changing the season to 'high' can increase total_sales, other factors like increase in ad_budget or decrease in price also affect total_sales positively. Therefore, an increase in total_sales does not unambiguously indicate a change in season to 'high'.",
