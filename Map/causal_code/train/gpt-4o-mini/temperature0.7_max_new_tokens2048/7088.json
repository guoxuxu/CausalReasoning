  "Explanation": "According to the 'is_flu' method, for a patient to be considered as having the flu, they must both have a fever and a cough intensity over 5. Therefore, if the flu status returns True, it necessarily implies that the patient had a fever to begin with, in addition to a sufficient cough intensity.",
