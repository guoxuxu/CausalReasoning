  "Explanation": "Increasing the minimal exercise frequency, assuming it shifts exercise_freq above 4 for more individuals, leads to more individuals having their health_index computed as weight * 0.6, typically resulting in a lower health index for heavier individuals, demonstrating a clear intervention effect.",
