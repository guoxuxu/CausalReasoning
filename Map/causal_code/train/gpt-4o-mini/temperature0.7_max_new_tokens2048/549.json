  "Problem": "def increment(x): return x + 1\ndef double(x): return x * 2\ndef process_data(x): y = increment(x); z = double(y); return z\",\n\nIf the input value `x` is increased, will the final output of `process_data` function increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing `x` directly influences the output of the `increment` function by increasing its output (`y`). Since `y` is the input for `double`, and `double` multiplies its input by 2, the final output `z` is directly proportional to the input `x`. Thus, an increase in `x` causes an increase in `z` with no intervention.",
