  "Explanation": "If all data elements are positive, the 'filter' will not change the dataset (as it only filters out non-positive numbers). The sums would be the same, except that in the 'no_filter' case it would be multiplied by 0.5, hence, actually, changing from 'no_filter' to 'filter' would typically increase the result unless all data points are zero.",
