  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention - A risk of 0.5 could occur in two scenarios according to the code: a person over 50 without symptoms (0.4 risk from age + 0.0 from symptoms) or a younger person with symptoms (0.2 risk from age + 0.3 from symptoms). Therefore, the presence of symptoms cannot be solely inferred from the risk level.",
