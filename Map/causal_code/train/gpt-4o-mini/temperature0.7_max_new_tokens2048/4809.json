  "Explanation": "Even if the quantity is fixed and interventionally set to a constant value, changes in the price will still affect 'adjusted_price' and subsequently 'total_cost'. Thus, the final_result, which is dependent on the 'total_cost' crossing certain thresholds, will potentially change. The effect of price on the final_result is therefore somewhat independent of the quantity, provided it's non-zero.",
