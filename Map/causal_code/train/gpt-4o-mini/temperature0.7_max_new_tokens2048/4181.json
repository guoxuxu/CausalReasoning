  "Explanation": "'s2' being 0 could happen in multiple scenarios; one is where 'A', 'B', and 'C' are balanced such that 's1' equals 0 or 10, and 'D' is non-positive (making 's2' equal to 's1' minus 10 which can also be 0). 'C' being very high is just one of many possibilities along with specific combinations of 'A' and 'B', or 'D' being non-positive.",
