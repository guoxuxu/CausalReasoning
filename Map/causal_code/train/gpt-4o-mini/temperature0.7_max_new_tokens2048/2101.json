  "Explanation": "The output of determine_clothing() function that gives 'clothing' choice is directly influenced by 'temperature', which itself depends on 'season'. However, multiple seasons can have overlapping temperature ranges (e.g., 'spring' and 'fall' can both lead to choosing a 'jacket'), making it impossible to perfectly back-infer the season from just the clothing without additional context.",
