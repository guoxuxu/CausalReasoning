  "Problem": "def compute_score(temperature, humidity):\n    discomfort_index = 0.81 * temperature + 0.01 * humidity * (0.99 * temperature - 14.3) + 46.3\n    if temperature > 25 and humidity > 60:\n        return discomfort_index * 1.2\n    else:\n        return discomfort_index\n\ntemperature = 27\nhumidity = 65\nscore = compute_score(temperature, humidity)\",\n\nIf the temperature increases, would the discomfort index increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the formula for `discomfort_index`, the temperature contributes positively to the index. An increase in temperature increases the `discomfort_index` through the formula `0.81 * temperature` and `0.01 * humidity * (0.99 * temperature - 14.3)` both of which include positive terms multiplied with the temperature.",
