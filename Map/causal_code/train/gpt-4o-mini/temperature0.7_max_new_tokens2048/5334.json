  "Explanation": "A change in the finalPrice could be attributed to changes in either the base_price or the tax_rate, or both. Without specific knowledge of interventions on the base_price or discounts applied, we cannot definitively conclude that the tax_rate was altered just from a change in finalPrice.",
