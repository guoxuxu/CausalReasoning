  "Explanation": "Even if the age is manually set to 20, the 'is_adult' property on the user object remains unchanged unless the check_adult_status method is explicitly called again to update the 'is_adult' attribute. Therefore, setting the age to 20 alone does not necessarily guarantee that allow_purchase will return 'Allowed'.",
