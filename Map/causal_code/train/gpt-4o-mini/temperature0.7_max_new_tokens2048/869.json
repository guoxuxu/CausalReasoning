  "Explanation": "The final state of temperature being 60 degrees does not reveal the explicit usage of the constructor to set it initially because other methods could change it. However, considering this specific code pattern and no external modification to temperature outside of this class, it is appropriate to infer indirectly that the original setting from the constructor caused the initial setting. Answer should be 'Yes', considering no external interaction.",
