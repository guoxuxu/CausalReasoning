  "Explanation": "Increasing the initial revenue, even with the marketing campaign active, directly results in an increased profit as the profit is the difference between revenue and costs. Since costs remain constant in this scenario and the function increases revenue by 50% aside from any effect from the marketing campaign, the profit definitely increases.",
