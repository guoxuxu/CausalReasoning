  "Explanation": "From the code, while the virus spread rate indeed increases with higher temperatures, the reverse isn't necessarily true. A higher virus spread rate could also occur due to a higher number of confirmed cases independent of temperature changes. We cannot confirm a direct cause from the virus spread rate to the average temperature.",
