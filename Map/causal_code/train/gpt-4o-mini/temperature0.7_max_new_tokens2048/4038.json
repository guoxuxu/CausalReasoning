  "Problem": "def calculate_profit(revenue, costs, tax_rate): \n    profit_before_tax = revenue - costs \n    tax = profit_before_tax * tax_rate \n    profit_after_tax = profit_before_tax - tax \n    return profit_after_tax\",\n\nIf the revenue increases, will the profit_after_tax necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing revenue leads to an increase in profit_before_tax (profit_before_tax = revenue - costs). This in turn leads to more tax (tax = profit_before_tax * tax_rate), but the increase in profit_before_tax will typically outweigh the increase in tax, leading to higher profit_after_tax. Thus, with no other intervention, higher revenue generally causes an increase in profit_after_tax.",
