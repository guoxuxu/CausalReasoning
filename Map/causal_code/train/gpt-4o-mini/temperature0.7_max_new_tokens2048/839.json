  "Explanation": "If 'z' is forced to always be True irrespective of the value of 'y', this modification breaks the conditional dependency between 'y' and 'z'. Hence, changes in 'data' will still affect 'y', but this relationship is obscured by the intervention on 'z'. In this altered scenario, 'z' does not reflect changes in 'y' or 'data', disconnecting the observed effect of 'data' on the implications derived from 'z'.",
