  "Explanation": "While a 'purchase' transaction does decrease stock quantity, stock could also decrease from other unaccounted factors or errors in the system. The code does not handle all possible changes in stock, so we cannot definitively conclude a purchase occurred just from a decrease in stock quantity.",
