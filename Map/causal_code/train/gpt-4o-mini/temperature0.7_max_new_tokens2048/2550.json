  "Explanation": "When 'process_data' yields a significantly higher mean age, it suggests that the dataset has been modified to either remove younger individuals or predominantly include older individuals. Given that the 'clean_data' function's role includes removing individuals under 18, its intervention directly leads to such a demographic shift in the dataset, assuming no other variables have been altered.",
