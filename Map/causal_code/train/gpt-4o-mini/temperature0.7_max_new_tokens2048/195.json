  "Explanation": "When the 'changeDiscount' method is called with a higher discount rate, it iterates over all products and updates their prices using the new, higher discount rate. This will reduce each product’s price, and thus the total price calculated in 'getTotalPrice' will be lower, provided there are no other changes in the product list.",
