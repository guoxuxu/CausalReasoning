  "Problem": "def adjust_sales(sales, holidays, promotion):\n    if holidays > 1:\n        sales *= 1.5\n    if promotion:\n        sales += 20\n    return sales\n\nsales = 100\nholidays = 2\npromotion = True\nadjusted_sales = adjust_sales(sales, holidays, promotion)\",\n\nCan we conclude that the increase in adjusted sales is caused by a promotion when we see adjusted sales increase from the given sales figure?",
  "Explanation": "Increased sales could also be due to the increase in the number of holidays as per the given function which multiplies the initial sales by 1.5 if holidays exceed one, along with the addition due to promotion; both factors contribute to the increase.",
