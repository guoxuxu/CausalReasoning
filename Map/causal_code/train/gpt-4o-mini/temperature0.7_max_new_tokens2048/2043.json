  "Problem": "def calculate_interest(principal, rate, years):\n    if principal < 0 or rate <= 0 or years <= 0:\n        return 'Invalid input'\n    interest = principal * (rate / 100) * years\n    total_amount = principal + interest\n    return total_amount\n\namount = 1000\ndeposit_rate = 5\ninvestment_period = 10\nfinal_amount = calculate_interest(amount, deposit_rate, investment_period)\",\n\nIf we enforce a new policy to increase the 'deposit_rate', will the 'final_amount' necessarily be bigger than before for the same 'investment_period' and 'amount'?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'deposit_rate' through a policy change directly affects the 'interest' calculation in the function 'calculate_interest'. Since 'interest' is part of the formula to compute 'final_amount', its increase due to a higher 'deposit_rate' will yield a higher 'final_amount' given that other factors ('investment_period' and 'amount') remain constant.",
