  "Explanation": "With humidity set to zero, the variable w in the formula would be zero. Therefore, any contribution to the result solely depends on z, which is directly proportional to temperature (either 0.9 or 1.1 times depending on whether temperature is above or below 30). Therefore, an increase in temperature directly increases z, and thus the result.",
