  "Explanation": "The 'self.revenue' field is a derived metric based on the orders placed (contents of 'self.orders). However, altering 'self.revenue' does not intervene or alter the processing of orders or the addition to 'self.orders'. The relationship is unidirectional towards revenue accounting.",
