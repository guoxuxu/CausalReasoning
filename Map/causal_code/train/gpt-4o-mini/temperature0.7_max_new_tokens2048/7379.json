  "Explanation": "By intervening to set 'is_adult' to True, the condition that checks age is bypassed. Given this setup, if 'income' is then set to a value greater than 50000, the 'tax_bracket' would definitely be 'high', because both conditions required to classify it as 'high' are met: 'is_adult' is True, and 'income' is over 50000.",
