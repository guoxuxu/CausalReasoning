  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data):\n    average_price = sum(data['price']) / len(data['price'])\n    total_sales = sum(data['quantity'])\n    if average_price > 100:\n        discount = 0.1\n    else:\n        discount = 0.05\n    final_sales = total_sales * (1 - discount)\n    return final_sales, discount\",\n\nIf `total_sales` is increased by a manual adjustment, will this necessarily increase the `final_sales`?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing `total_sales` directly impacts `final_sales` since `final_sales` calculation is directly dependent on the values of `total_sales` after adjusting for discounts. Thus, more sales directly mean more `final_sales`, independent of the price or discount.",
