  "Explanation": "Calling the 'add_funds' method increases the total funds in the portfolio. Once funds exceed 100000, the 'adjust_risk_profile' method is triggered within 'add_funds', which updates the risk profile to 'High'. This is a direct causal link from the cause (adding funds) to the effect (risk profile change) without intervention.",
