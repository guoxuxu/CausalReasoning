  "Explanation": "In the code, the 'grass_wet' variable is determined to be true if either 'rain' or 'sprinkler' is true. As 'rain' being true directly causes 'grass_wet' to be set to true regardless of the state of 'sprinkler', intervening to set 'rain' as True will ensure 'grass_wet' is also True.",
