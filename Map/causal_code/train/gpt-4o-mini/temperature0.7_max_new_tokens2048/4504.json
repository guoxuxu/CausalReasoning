  "Explanation": "Since the adjusted_temperature is computed directly from the temperature, albeit under certain conditions related to humidity, an increase in adjusted_temperature generally indicates an increase in the original temperature. The effect still directly traces back to changes in the causal factor, barring specific humidity conditions that might obscure this relationship.",
