  "causal_map_integration": "Initial sunlight and initial water levels determine the initial conditions of sunlight and water in the ecosystem. Increasing sunlight and decreasing water levels affect the current sunlight and water. Adequate levels of sunlight and water enable photosynthesis, which directly influences plant growth. A decrease in either sunlight or water can lead to a reduction in plant growth. Thus, increased plant growth suggests that sunlight and water levels were adequate.",
