  "Explanation": "The performance could also be 80000 under a neutral market condition with a typical performance equal to the budget (75000). A performance of 80000 does not uniquely identify the market as 'bad'; it could also be the result of neutral market conditions with no observed changes in performance relative to the budget.",
