  "Explanation": "Changing how 'age' missing values are filled in the 'clean_data' function directly affects the data passed to 'analyze_data', hence influencing the calculated 'average_age'. The calculation of 'average_age' depends directly on the values of 'age' in the dataset, which are modified by how missing values are handled.",
