  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(weather, holiday, discount): \n  if weather == 'sunny':\n    mood = 'happy'\n  else:\n    mood = 'normal'\n  if holiday:\n    free_time = 2\n  else:\n    free_time = 1\n  if discount:\n    spending_power = 1.5\n  else:\n    spending_power = 1\n  sales = (mood == 'happy') * free_time * spending_power\n  return sales\",\n\nIf we provide a discount, will this intervention guarantee higher sales regardless of the weather?",
  "Explanation": "While providing a discount raises spending power which can positively impact sales, the final amount of sales also depends on the weather (affecting the mood) and whether it is a holiday (affecting free time). Thus, higher sales are probable but not guaranteed.",
