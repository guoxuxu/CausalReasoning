  "Explanation": "Invoking 'startRain()' sets 'isRaining' to true. If the temperature is 32 degrees or higher, the 'weatherStatus' method will return 'Raining'. Thus, starting the rain directly increases the likelihood of the weather status reporting 'Raining', assuming the temperature condition is met.",
