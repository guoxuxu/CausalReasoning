  "Explanation": "Although lower productivity is influenced by many factors including higher age, a decrease in productivity alone does not necessarily imply an increase in age, as other factors like stress level also have a significant impact on productivity. Therefore, one cannot determine the cause (age increase) strictly from observing the effect (productivity decrease) without additional information.",
