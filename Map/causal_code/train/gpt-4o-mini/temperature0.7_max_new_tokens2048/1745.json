  "Problem": "def calculate_prices(base_price, discount, tax_rate):\n    discounted_price = base_price - (base_price * discount)\n    final_price = discounted_price + (discounted_price * tax_rate)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final_price decreases, can we infer the tax_rate was reduced, assuming an intervention allows us to keep base_price and discount constant?",
  "Explanation": "Although decreasing the tax_rate might reduce the final_price, the observed decrease in final_price could also potentially result from a higher discount. Without specific information about changes in the discount rate, we cannot conclusively infer that a decrease in tax_rate was the cause.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
