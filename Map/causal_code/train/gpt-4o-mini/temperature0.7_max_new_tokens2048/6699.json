  "Explanation": "A higher final score could be caused by multiple factors such as more points being added or the 'bonus' flag being set to True, not necessarily just modifications to the 'increment' function. Without more specific information, simply observing a higher score does not sufficiently indicate that 'increment' alone was altered.",
