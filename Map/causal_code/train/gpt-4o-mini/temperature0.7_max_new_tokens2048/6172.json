  "Explanation": "The code specifies that the air conditioner ('turn_on_AC') is activated only when the status is 'hot'. The status is set to 'hot' exclusively when the temperature exceeds 30 degrees Celsius. Therefore, if the air conditioner is on, it is because the temperature was above 30 degrees Celsius, indicating a direct causal relationship from the effect (air conditioner on) back to the cause.",
