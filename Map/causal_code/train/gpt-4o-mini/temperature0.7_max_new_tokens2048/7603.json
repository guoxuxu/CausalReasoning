  "Explanation": "Setting a higher desired temperature may reduce the frequency or need of cooling during a heat wave, but it does not entirely prevent the activation of cooling if the external increase (e.g., +10 degrees from a heat wave) still pushes the current temperature above even the higher desired temperature. The thermostat will cool the room to match the set desired level.",
