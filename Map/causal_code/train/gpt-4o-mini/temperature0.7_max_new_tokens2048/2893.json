  "Explanation": "Although lowering the VAT rate is one way to reduce the final price including VAT, it's possible that the reduction could also result from other factors such as increased product discounts or changes in the base price. Without further details on these variables, a reduction in overall price cannot solely be attributed to a reduced VAT rate.",
