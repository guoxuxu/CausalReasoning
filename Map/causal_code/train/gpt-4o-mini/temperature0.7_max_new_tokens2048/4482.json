  "Explanation": "Even though the current calculated temperature is 15 degrees and isRainy is true, indicating it was likely raining since the temperature was adjusted down by 5 degrees (assuming default rainy condition decreases temperature by 5 degrees), we cannot conclusively intervene and claim it was definitely raining during initialization without observing the initial rain input directly.",
