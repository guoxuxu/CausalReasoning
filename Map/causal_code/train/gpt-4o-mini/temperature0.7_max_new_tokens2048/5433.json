  "Explanation": "Setting 'np.mean(data) > 0' to always return false fixes 'adjustment' at -10. This intervention will impact 'adjusted_data' calculation as it uses 'adjustment' in its formula. Thus, 'adjusted_data' values will consistently multiply by -10, significantly altering the outcome based on the direct dependency.",
