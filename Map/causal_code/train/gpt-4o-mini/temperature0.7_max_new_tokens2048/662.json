  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n  if 'age' in data: \n    data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n  if data.get('is_adult'):\n    data['discount'] = 0.2\n  else:\n    data['discount'] = 0\n  if 'purchase_amount' in data:\n    data['final_amount'] = data['purchase_amount'] * (1 - data['discount'])\n  return data\",\n\nIf we intervene and set 'is_adult' to True before running `process_data`, what will be the effect on 'final_amount'?",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'is_adult' to True manually overrides the dependency on 'age'. It causes 'discount' to be set to 0.2, which will result in a 20% discount applied to 'purchase_amount', thus affecting 'final_amount' unless 'purchase_amount' is missing.",
