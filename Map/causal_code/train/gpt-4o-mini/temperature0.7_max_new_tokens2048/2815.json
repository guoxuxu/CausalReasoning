  "Explanation": "The nature of the numbers (positive/negative) affects whether they are retained after processing by filter_positive. This outcome can be traced backward to whether they were doubled or halved (indicating flow through double_values or halve_values respectively), depending on the sign and multiplication/division applied.",
