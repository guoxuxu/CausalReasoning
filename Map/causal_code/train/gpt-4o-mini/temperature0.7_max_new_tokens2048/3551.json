  "Explanation": "Since the output 'result' is a function of the input 'data' scaled up and incremented (result = 2*data + 100), any increase in 'result' implies that 'data' was higher. No other factors affect 'result' in the given code.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
