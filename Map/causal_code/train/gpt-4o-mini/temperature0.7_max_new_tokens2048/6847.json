  "Explanation": "Even though age and smoking status negatively affect health score, a high health score alone doesn't guarantee the person is young or a non-smoker. It only suggests less negative impact from these factors but doesn't provide absolute inference about either one specifically due to potential compensatory factors or initial health score settings.",
