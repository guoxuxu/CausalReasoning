  "Explanation": "Although a change in discountRate will affect the output of calculateDiscountedRevenue, the output can also be affected by changes in weeklySales (either the elements of the list or the size of the list) since these directly impact averageSales, which is used in the revenue calculation. Therefore, a change in revenue does not solely imply a change in discountRate.",
