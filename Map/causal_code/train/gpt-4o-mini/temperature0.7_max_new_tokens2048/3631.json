  "Explanation": "A high mean in the returned statistics from compute_statistics does not necessarily imply that the data had outliers, because outliers are removed if the 'clean' flag is used prior to analysis. The high mean could result either from high-density data within the accepted range or usage of the 'analyze' flag without prior cleaning.",
