  "Problem": "int process(int x, int y) {\n  int a = x + y;\n  int b = a * 2;\n  int c = b - 3;\n  if (c > 10) {\n    return b;\n  } else {\n    return a;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the sum of x and y increases, will the function always return a larger value?",
  "Explanation": "The function return value depends on the conditional statement that compares c with 10. The increase in input sum x + y will increase a and b; however, whether b or a is returned is dependent on whether the value of c (which is derived from b) exceeds 10 or not. If the sum x + y increases but c stays under or equals 10, a is returned, which, while increased, may not necessarily be larger than a previously returned b.",
