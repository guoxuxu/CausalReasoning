  "Explanation": "Since the growth rate decrease can be influenced by low levels of water, light, or nutrients, merely controlling the light levels may not necessarily control the growth rate decrease. Other factors (water and nutrients) could still cause a decrease in growth rate despite optimal lighting.",
