  "Explanation": "Making it rain while adjusting the temperature complicates clear attribution of comfort index changes to just the temperature change. The method 'calculateComfortIndex' processes both the temperature and rain status, in addition to humidity impacts. Hence, a direct intervention like this won't clearly isolate temperature effects from the rain influence in terms of their impact on the comfort index.",
