  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, coupon_code):\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == 'SAVE10':\n        discount = 10\n    elif coupon_code == 'SAVE20':\n        discount = 20\n    total_price = price - discount\n    return total_price\n\ndef main():\n    final_price = calculate_discount(100, 'SAVE10')\n    print('Final price:', final_price)\n\nmain()\",\n\nIf the total_price observed is 80, can we infer the coupon code used was 'SAVE20'?",
  "Explanation": "Given that the initial price was 100 (as seen in the 'main' function). The only scenario under the current function rules where the total_price would be 80 is if a 20-unit discount was applied, which corresponds exclusively to the coupon code 'SAVE20'.",
