  "Problem": "def process_data(data, mode):\n    if mode == 'normalize':\n        max_val = max(data)\n        return [x / max_val for x in data]\n    elif mode == 'standardize':\n        mean_val = sum(data) / len(data)\n        std_dev = (sum((x - mean_val) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)) ** 0.5\n        return [(x - mean_val) / std_dev for x in data]\n    else:\n        return data\",\n\nIf a list of all ones is returned, can we conclude the input data was manipulated to be the same for each element?",
  "Explanation": "Although manipulating all input data values to be the same can result in a list of all ones after normalization, this is not the only scenario resulting in a uniform list. For instance, outputting the original data (mode being neither 'normalize' nor 'standardize') can also return a list of all ones if the original data was already uniform.",
