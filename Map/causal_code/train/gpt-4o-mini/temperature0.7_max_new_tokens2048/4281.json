  "Explanation": "Seeing a 'moderate' weather status could mean the initial scenario had a humidity not far above 70% with a temperature not above 30 degrees. Increasing humidity above 80% does not provide information about the initial state of temperature; the temperature could be low or slightly below 30. The causal path from humidity to temperature is not determined just from an increase in humidity and observing 'moderate' status.",
