  "Problem": "def update_sales(price, promotion): \n    if promotion: \n        sales = price * 0.9 * 1.5 \n    else: \n        sales = price * 1.2 \n    return sales\",\n\nIf the price of the product is reduced through intervention, and a promotion is applied, will this further increase sales?",
  "Explanation": "Reducing the price while applying a promotion will decrease the base amount but still invoke the overall sales increase due to the promotional multiplier (0.9 * 1.5). The lower base price with a higher volume multiplier generally would lead to an increase in sales.",
