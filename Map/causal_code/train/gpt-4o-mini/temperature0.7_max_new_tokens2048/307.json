  "Explanation": "Stopping the engine sets `engine_running` to False. According to the implemented 'accelerate' method, the car needs the engine to be running (engine_running=True) to be able to accelerate or increase speed. Therefore, stopping the engine will indeed prohibit any future potential increase in speed unless it is restarted.",
