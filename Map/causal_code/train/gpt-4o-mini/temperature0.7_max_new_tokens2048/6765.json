  "Explanation": "The density is influenced by pressure in two ways: if pressure > 2, density is 0.5 * pressure; otherwise, density is pressure + 1. There are multiple pressure values that can result in a density of 1.5 (e.g., pressure = 1 or 3 atmospheres). Therefore, observing a density of 1.5 does not allow us to conclusively determine the initial pressure was 1 atmosphere.",
