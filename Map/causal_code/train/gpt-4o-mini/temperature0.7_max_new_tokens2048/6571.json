  "Explanation": "A cloudy day (isCloudy = true) does not imply that the temperature was below 0 prior to calling updateWeather. The weather could have become cloudy due to a past decrease in temperature, but it’s not given that this decrease brought the temperature below 0, only that it reduced from a potentially higher initial value.",
