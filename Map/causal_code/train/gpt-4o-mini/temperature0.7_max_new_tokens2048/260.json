  "Explanation": "If an external method sets the alert to 'Normal', and assuming the method adheres to the conditions defined in update_temperature, this setting corresponds to a temperature between 10 to 30, indicative of a moderate temperature change. Therefore, a direct or consequential moderate change is the most likely scenario.",
