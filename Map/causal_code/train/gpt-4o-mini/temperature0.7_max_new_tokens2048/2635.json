  "Explanation": "High sales performance could be observed due to either an intensive campaign during the holiday season with an adequate budget, a moderate campaign in other seasons with a strong economic condition, or various other combinations of strategy and economic conditions. The code doesn't strictly link high sales only to high budgets in the holiday season.",
