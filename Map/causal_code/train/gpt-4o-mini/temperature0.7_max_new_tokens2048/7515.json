  "Explanation": "The intervention to set the 'flag' variable to false directly triggers the execution of the block where the result is calculated as the difference between the max and min values of the 'data' list (max(data) - min(data)). There’s no additional logic that influences this outcome once the 'flag' is set to false.",
