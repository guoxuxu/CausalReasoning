  "Explanation": "While increasing the numbers in 'data' increases the 'mean', the adjustment subtracted from each data point scales accordingly. This can potentially lead to smaller or similarly scaled 'adjusted_data', and because the transformation applied in 'final_data' includes squaring or taking the absolute value, this does not directly guarantee larger outcomes in 'result'.",
