  "Explanation": "The code applies a 1.1x multiplier to sales when `ad_budget` is below 30,000 and a 1.3x multiplier in a medium season regardless of store rating. Strategic reduction in ad budgets for lower-rated stores would result in a lesser multiplier effect (1.1x) compared to when the budget is above 30,000 (which could yield a 1.2x multiplier), hence reducing the overall potential sales increase.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The store rating directly influences base sales, where a higher rating increases sales. The advertising budget also directly influences base sales, with a higher budget leading to a larger increase in sales. Lastly, the season directly affects base sales, with a medium season yielding a substantial increase compared to lower seasons.",
