  "Explanation": "Changes in the output structure of the `analyze` function do not necessarily imply that there were alterations in the `clean` function. The `analyze` function's output can be modified independently of the `clean` function, such as by changing how data is summarized or presented in the result, without any impact on data cleaning.",
