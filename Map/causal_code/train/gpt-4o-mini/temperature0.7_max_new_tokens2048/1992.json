  "Explanation": "The 'uniform' key being True just indicates that all elements in 'processed_data' are equal, which can happen when all elements in 'raw_data' are identical and thus, equal even after normalization and scaling. It does not directly tell us whether the input data was normalized or not, as normalization will retain the uniform distribution if it existed in the original data.",
