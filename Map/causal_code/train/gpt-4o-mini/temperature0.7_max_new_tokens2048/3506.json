  "Explanation": "An increase in temperature will lead to z being calculated as 0.9 times the temperature if it exceeds 30, which is a decrease in the multiplication factor from 1.1 to 0.9. This change could mean the z might not increase depending on the initial value of temperature relative to 30, thus the result might not necessarily increase.",
