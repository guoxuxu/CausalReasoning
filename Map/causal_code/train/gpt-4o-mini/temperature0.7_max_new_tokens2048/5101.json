  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, customer_type):\n    base_discount = 0.1 if customer_type == 'loyal' else 0\n    seasonal_discount = 0.05 if price > 100 else 0\n    total_discount = base_discount + seasonal_discount\n    discounted_price = price - (price * total_discount)\n    return discounted_price\",\n\nIf we set a promotional season discount for all purchases over $100, will this result in a decrease in the total discounted prices observed?",
  "Explanation": "Setting a promotional season discount for purchases over $100 increases the seasonal discount rate for those transactions, leading to a higher total discount and consequently lower discounted prices for those sales.",
