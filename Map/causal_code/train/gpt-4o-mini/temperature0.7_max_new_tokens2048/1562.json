  "Explanation": "Given that changing the discount rate affects the product's ability to be purchased, it implies that the initial `on_sale` flag must have been True. The `discount_rate` impacts the product price only if `on_sale` is True, indicating that originally the product had to be on sale to apply any discount rate change.",
