  "Problem": "def environment_simulation(temp, policy, energy_demand):\n    if temp > 30:\n        air_quality = 'Poor' if policy == 'Weak' else 'Moderate'\n    else:\n        air_quality = 'Good'\n    power_production = energy_demand * 1.1 if temp < 20 else energy_demand * 0.9\n    return air_quality, power_production\",\n\nIf temperature rises above 30 degrees without changing the policy, does the air quality always deteriorate?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, if temperature is above 30 degrees, air quality becomes 'Poor' if the policy is 'Weak'. If the policy is stronger, air quality lowers but remains 'Moderate', suggesting a deterioration from 'Good' (under 30 degrees, where air quality is 'Good' regardless of policy).",
