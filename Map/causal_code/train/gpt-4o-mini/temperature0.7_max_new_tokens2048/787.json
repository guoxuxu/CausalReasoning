  "Explanation": "While the intervention ensures a 'Sunny' status by keeping it from raining and possibly ensuring temperature is above 20, it doesn't imply that the temperature must reach above 30 degrees. The intervention's effect could be achieved by maintaining any temperature over 20 degrees without rain.",
