  "Explanation": "Observing an increase in 'y_intervened' does indicate the product of the intervention on 'x' and the coefficient (2 in this case) led to a positive number. However, it does not distinctly reveal if the change was because the intervened value was positive, as the noise component (0.1 * np.random.randn(data_size)) could also push the results to exhibit positive values even if the intervened 'x' were non-positive.",
