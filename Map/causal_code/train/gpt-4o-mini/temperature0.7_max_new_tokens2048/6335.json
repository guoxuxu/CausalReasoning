  "Explanation": "Reducing the water level in the CoffeeMachine may drop it below the required threshold (50 units), which is necessary to make a cup of coffee. If the water level is below this, the machine will not make coffee, demonstrating a direct causal relationship between water amount and the ability to make coffee.",
