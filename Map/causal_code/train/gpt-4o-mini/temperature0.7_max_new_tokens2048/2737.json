  "Explanation": "Manipulating the environmental variables ('isRainy' and 'temperature') outside of the regular update mechanism ('updateWeather') to set 'isRainy' to true and 'temperature' to below zero allows the simulation of freezing conditions, thus 'checkFreezing' would then return true. This demonstrates intervention to trace effects back to manipulated causes.",
