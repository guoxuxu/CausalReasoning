  "Explanation": "Calling the makeItRain method forces it to rain regardless of the initial temperature value. Therefore, even if it was not raining due to a previous condition (like low temperature), this intervention makes it independent of the original temperature. The temperature could have been above 5 when makeItRain was called.",
