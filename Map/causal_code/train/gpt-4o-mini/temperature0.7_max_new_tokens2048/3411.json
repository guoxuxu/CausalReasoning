'Healthy' : 'Unhealthy'; } } const myGarden = new Plant(); myGarden.water(); myGarden.soakSun(); myGarden.dayPasses(); const plantStatus = myGarden.getStatus();\",\n\nDoes the plant’s current status as 'Healthy' imply that both 'water()' and 'soakSun()' were called the previous day?",
  "Explanation": "The plant being 'Healthy' (water level >= 10) could result from multiple possible combinations of 'water()' and 'soakSun()' activities, not necessarily both in one day. As long as the total increase in water level (from these two methods) and the decrease (from 'dayPasses()') keep the water level at or above 10, the plant will be 'Healthy'. This illustrates a causal inference from effect (healthy status) to potential causes (watering and sun soaking activities).",
