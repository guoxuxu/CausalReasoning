  "Explanation": "Given the logic in the code, 'z' is set to True only if 'y' is greater than 50. Since 'y' is computed as 'data * 5 + 10', for 'y' to be greater than 50, the 'data' needs to be greater than (50 - 10)/5 = 8. Thus, if 'z' is True, it means 'y' is more than 50, implicating 'data' was definitely more than 8.",
