  "Explanation": "The risk level being 'medium' correlates with having diabetes, but it is not conclusive. A medium risk level can occur in any individual with diabetes according to the code, but another medical condition or an unlisted condition might also set this level, thus no direct causal inference from risk level to diabetes can be made without additional information.",
