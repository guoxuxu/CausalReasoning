  "Explanation": "In the given scenario, the only condition set for using an umbrella is that it is raining, though this is contingent on temperature being below 20 degrees. Therefore, observing more people using umbrellas typically implies it has started raining, but it must be noted that this inference might not always hold true if the temperature is not accounted for.",
