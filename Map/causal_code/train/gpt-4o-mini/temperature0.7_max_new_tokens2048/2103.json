  "Explanation": "If the clothing changes from a 'coat' to 't-shirt', it suggests a significant increase in 'temperature', which typically suggests a seasonal change from a colder season like 'winter' to a warmer one like 'summer'. However, this might not always be the case due to overlapping temperature ranges in seasons like 'spring' and 'fall'. This reflects an intervention based inference.",
