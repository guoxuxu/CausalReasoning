  "Explanation": "The change in weather_condition to 'Hot and Dry' when the temperature is increased above 30 depends on whether the humidity is still 50 or lower. If the humidity is above 50, the weather_condition would be 'Hot and Humid'. Therefore, the effect (weather_condition) does not solely depend on the increase in cause (temperature) without intervention on humidity.",
