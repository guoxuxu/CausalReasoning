  "Explanation": "The function riskOfHeartDisease does not solely depend on the age being over 50. It requires both the conditions, age over 50 and having high blood pressure (hasHighBP set to true), to return true. If the blood pressure is not high, the function will return false, despite the age being over 50.",
