  "Explanation": "Introducing an intervention where 'user_activity' is set to a default value of 50 if it's missing ensures that 'user_activity' always exists. Given the conditional checks, this will result in 'category' being set to 'low' (since 50 is not greater than 100), thereby never resulting in 'unknown'.",
