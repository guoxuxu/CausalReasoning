  "Explanation": "Optionally setting the 'discount_code' to 'SUMMER20' doesn't necessarily imply the customer had a coupon, as code assignments can be manually manipulated or affected by external logic not reflected in the observable 'has_coupon' value. Hence, we cannot reliably backtrack from the discount application to the possession of a real coupon.",
