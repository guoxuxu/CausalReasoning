  "Problem": "def calculate_scores(temperature, adjustment): \n    if temperature > 20: \n        score = 70 \n        if adjustment: \n            score += 15 \n    else: \n        score = 50 \n        if adjustment: \n            score -= 10 \n    return score\",\n\nIf the temperature increases from 19 to 21 without any intervention in adjustment, will the score increase?",
  "Explanation": "When the temperature increases from below 20 to above 20, the conditional in the code shifts from the else block where the score is set at 50 to the if block where it is initially set at 70, therefore increasing the score.",
