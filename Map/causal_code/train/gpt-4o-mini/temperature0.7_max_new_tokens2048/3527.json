  "Problem": "class Car{\n  int speed = 0;\n  boolean engineOn = false;\n  void startEngine() {\n    engineOn = true;\n    speed = 0;\n  }\n  void stopEngine() {\n    engineOn = false;\n    speed = 0;\n  }\n  void accelerate(int increment) {\n    if (engineOn) {\n      speed += increment;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the speed is zero, has the engine necessarily just been turned on?",
  "Explanation": "A speed of zero can occur in multiple scenarios. It happens when the engine is stopped (`stopEngine()` method sets `speed` to zero), when the engine is just turned on (`startEngine()` method also sets `speed` to zero), or if the car was not accelerated after the engine was started. Thus, a zero speed doesn't directly imply that the engine has only just been turned on.",
