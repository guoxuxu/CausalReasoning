  "Explanation": "While the task_type 'calculation' does set memory_used to 'low', the same value 'low' is also possible with task_type 'data_processing' if use_high_memory is False. Therefore, the cause (task_type being 'calculation') is not the only possibility for the observed effect (memory_used 'low').",
