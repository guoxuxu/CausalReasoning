  "Problem": "Python code provided above\",\n\nIf 'results' are empty, can we conclude that the 'insert_data' function was not called?",
  "Explanation": "An empty result could be due to the 'insert_data' function not being called, but it could also be due to other reasons such as database connection issues or incorrect data values that do not match the query criteria.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
