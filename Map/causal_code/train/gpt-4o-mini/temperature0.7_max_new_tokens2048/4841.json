  "Explanation": "Using the irrigation system modifies the temperature (`temperature += 5` if irrigation is on, and `temperature -= 5` if off). This change in temperature can indirectly affect whether it starts raining or stops, as both the `triggerRain` and `setTemperature` methods rely on temperature values to determine rain conditions.",
