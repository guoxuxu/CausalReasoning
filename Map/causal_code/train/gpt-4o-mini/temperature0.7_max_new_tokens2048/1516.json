  "Explanation": "While it’s true that having diabetes sets the risk level at 'Medium' for people under 50 or over 50 with moderate conditions, a risk level of 'Medium' is not exclusively caused by having diabetes as younger people without other conditions might not fall into any higher risk even with diabetes.",
