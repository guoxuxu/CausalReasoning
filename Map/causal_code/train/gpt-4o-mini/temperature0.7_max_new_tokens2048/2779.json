  "Explanation": "Given the conditional logic in `calculate_rain_probability`, an 80% rain probability only occurs when both humidity is above 85% and temperature is above 15°C.",

Additionally, if humidity is greater than 75, the rain probability is set to 50%. If the rain probability is 20%, it indicates that humidity is less than or equal to 75. Updating the weather with new temperature and humidity values causes the rain probability to be recalculated.",
