  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand_factor, discount_applied):\n    base_price = price\n    if discount_applied:\n        price = price * 0.9  # 10% discount\n    demand = demand_factor * price\n    sales = price * demand\n    return sales\",\n\nAssuming 'sales' have decreased, can implementing a discount reverse this trend?",
  "Explanation": "While applying a discount might increase 'demand' by making the price more attractive, it doesn't guarantee an increase in 'sales' as it also lowers the 'price' component. Thus, simply applying a discount may not suffice to reverse a decrease in 'sales' without considering other factors at play such as the 'demand_factor' and underlying 'price'.",
