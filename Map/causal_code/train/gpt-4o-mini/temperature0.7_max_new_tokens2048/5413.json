  "Explanation": "According to the code, when antipyretic medication is taken, the temperature increase due to sickness and high outdoor activity is reduced by 3 degrees. Thus, given that all other conditions (sick and high activity) are held constant, taking the antipyretic medication will result in a lower temperature increase.",
