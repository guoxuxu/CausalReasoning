  "Explanation": "Manually setting the `tax_bracket` to 'high' does not affect the `income` value in the data. The code does not contain any mechanism to back-update or adjust `income` based on `tax_bracket`. The manipulation of `tax_bracket` does not influence the condition checked against `income`. Hence, no automatic update to `income` occurs.",
