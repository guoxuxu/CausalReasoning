  "Explanation": "The method 'getChanceOfRain' returns a higher chance of rain (0.9) when the weather is 'rainy' compared to other weather conditions. Therefore, changing the weather to 'rainy' directly increases the calculated chance of rain, demonstrating the cause (weather changing to 'rainy') leading to the effect (increase in chance of rain).",
