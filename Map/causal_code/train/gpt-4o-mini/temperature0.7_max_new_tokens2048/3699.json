  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"A simple inventory system that manages orders and stock for items. When an order is made for an item, the stock quantity decreases. If the stock goes below a minimum threshold, a restock action is triggered automatically.\",\n    \"code\": \"class InventorySystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stock = {'apple': 50, 'banana': 30}\n        self.min_threshold = {'apple': 10, 'banana': 5}\n\n    def order_item(self, item_name, quantity):\n        if item_name in self.stock:\n            self.stock[item_name] -= quantity\n            if self.stock[item_name] < self.min_threshold[item_name]:\n                self.restock_item(item_name)\n\n    def restock_item(self, item_name):\n        self.stock[item_name] += 100\n\"\n  },\n\nIf we observe that apples have been restocked, can we infer that the stock was below 10 before restocking?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, restocking only occurs when the stock falls below the minimum threshold. The threshold for apples is set at 10. Therefore, if restocking occurs, it implies that the stock was indeed below this level.",
