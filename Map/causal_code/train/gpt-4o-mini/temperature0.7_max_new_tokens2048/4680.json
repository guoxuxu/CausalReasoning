  "Explanation": "Being over the age of 50 can contribute to a higher risk factor, but it isn't the sole contributor. A person could also be in the 'high-risk' category due to being a smoker or having a low activity level. Therefore, the observation of 'high-risk' alone does not necessarily indicate an age above 50.",
