  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  if 'age' in data:\n    data['is_adult'] = data['age'] >= 18\n  if 'salary' in data and data['is_adult']:\n    data['tax_bracket'] = 'high' if data['salary'] > 30000 else 'low'\n  return data\",\n\nIf the 'tax_bracket' is observed to be 'high', and we intervene by setting 'age' to 17, does this imply the 'salary' was initially greater than 30000?",
  "Explanation": "Normally, the only way to set 'tax_bracket' to 'high' is if both 'is_adult' is True and 'salary' is greater than 30000. By intervening and setting 'age' to 17, 'is_adult' cannot be True. Thus, if 'tax_bracket' was 'high' prior to the intervention, it implies 'salary' had to be greater than 30000 even though the status of 'is_adult' was overridden by the intervention.",
