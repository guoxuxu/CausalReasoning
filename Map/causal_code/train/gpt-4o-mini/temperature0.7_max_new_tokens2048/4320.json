  "Explanation": "A decrease in sales could be influenced by multiple factors, such as lower demand or changes in seasonality (moving from high to low season, where season_factor decreases to 0.8) in addition to or instead of reduced advertisement expenses. Therefore, you cannot definitively conclude a reduction in advertisement expenses simply from observing decreased sales.",
