  "Explanation": "Several factors affect 'sales', including 'price', 'demand_increment', 'advertising', and 'season'. Decreased 'sales' could result from lowered 'price', decreased 'demand_increment', a change in season affecting 'seasonal_factor', or advertising changes. Without isolating 'advertising', decreased 'sales' cannot directly imply reduced advertising efforts.",
