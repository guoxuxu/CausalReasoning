  "Explanation": "Changing the 'status' manually to 'minor' suggests that 'is_adult' should logically align with this new status for consistency. Although 'is_adult' is initially derived from 'age', this manual change in 'status' implies that 'is_adult' would have been correspondingly set to False to reflect the new 'status'.",
