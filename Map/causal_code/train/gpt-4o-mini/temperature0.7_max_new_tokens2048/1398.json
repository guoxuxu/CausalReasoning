  "Explanation": "A reduction in total_salary could be due to either a decrease in base_salary or the removal of a bonus, or even a reduction in the bonus_rate. Thus, a decreased total_salary cannot conclusively infer the removal of a bonus without knowing more details about the changes in base_salary or bonus_rate.",
