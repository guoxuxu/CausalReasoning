  "Explanation": "Manual adjustment of `mean_squares` to make it equal to `mean_val**2` means setting the variance (computed as `mean_squares - mean_val**2`) to zero. This intervention directly influences the computation of the variance, reducing it to zero. Hence, there's no change in the variance, it straightforwardly becomes zero due to the adjustment.",
