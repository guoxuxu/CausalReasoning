  "Explanation": "By adding steps to reduce the length of the data in 'clean_data', less data is passed to 'analyze_data'. Consequently, this reduces the likelihood of exceeding the length threshold that triggers the 'Data is too large' outcome. This is an example of inferring from cause to effect with an intervention.",
