  "Explanation": "Just observing a temperature increase does not reliably tell us the initial state of the heater as it could be influenced by any previous ambient temperature conditions. After forcefully setting the heater on, the original state of the heater (whether on or off) does not affect the observed outcome which is dependent on the current state of the heater being on.",
