  "Explanation": "In the given code, every 5th customer added results in a revenue increase of 100. Since customer addition is periodic and not conditional on any discounts or sales events, reaching 20 customers would have incremented the revenue by 100 at least four times - at 5, 10, 15, and 20 customers.",

The addCustomer function directly causes an increase in the customers count. The customerEvent function causes an increase in customers and may apply a discount if conditions are met, but does not independently affect revenue.",
