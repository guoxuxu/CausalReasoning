  "Explanation": "Intervening by fixing the result equal to twice the sum of data matches the condition 'C' exactly. However, it's also possible that twice the sum equals the original sum + 10 (condition 'A') or the original sum - 5 (condition 'B') under special circumstances (specific values of sum). Hence, the effect (result being twice the sum) doesn't exclusively determine the cause (condition).",
