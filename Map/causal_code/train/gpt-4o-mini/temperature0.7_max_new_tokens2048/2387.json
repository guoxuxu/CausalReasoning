  "Explanation": "In the method forecast_temperature, the temperature is calculated as self.temperature + (days_ahead * 2) - (0.1 * self.humidity). Increasing the days_ahead inherently increases the forecast temperature by 2 degrees per day, adhering to a linear relationship with no other variables being changed. Therefore, the answer is yes.",
