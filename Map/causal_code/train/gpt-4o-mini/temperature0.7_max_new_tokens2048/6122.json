  "Explanation": "A higher rate of temperature increase can be influenced by several factors, including but not limited to changes in the code. There could be other alterations or environmental factors affecting the system's thermodynamics. Thus, observing a higher increase alone doesn't conclusively indicate that the heating increment in the code was changed.",
