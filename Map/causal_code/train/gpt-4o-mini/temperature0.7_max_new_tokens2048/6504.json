  "Explanation": "A decrease in the function's output (z) could occur without a decrease in input_data. This could happen if input_data results in a y value slightly over 20, moving from a condition where z = y * 2 to one where z = y - 2 on a slight increase in input_data, thereby reducing z even though input_data increased.",
