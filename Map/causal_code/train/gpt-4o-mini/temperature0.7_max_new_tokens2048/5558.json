  "Explanation": "The increase action applies a multiplication of 1.2 to the input data. Even if an output is observed to be higher than the input, setting the action as 'increase' doesn't provide specific information about the original input value, as any input subjected to this multiplication (if positive and non-zero) would result in an increased output. The actual input value could still be any number.",
