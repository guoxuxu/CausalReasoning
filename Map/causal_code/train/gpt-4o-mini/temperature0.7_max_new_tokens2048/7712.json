  "Problem": "def calculate_score(temperature, humidity):\n    if temperature > 20:\n        comfort = 'High'\n    else:\n        comfort = 'Low'\n    if humidity > 50:\n        feeling = 'Sticky'\n    else:\n        feeling = 'Comfortable'\n    if comfort == 'High' and feeling == 'Comfortable':\n        return 'Enjoyable Day'\n    else:\n        return 'Not Ideal Day'\n\nprint(calculate_score(25, 45))\",\n\nIf we observe the output 'Enjoyable Day' and then set humidity to above 50%, will the temperature necessarily be above 20?",
  "Explanation": "For the output to initially be 'Enjoyable Day', both 'comfort' must be 'High' and 'feeling' must be 'Comfortable'. 'Comfort' being 'High' necessarily means the temperature was above 20. Setting the humidity above 50% only affects the 'feeling' but doesn't change this past condition on the temperature.",
