  "Explanation": "Raising the 'filter_threshold' causes fewer data items to pass the filter, which potentially raises the average of remaining higher values. However, if too high threshold is used, it could significantly reduce the number of data points or exclude high-value items, thereby potentially lowering the 'final_result'.",
