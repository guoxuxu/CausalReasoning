  "Problem": "Above Python code\",\n\nAssuming we observe an increase in internal temperature after manually increasing the heating output, does this suggest there are more people in the building?",
  "Explanation": "The observed increase in temperature after an intervention on the heating system does not imply an increase in occupancy. The correlation between internal temperature and occupancy is overridden by the fact that the temperature was increased by direct intervention on the heating system, making the rise independent of occupancy levels.",
