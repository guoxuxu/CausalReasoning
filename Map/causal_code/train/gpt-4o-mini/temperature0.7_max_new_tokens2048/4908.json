  "Explanation": "The growth rate remains unaffected by changes in the initial population. It is determined solely by the rate passed during construction of the Simulation instance or altered through 'implementPolicyChange'. The 'simulateYear()' function does not modify 'growthRate', it only affects 'initialPopulation'.",
