  "Explanation": "When a higher fixed expense rate is imposed as an intervention in this scenario, expenses increase, which will likely decrease the profit assuming sales remain constant. Due to expenses rising, the denominator in the ROI formula increases, which typically reduces ROI unless accompanied by a significant increase in sales or profit. This question investigates changes in effect (ROI) from an intervention-based cause (change in expense rate).",
