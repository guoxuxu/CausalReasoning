  "Explanation": "An increase in the tax_rate would actually increase the intermediate calculation of final_price (before discount is applied), which is qualitatively opposite to the effect observed (final_price being less than expected). Thus, a lesser final_price might more likely be the result of some other factor such as the base_price being lower or a high initial final_price triggering a discount.",
