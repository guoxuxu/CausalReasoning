  "Explanation": "A decrease in temperature could be caused by the window being opened, which inherently decreases the temperature by 3 degrees, or it could be from turning off the heater or other unspecified environmental impacts. Without more information, we can't strictly conclude that the window was opened just from observing a temperature drop.",
