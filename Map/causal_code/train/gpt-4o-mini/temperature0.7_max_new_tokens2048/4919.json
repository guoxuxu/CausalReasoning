  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, demand, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * demand * tax_rate \n    discounted_price = price - price * discount \n    total_revenue = discounted_price * demand + tax_amount \n    return total_revenue\",\n\nIf the 'demand' increases, will the 'total_revenue' increase without changing any other variables?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'demand' directly increases 'tax_amount' since it is a multiplier in its formula, and it also influences 'total_revenue' which includes 'demand' as a factor in its computation with 'discounted_price'. Thus, 'total_revenue' is naturally expected to increase with higher 'demand', assuming other variables stay stable.",
