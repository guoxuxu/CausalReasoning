  "Explanation": "Adding a constant to all elements of data_list increases the mean approximately by the same constant, thus the adjusted_data remains roughly unaffected while the bound condition on max_min_ratio might still hold true. The modifications in the balanced_data addition (either +5 or +1 still stand), hence, generally, the output values increase.",
