  "Explanation": "After achieving a 70% vaccination rate, the infection rate is at 5%. Introducing a strong variant (strength > 0.5) triggers the condition in `introduce_variant` that increases the infection rate by 50%. This is an example of a cause (introducing a variant) to effect (increased infection rate) with an intervention (variant introduction).",
