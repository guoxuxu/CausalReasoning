  "Explanation": "Service order plays a critical role. If smaller orders are processed first, it might conserve inventory for later orders. Servicing smaller orders first can potentially leave enough inventory for the next order resulting in 'Order fulfilled'. Hence, changing the order sequence acts as an intervention that can modify the outcomes.",
