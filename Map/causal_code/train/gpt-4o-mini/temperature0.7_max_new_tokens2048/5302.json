  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, loyalty_points):\n    if discount > 20:\n        price = price * 0.8  # 20% discount\n    else:\n        price = price * (1 - discount / 100)\n    if loyalty_points > 100:\n        price = price * 0.95  # 5% loyalty bonus\n    return price\",\n\nIf an investigator manipulates the input to always set `discount` at 0%, and observes that the output price is significantly lower compared to running the function with `discount` at 0% under normal conditions, can it be concluded that `loyalty_points` were high in the original operations?",
  "Explanation": "When `discount` is set to 0% through intervention and the output price is still lower than usual, it implies that another factor within the function must be influencing the price reduction. Given the setup of the function, the only other factor that can cause this is high `loyalty_points`. This shows the causal inference from the observed effect (lower price under controlled discount) to the cause (high loyalty points) with intervention eliminating other variables.",
