  "Explanation": "Methods that adjust sales totals or compute averages, like 'calculateAverageSale' or 'applyDiscount', modify 'totalSales' but they do not impact 'numTransactions', which is strictly controlled by 'recordSale'. Without calling 'recordSale' specifically, the 'numTransactions' remains constant. Thus, there is no reverse causality where changing average sales can affect the number of transactions directly.",
