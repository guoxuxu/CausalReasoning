  "Explanation": "Altering the calorie count directly through additional methods such as a bug fix or override does not causally affect the steps count unless it's explicitly designed to link changes in calorie counts to steps. The original code shows that steps and calorie counts are modified independently in their respective methods (`walk` and `eat`).",
