  "Explanation": "Modifying the function to ignore the 'error' key would interrupt the direct relationship between the presence of an 'error' key and the definition of the status as 'failed'. In this modified scenario, adding an 'error' key would no longer affect the status, which would likely default to 'success' if no other conditions are altered.",
