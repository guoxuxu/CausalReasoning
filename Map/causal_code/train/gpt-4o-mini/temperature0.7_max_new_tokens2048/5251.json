  "Explanation": "Without turning on the heating system, the function will adjust the base temperature based on weather (cold = 50, otherwise = 70). The heating adjustment, which adds 20 to the base, does not occur if the heating is not turned on; thus, colder weather alone does not necessarily result in a higher temperature.",
