The net income depends on both the revenue and expenses.\",\n    \"code\": \"def calculate_net_income(revenue, expenses):\n    net_income = revenue - expenses\n    if net_income > 0:\n        print(f'Profit: ${net_income}')\n    else:\n        print(f'Loss: ${net_income}')\nrevenue = 1000\nexpenses = 500\ncalculate_net_income(revenue, expenses)\"\n  },\n\nIf the net income is greater than zero, does this imply revenue was higher than expenses?",
  "Explanation": "The net_income outputs a positive number (profit) whenever the revenue exceeds expenses according to the function implementation.",
