  "Explanation": "Altering the final power state does not provide direct information about the initial temperature. Various combinations of initial temperature settings, increments, decrements, and threshold values could lead to the same power state. Thus, knowing the power state alone doesn't allow definitive conclusions about the initial temperature.",
