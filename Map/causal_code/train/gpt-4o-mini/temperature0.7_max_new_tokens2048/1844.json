  "Explanation": "The 'stop_engine' method explicitly sets 'engine_on' to False and 'speed' to 0. An automatic system that turns off the engine when speed is 0 would be redundant in this scenario because the engine is already turned off by the method itself, thus the intervention does not change the 'engine_on' status post-method call.",
