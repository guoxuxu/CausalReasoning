  "Explanation": "The method `update_temperature` increases the temperature attribute of the instance. If this updated temperature exceeds 30, and the humidity is already over 40, the `apply_heat_index` method would likely return 'High heat index', showing a direct cause (temperature increase) to effect (change in heat index status) relation.",
