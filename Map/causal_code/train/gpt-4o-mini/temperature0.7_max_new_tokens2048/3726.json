  "Explanation": "The profit is calculated as sales minus cost of goods sold and operating expenses, then adjusted by additional investments. Increasing sales, while keeping other factors constant, directly increases gross profit and hence the net profit, implying a direct causal relationship from sales to profit without any intervention needed.",
