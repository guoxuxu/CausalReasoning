  "Explanation": "The average calculation is affected only by the distribution of values in 'processed_data', not directly by their raw magnitudes. The transformation process normalizes data items based on the minimum and maximum of the original data, causing scaled proportionate values to stay the same regardless of increases in the original max value.",
