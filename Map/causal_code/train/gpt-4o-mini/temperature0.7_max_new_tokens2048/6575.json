  "Explanation": "Receiving a bonus implies that John's total sales exceeded the threshold of 1200. This could be achieved with an update of sales by 300 as per the given scenario, but this isn't the only way; any sales update causing the total to exceed 1200 would result in a bonus. Thus, a specific update of 300 is not necessary.",
