  "Explanation": "While updating the hour to 13 causes a temperature decrease making it potentially conducive to rain if the temperature dips below 20, observing non-rainy weather does not conclusively imply that the hour was set to 13, because non-rainy conditions could result from multiple different hours as long as the temperature remains above 20.",
