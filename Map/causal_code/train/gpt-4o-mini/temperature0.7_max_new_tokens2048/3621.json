  "Explanation": "Lowering cholesterol would reduce the health risk by decreasing the contribution from high cholesterol (a reduction of 1.5 if cholesterol was above 200). However, since smoking and age both significantly contribute to the health risk, reduction in cholesterol does not conclusively indicate that the remaining high risk is primarily due to smoking rather than age.",
