  "Explanation": "Several reasons could lead to a decrease in 'final_data', not exclusively a reduction in 'factor'. The original elements in 'data' could be smaller or negative, or 'offset' could have been changed. Without controlling other variables, we cannot confirm the cause solely based on the reduction in 'final_data'.",
