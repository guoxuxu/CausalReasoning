  "Explanation": "Because the \\'enhance_features\\' function is part of the pipeline in the \\'process_data\\' function, a bug in \\'enhance_features\\' would impact the data being fed into \\'prepare_model_input\\' and consequently the \\'run_model\\', affecting the final predictions returned by \\'process_data\\'.",
