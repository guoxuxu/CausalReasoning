  "Explanation": "Although an increase in pollution level can reduce the growth rate of the plant, a decrease in growth rate might also be influenced by other factors in the environment, such as changes in water or sunlight. Therefore, observation of a decrease in growth rate alone does not solely indicate that pollution levels have increased.",
