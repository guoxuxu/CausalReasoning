  "Explanation": "The 'tax_bracket' being defined depends not only on the 'age' being greater than 18 (which sets 'adult' to True), but also on 'income' being present and its value. Without 'income' data, or if income does not exceed 30000, even if the person is an adult, the 'tax_bracket' cannot be determined as 'high' or 'low'.",
