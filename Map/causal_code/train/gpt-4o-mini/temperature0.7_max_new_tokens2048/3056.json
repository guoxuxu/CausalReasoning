  "Explanation": "Directly modifying the 'funds' attribute does not trigger the 'adjust_risk_profile' method. That method is only called automatically within the 'add_funds' method. Manual direct changes to 'funds' require an explicit call to 'adjust_risk_profile' or another method that triggers it.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial investment contributes to the total funds available in the portfolio. Adding funds increases the total funds, which may affect the risk profile. When the funds exceed 100,000, the risk profile is updated to 'High'. Making an investment decreases the funds available, which can influence the investment success, but does not directly affect the risk profile unless it changes the funds in relation to the 100,000 threshold.",
