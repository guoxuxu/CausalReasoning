  "Explanation": "A total observed to be less than the sum of item prices after `calculate_total` implies a reduction, possibly from `apply_discount_code` method or the quantity discount in `calculate_total`. In this case, considering `SAVE20` was applied correctly, it can be deduced the discount code intervention was successful.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
