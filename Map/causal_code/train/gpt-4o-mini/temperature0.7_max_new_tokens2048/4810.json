  "Explanation": "Setting the final_result to 'Medium' ensures 'total_cost' is between 500 and 1000. However, without knowing the specific intervention details or the original conditions before setting it to 'Medium', we cannot infer exact values for 'price' or 'quantity'. The 'total_cost' could be achieved by various combinations of 'price' and 'quantity'.",
