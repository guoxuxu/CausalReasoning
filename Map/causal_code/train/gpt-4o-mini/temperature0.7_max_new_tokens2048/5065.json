  "Explanation": "The method adjust_satisfaction only reduces the customer satisfaction by 1 when the number sold is less than or equal to 5, compared to a decrease of 2 for more than 5 bikes. So, limiting sales to 5 bikes or fewer per transaction could help in making the decreases in satisfaction less severe, thus helping maintain or potentially improve satisfaction.",
