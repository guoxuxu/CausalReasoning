  "Explanation": "A reduced health_index can result from multiple factors according to the code: being older than 50 with a poor diet or just having a higher weight with lower or no specified conditions on exercise or diet. Exercise frequency directly affects the health index (weight * 0.6) only if it's greater than 4, hence lower health_index does not directly indicate less exercise frequency without further specific information on age or diet.",
