  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: If the final_score remains unchanged despite increasing the score_multiplier, it implies that other parameters must have changed in a way that exactly offsets the effect of the increased score_multiplier. Possible changes include decreasing the base_score, adding a bonus becoming ineffective, or an increase in penalty.",
