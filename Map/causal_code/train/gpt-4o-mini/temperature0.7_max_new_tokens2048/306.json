  "Explanation": "A decrease in speed does not necessarily indicate a deliberate deceleration command by the driver. It might be because the speed was set to a lower value post-deceleration, or speed reaches zero due to a high deceleration value in relation to the current speed, but it's not mandated that this reduction is always due to a deceleration command.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Having fuel level greater than zero causes the engine to run. When the engine is running, it allows the speed of the car to increase. If the fuel level is sufficient, the speed increases at a normal rate; otherwise, it increases at half rate. A speed greater than the decrease allows the speed to decrease, while a speed less than or equal to the decrease results in the speed being set to zero.",
