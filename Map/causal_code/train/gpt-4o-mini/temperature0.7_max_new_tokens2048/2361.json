  "Explanation": "An increase in the humidity reading could lead to a weather prediction change from 'Sunny' to 'Rain', given that temperature is over 30. Since 'Sunny' requires both conditions to be 30 or less and 70% or less, the increase in humidity may push this over the 70% threshold required for 'Rain'. Thus, if the weather changed to 'Rain', the temperature must indeed be above 30.",
