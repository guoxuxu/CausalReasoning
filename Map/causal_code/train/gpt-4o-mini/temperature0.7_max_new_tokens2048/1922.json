  "Explanation": "While a significant increase in total sales might suggest more purchases or higher value purchases, it is not a definitive indication of more high-value purchases specifically. Sales could also increase due to a larger number of smaller-value transactions or prolonged periods of the discount being active, not necessarily just from high-value purchases.",
