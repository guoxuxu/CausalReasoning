  "Explanation": "The scenario describes a causation from a high initial temperature to rainy weather, without intervention. The simulator increases the temperature and sets the weather to rainy only if the increased temperature exceeds 25. Just having a high initial temperature itself does not directly cause rain unless it exceeds 25 through increaseTemperature method, which isn't specified as being called directly in the question.",
