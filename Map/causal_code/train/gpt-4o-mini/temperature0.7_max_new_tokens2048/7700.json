  "Explanation": "Sales reduction might be due to manipulating the 'sales' variable directly in the code rather than being an indicator of decreased store hours or advertising budget. Without explicitly knowing that sales were not directly adjusted, we cannot use a reduction in sales to infer reductions in these variables.",
