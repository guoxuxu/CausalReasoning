  "Explanation": "Given the 'adjusted_value' formula as `value * scale_factor`, and knowing 'value' was 100, an 'adjusted_value' of 300 directly implies that the 'scale_factor' used had to be 3. This deduction is a straightforward calculation invoking the effect (adjusted_value = 300) to backtrack to the cause (scale_factor).",
