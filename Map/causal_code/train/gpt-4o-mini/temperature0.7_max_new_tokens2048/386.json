  "Explanation": "Although the temperature decreases when the weather changes to 'rainy', it's not valid to conclude that the previous state was necessarily 'sunny'. The temperature can decrease from any previous state whenever the weather changes to 'rainy' according to the 'updateWeather' method.",
