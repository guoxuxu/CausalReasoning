  "Problem": "[\n    \"def calculate_discount(items, coupon):\",\n    \"    discount = 0\",\n    \"    if coupon == 'SAVE10':\",\n    \"        discount = 0.1\",\n    \"    total_price = sum(item['price'] for item in items)\",\n    \"    if total_price > 100:\",\n    \"        discount += 0.05\",\n    \"    return total_price * (1 - discount)\"\n  ],\n\nDoes a high total price indicate a coupon was used?",
  "Explanation": "The code increases the discount based on the total price exceeding $100 and this is independent of coupon usage. Coupon usage and total price exceeding are independent, thus a high total price doesn't necessarily mean a coupon was used.",
