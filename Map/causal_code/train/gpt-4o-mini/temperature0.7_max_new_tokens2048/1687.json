  "Problem": "def compute_sales(discount, quantity, base_price):\n\\tif discount > 0:\n\\t\\tfinal_price = base_price * (1 - discount / 100)\n\\telse:\n\\t\\tfinal_price = base_price\n\\ttotal_sales = final_price * quantity\n\\tsurplus = total_sales * 0.05\n\\treturn total_sales, surplus\n\nsales, extra = compute_sales(10, 50, 20)\",\n\nIf the discount increases, will the total sales decrease?",
  "Explanation": "While increasing the discount decreases the unit price, the decrease in unit price might be offset by increased quantity sold due to the more attractive price, leading to stable or even increased total sales. The question assumes a simple negative dependency without considering the potential increase in sales volume.",
