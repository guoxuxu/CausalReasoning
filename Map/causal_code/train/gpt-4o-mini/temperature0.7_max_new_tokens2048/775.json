  "Explanation": "Artificially intervening to set 'is_raining' to False, according to the code, implies that cloud coverage must be 50% or below; this manipulation directly affects the interpretation of the cloud coverage, demonstrating causality from an effect manipulated through intervention back to its cause.",
