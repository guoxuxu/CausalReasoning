  "Problem": "def update_scores(scores, action, delta):\n    if action == 'add':\n        for i in range(len(scores)):\n            scores[i] += delta\n    elif action == 'multiply':\n        for i in range(len(scores)):\n            scores[i] *= delta\n    return scores\n\nscores_list = [10, 20, 30]\nupdate_scores(scores_list, 'add', 5)\nupdate_scores(scores_list, 'multiply', 2)\",\n\nIf the final values of `scores_list` are observed to be higher, can it be inferred that the initial values must have been higher without knowing the specific actions taken?",
  "Explanation": "The final values being higher is not solely dependent on the initial values being higher because the actions ('add' or 'multiply') and the values of `delta` directly affect the scores. Without knowing the actions or delta changes, one cannot infer that higher final scores necessarily result from higher initial scores.",
