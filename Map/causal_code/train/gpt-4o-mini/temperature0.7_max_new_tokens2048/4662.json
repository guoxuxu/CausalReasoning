  "Explanation": "The decrease in total sales after applying a discount does not confirm that the original sales_data prices were unchanged prior to the discount. The decrease is a direct result of the discount application, which reduces every sales data entry, thus reducing the total_sales irrespective of the state of the original prices.",
