  "Explanation": "Initially, buying for $120 earns the customer 10 points. With the additional birthday bonus of 20 points, the total points become 30. Assuming the bonus is given before the purchase, they accumulate past instances to a total of 30, still not enough without considering accumulated points or repeated $120 purchases in the calculation.",
