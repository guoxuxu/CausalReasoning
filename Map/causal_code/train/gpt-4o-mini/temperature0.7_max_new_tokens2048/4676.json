  "Explanation": "A decrease in new infections could be caused by multiple factors such as increased vaccination rates, more effective social distancing, or other variables not mentioned in the code. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated that a decrease in new infections implies an increase in mask wearing without considering other factors.",
