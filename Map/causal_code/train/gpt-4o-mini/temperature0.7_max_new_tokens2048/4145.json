  "Explanation": "An increase in sales after applying a strategy does not conclusively indicate that the strategy itself was wholly effective for all customer segments. Other factors such as changes in the market, economic factors, or even random chance could also contribute to the sales increase. Different customer segments might also respond differently to the same strategy.",
