  "Explanation": "In the code, result is calculated by multiplying inputA and inputB using the multiply function, and then adding inputA to the product in the add function. Increasing inputA will directly increase the multiplication result and also increase the operand in the subsequent addition. Therefore, as inputA increases while inputB remains constant, result will also increase.",
