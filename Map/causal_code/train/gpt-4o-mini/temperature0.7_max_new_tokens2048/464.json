  "Explanation": "A significantly lower final price can be due to a higher discount, which may suggest it is either winter or that there was an intervention (e.g., a special promotion), or due to a lower initial product price itself. Thus, observing a lower price does not necessarily pinpoint the season as winter without more information about potential discounts or the original price.",
