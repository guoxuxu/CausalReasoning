  "Explanation": "Introducing a deduction function that applies a consistent reduction and observing a consequent decrease in 'final_total' suggests the deduction function is causative in lowering the 'final_total'. Given no other changes and the direct application effects of this function, it's reasonable to attribute the change to this intervention.",
