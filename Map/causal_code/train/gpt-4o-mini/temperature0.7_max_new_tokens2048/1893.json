  "Explanation": "Increasing the input value directly increases 'x'. Since 'y' is calculated as 'x' multiplied by 3, an increase in 'x' also increases 'y'. The condition checks if 'y' is greater than 20 to return True; hence, increasing the input increases the chances of this condition being met.",
