  "Explanation": "With an intervention that sets the adjusted_temperature to a higher value, ensuring that the sensor_value is above 100 is necessary because the formula adds an additional 5 only in the range above 100. This is the only case in the function logic that adds a constant value (5), which can result in a significantly higher adjusted_temperature when combined with the multiplication of 1.05.",
