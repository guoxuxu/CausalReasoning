  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    scaled_data = data * 10\n    result = scaled_data + 5\n    return result\n\ndata = 3\noutput = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf we manually set 'scaled_data' to a higher value inside the function, will 'output' increase?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening to set 'scaled_data' to a higher value inside 'process_data' function bypasses the multiplication operation on 'data' and directly increases 'result' by adding 5 to the new 'scaled_data' value. This results in a higher 'output'.",
