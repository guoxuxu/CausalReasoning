  "Explanation": "When the `heater_override` is set to True, the `heater_on` status is forced to True irrespective of the actual temperature. As a result, the code explicitly increases the `temperature` by 3 (`self.temperature += 3`), leading to a guaranteed rise in `temperature` due to the heater being on.",
