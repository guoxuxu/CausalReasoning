  "Explanation": "Limiting the distance of trips directly reduces the amount of fuel required for each trip. Consequently, this intervention will lead to an increase in remaining fuel after the trips, allowing the vehicle to potentially make more trips or travel longer cumulatively before the next refuel.",
