  "Explanation": "Although administering a vaccine can decrease the number of infected patients, a decrease in infected_patients might also result from other factors such as a natural decrease in infection_rate or other interventions. Therefore, a decrease in infected_patients doesn't necessarily mean that a high vaccination rate was administered.",
