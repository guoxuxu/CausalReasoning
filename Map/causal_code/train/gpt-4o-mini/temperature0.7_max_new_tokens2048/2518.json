  "Explanation": "Even though setting 'user_score' to 70 would result in a 'status' of 'high', achieving a 'high' status does not imply that the 'user_score' was exactly 70 before changing. The original 'user_score' could have been any number that, once 10 is added, results in a score higher than 75.",
