  "Problem": "def calculate_health_effects(smoking, exercise_hours, diet_quality):\n    lung_health = 100 - (20 * smoking) + (10 * exercise_hours)\n    obesity_risk = diet_quality * 30 - exercise_hours * 10\n    cancer_risk = 50 + (25 * smoking) - (5 * diet_quality)\n    return lung_health, obesity_risk, cancer_risk\",\n\nIf we encourage a person to exercise more, while keeping their diet quality constant, is it likely that their obesity risk will decrease?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, increasing exercise hours decreases the `obesity_risk` directly (10 units decrease for each hour of exercise) while diet quality remains unchanged. Hence, intervention by increasing exercise directly leads to a reduction in obesity risk.",
