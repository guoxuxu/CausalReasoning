  "Explanation": "While providing a substantial amount of water to certain plants (other than Cactus) can increase the growth rate, other factors such as low pollution levels or high sunlight can also contribute to an increase in growth rate. Therefore, an increased growth rate alone does not confirm that the plant received considerable amounts of water.",
