  "Explanation": "The method `update_weather` changes the values of `temperature` and `humidity`, which are directly used in the conditional logic of `is_rainy()` to determine if it is rainy. Therefore, updating these values impacts the outcome of the `is_rainy()` method, demonstrating a cause to effect relationship without intervention.",
