  "Explanation": "According to the `risk_of_heatstroke` method, a 'High' or 'Moderate' risk is only returned for temperatures of 90 degrees or higher. Therefore, observing a high risk of heatstroke suggests that the temperature was high, although high humidity also plays a role with 'High' risk categorization.",
