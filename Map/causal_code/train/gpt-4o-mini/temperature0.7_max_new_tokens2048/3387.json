  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.9\n        else:\n            return price\n    elif season == 'winter':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.8\n        else:\n            return price * 1.1\n    else:\n        return price\",\n\nIf the returned sales price is equal to the original price, can we infer that no discount was applied?",
  "Explanation": "This inference is incorrect because during the 'summer' season, the price remains the same regardless of whether a discount is applied.",
