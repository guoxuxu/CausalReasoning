  "Explanation": "Manually increasing humidity does not affect temperature directly. If the humidity increases without changing other factors, only the conditions internal to the startRain method (like decrease of temperature on high humidity) may trigger; this does not suggest a heat wave as simulateHeatWave raises both temperature and reduces humidity.",
