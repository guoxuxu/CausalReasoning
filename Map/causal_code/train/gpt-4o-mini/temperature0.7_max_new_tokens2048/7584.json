  "Explanation": "While an increase in daily fruit consumption improves health scores, significant improvement in health scores could also result from other changes like beginning to exercise or aging individuals being fewer. Without specific information that only fruit consumption has changed, it cannot be concluded that a fruit program was implemented.",
