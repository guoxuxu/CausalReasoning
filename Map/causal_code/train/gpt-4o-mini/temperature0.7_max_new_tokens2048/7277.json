  "Explanation": "The method 'addSubscriptions' adds new subscriptions and then immediately calls 'updateSales', which recalculates total sales based on the new number of subscriptions and the current price per subscription. Therefore, with no other changes, increasing the number of new subscriptions directly leads to an increase in total sales.",
