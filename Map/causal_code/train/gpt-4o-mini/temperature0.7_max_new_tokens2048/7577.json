  "Problem": "def compute_values(temp, pressure):\n    boiling_point = 100 + (pressure - 1) * 0.5\n    if temp > boiling_point:\n        state = 'Gas'\n    elif temp == boiling_point:\n        state = 'Transition'\n    else:\n        state = 'Liquid'\n    return state\",\n\nIf the temperature is increased and all else remains constant, will the state always be 'Gas'?",
  "Explanation": "The state depends on both temperature and its comparison to the boiling point. The boiling point is influenced by pressure, thus changing temperature alone doesn't guarantee that the state will always be 'Gas' unless it's above the boiling point regardless of the pressure.",
