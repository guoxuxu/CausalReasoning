  "Explanation": "Increasing the initial inventory does not necessarily mean an increase in predicted sales since the sales rate and marketing impacts also determine the predicted sales. The predicted sales is adjusted based on sales rate and marketing impacts, along with initial inventory. Hence, an increase in inventory does not directly correlate to an increase in predicted sales without considering other factors.",
