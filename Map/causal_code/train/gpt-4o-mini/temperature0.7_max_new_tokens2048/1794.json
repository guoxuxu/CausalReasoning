  "Explanation": "By increasing all sales amounts via the 'Increase Prices' strategy, all records' 'amount' will still be positive if they were positive initially. Since the check for 'Profit' is if all amounts are positive, and none of them turn negative by increasing, 'Profit' will be returned.",
