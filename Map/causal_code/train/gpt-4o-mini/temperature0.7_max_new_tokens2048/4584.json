  "Explanation": "Since `clean_data` filters out all odd numbers, and `analyze_data` computes the average of the remaining numbers, a lower than expected result from `process_data` would often imply that the input data consisted primarily of low, even numbers or did not contain enough high even numbers to raise the average significantly.",
