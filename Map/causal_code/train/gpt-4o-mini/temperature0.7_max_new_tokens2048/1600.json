  "Explanation": "This question examines from effect (total sales) to cause (discount rate) without intervention. While decreasing the discount rate could theoretically lead to an increase in total sales, the increase in total sales could also be due to increased units sold or price per unit, not necessarily a decrease in discount rate. Therefore, a direct causal inference cannot be established without additional information.",
