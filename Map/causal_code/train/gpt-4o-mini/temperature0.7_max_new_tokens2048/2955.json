  "Explanation": "Poor sales performance could occur not only from low market conditions but also from moderate market conditions with a lower than required budget. Hence, observing poor performance alone cannot conclusively determine the market condition was low, as market condition 'Moderate' with less than 80000 budget (which is possible) can also result in 'Poor' performance.",
