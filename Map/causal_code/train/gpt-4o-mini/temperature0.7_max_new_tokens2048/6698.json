  "Explanation": "Modifying the 'increment' function to return x + 2 would increase the amount each call to 'increment' increases the score by 1. Since 'increment' is used in 'update_score' after adjusting the points (including doubling if a bonus is applied), this modification leads directly to a higher final score.",
