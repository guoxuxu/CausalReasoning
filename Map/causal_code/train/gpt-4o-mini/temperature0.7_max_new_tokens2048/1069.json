  "Explanation": "An increase in 'd' could result from several factors due to the dependencies in the function: an increase in 'a' or 'b', or a favorable change in 'x' (e.g., a larger positive value). Without specific information on 'b' and 'x', one cannot conclusively deduce that an increase in 'a' is the sole or direct cause for the increase in 'd'.",
