  "Explanation": "To ensure the 'status' is 'normal', the temperature needs to be adjusted to be 30 or below after processing. Thus, if the original temperature is set below or equal to 20 (which becomes at most 30 after adding 10), the 'status' will consequently be set to 'normal' as specified in the else block of the code.",
