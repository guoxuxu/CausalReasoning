  "Explanation": "Manually turning off the heater does not decrease the room temperature directly through the provided methods. The decreaseTemperature() method reduces the temperature independent of the heater status, relying only on whether the current temperature is above 5°C. Hence, turning off the heater does not affect the temperature unless the decreaseTemperature() method is separately called.",
