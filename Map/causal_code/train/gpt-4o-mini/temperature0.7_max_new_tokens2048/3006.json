  "Explanation": "The `risk_factor` is directly calculated using the `age` column (multiplied by 0.2). Since `age` values are imputed and possibly altered in the `clean` function, any changes to `age` would directly influence the resulting `risk_factor` values calculated later in the analysis pipeline.",
