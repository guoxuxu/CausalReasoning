  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, demand, tax_rate):\n    tax = price * demand * tax_rate\n    final_sales = price * demand + tax\n    return final_sales\",\n\nObserving an increase in final_sales, can we deduce that demand must have increased if we don’t know anything about changes in price or tax_rate?",
  "Explanation": "The increase in final_sales could be due to an increase in either price or demand, or a reduction in tax_rate, or a combination of these factors. Since the code shows final_sales is dependent on multiple variables (price, demand, tax_rate), an increase in final_sales cannot conclusively imply an increase in demand without additional information about the other variables.",
