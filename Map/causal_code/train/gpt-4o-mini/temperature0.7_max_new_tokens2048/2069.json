  "Explanation": "The recording of a temperature below 15 degrees alone does not guarantee rain. It must also be currently raining per the updateWeather conditions for it to keep raining.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If the new rain status is true, it causes isRaining to be true. If the new temperature is lower than 15 degrees, it also causes isRaining to be true. The combination of isRaining being true and the temperature being below 20 causes willItRain to be true. Using a heater causes the temperature to increase by 5 degrees. A true new rain status also affects the temperature, making it potentially lower than the usual minimum of 20 degrees.",
