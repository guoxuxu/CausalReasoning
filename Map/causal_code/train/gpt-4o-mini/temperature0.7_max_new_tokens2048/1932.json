  "Explanation": "shouldBringUmbrella() returns false if either it is not raining or the temperature is 25 or above. If we set the temperature to 30 after observing a false return value, it does not isolate the cause to lack of rain as the method could initially return false due to a high temperature. Thus, intervention on temperature alone after observing the effect does not identify the initial state of rain.",
