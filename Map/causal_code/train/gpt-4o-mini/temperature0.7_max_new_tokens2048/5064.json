  "Explanation": "While selling a large number of bikes can decrease satisfaction, a decrease in satisfaction can also occur with smaller sales (a reduction by 1 for sales of 5 or less). Moreover, external factors or other unmodeled reasons might influence a decrease in satisfaction, providing insufficient evidence that only large sales led to the observed outcome.",
