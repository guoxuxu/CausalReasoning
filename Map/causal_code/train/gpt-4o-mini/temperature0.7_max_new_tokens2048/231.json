Will this change cause an increase in the final value of result?",
  "Explanation": "Altering the code to always add a constant value to inputA inside the processInputs function will increase both the product of the multiplication operation in multiply(a, b) – since inputA has an increased value – and the sum in the add function. Consequently, the modification leads directly to an increase in result.",
