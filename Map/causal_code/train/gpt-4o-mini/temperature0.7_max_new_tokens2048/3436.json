  "Explanation": "Manually reducing the temperature would affect the method rain, as rain decreases temperature further if humidity is above 70. However, reducing temperature would not influence the heat_wave method's threshold condition (temperature > 30) to decrease humidity, as it is purely dependent on the initial state of temperature.",
