  "Explanation": "The response 'Data is too large' from 'process_data' is determined by the length of the data post-cleaning and has no direct relation to whether initial data contained errors. The result 'Data is too large' originates from the condition in 'analyze_data', not the error presence checked earlier. This indicates a test from effect to cause without a causative link.",
