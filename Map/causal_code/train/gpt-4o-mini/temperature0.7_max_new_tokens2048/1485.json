  "Explanation": "When the advertising expense is less than or equal to 40, the increment to sales due to advertising is not applied according to the given logic in the code. Increasing the advertising expense in this situation will not effectively increase the sales because there’s a need to cross the threshold of 40 to have an effect on sales.",
