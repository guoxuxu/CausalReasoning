  "Explanation": "Rain is only caused by the temperature being below 20. As the temperature decreases only when the hour updates past 12 (i.e., temperature -= 5), which then can lead to temperatures that potentially cause rain, noticing it's rainy indirectly implies that the hour was set past 12.",
