  "Explanation": "The decrease in size doesn't necessarily indicate that no datum was greater than 3.33; it could be that all original data were marginally below or exactly at 3.33, since tripling such values might have started producing results that are much larger, skipping numbers barely above 10, which could have been included originally.",
