  "Explanation": "A higher output from 'predict_sales' can result from either a high 'ad_spend' or higher 'base_sales', or both. It's not deterministic to conclude unequivocally about the state of 'ad_spend' above 1000 simply by observing the sales output, as it can also be influenced by 'base_sales'.",
