  "Explanation": "The return of 'cool' could either be from 'cloudy' weather regardless of the season, or from 'rainy' weather during 'summer'. Without intervention to specify or control the season, you cannot conclusively determine whether it was 'cloudy' or 'rainy' based solely on the effect of the function returning 'cool'.",
