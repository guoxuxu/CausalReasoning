  "Explanation": "By increasing the sales_target, adjust_advertising calculates a higher budget_increase (assuming current_sales stays the same) which in turn, when fed into sales_forecast function as a higher advertising_budget, leads to increased forecasted_sales. This is a direct intervention elevating both the advertising budget and resultant forecasted sales.",
