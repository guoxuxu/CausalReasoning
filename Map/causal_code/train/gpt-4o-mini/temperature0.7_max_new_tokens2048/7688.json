  "Explanation": "Even if 'status' is changed to 'success' manually, the 'processed' key is not set in the part of the code handling an error ('if 'error' in data'). The code exits the function after setting 'status' to 'failed', thereby not reaching the section where 'processed' would be set to True. Hence, intervention on 'status' does not change the state of 'processed' when there is initially an error.",
