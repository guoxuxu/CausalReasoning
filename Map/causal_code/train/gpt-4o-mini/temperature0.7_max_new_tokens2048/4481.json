  "Problem": "class WeatherForecast {\n  public bool isRainy;\n  public int temperature;\n\n  public WeatherForecast(bool rain, int temp) {\n    isRainy = updateRainStatus(rain);\n    temperature = adjustTemperature(temp, rain);\n  }\n\n  private bool updateRainStatus(bool rain) {\n    return rain && (temperature < 20);\n  }\n\n  private int adjustTemperature(int temp, bool rain) {\n    if (rain) return temp - 5;\n    return temp;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf we were to intervene by artificially setting the temperature to 15 degrees during initialization, would it guarantee that isRainy always resolves to true if it is raining?",
  "Explanation": "By setting the temperature to 15 degrees and raining being true, according to updateRainStatus function, isRainy will always be set to true due to both conditions (rain == true and temperature < 20) being fulfilled by the intervention.",
