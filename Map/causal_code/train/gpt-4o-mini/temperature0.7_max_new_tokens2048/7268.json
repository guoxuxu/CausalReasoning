  "Explanation": "The temperature being at 18 degrees could indicate that the environment naturally cooled to that level, or adjustments were made that tried to set it below 18 degrees, but the system's logic prevented it from going lower than 18. A manual setting by a technician prior to this doesn't necessarily mean an attempt was made to set it lower than 18; the manual setting could have been at or above 18.",
