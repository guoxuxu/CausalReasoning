  "Explanation": "This question tests causal inference from cause (ensuring window is closed if it's rainy) to effect (system’s suggestion) with an intervention. The intervention effectively changes the operational environment of the system so that a situation where the window is open while it's raining (trigger condition for the alert) is prevented. Hence, the system would not need to suggest closing the window under any conditions of the weather.",
