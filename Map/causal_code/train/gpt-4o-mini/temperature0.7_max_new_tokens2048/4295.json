  "Explanation": "The method adjustTemperature directly sets the temperature based on the logic provided there. Turning the airConditioningOn to true outside of this method does not affect the internal operations of adjustTemperature for setting temperature; thus, the temperature remains determined solely by the conditions within the method.",
