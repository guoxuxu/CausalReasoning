  "Explanation": "Increasing the budget in the holiday season from 4000 to 6000 changes the marketing strategy from 'standard_campaign' to 'intensive_campaign'. Intensive campaigns have a higher effective sales performance in all economic conditions according to the code, leading to increased sales.",
