  "Explanation": "Artificially altering the inventory, such as increasing the stock of apples, affects the conditions checked during `receive_order`. If inventory for apples is artificially raised to exceed or meet a pending order quantity, the method may transition to processing the order, changing the output to 'Order processed'.",
