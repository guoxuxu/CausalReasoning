The function calculates the weighted sum of corresponding elements in each sub-list of `data` using `weights` and returns a list of these sums.\"\n  },\n\nSuppose you observe zero in all calculated scores, does this imply that all weights or all data points were zero?",
  "Explanation": "Zero scores can result from all weights being zero, all data points in a subset being zero, or a combination of both factors, thus observing zeros in scores can't definitively indicate which specific input (weights or data) was zero without further information.",
