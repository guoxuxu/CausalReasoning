  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, membership_status, promo_code_active):\n    discount = 0\n    if membership_status:\n        discount += 10\n    if promo_code_active:\n        discount += 5\n    final_price = max(0, price - (price * discount / 100))\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf a membership is granted (i.e., membership_status turns from false to true), will the final_price reduce?",
  "Explanation": "Granting a membership increases the discount percentage by 10%, which results in a greater discount amount subtracted from the original price, thereby reducing the final_price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
