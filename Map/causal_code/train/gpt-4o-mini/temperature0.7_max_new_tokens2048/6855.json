  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention: A decrease in final_score could be caused by multiple factors: a reduction in base_score or bonus, an increase in penalty, or a decrease in score_multiplier. Without more information, we cannot conclusively determine that a decrease in score_multiplier is the sole reason for the decrease in final_score.",
