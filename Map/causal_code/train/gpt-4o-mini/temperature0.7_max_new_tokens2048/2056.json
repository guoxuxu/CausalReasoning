  "Explanation": "Setting 'final_prices' to zero does not necessarily imply that 'coupon_value' has been changed. This could occur through intervention in the code that directly alters 'final_prices' or changes to the input prices array; thus we cannot deduce changes to 'coupon_value' without further information.",
