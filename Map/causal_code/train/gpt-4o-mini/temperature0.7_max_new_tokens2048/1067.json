  "Explanation": "While increasing the 'to_account' balance changes its state, it does not retrospectively affect the conditions that led to a previous transfer failure, such as 'from_account' not having enough balance or 'from_account' not existing. The success of a transfer is determined by conditions existing at the time of the transfer attempt, not the subsequent adjustments to account balances.",
