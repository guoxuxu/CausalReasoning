  "Explanation": "Altering the subtraction factor to three times the standard deviation still involves deriving values from the original data's deviation relative to its statistical properties. Extreme values will still ultimately affect the normalized outcome and thus the alert flag, though the flag might be set differently depending on the new threshold relation.",
