  "Explanation": "After shipping 50 units, the stock level is at 50. The intervention of checking the stock if it is above 50 before receiving new stock would prevent any stock increase since the condition is exactly 50, which does not exceed the limit set. This tests the impact of an intervening rule or condition on the consequent stock level.",
