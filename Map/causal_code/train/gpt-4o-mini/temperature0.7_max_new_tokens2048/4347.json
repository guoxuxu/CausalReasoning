  "Problem": "def student_performance(height, study_hours, part_time_job):\n  stress_level = 0.4 * part_time_job\n  rest_quality = -0.3 * stress_level\n  study_efficiency = study_hours * (0.5 + 0.2 * rest_quality)\n  health = 0.6 * height - 0.5 * stress_level\n  performance = 0.3 * health + 0.7 * study_efficiency\n  return performance\n\n# Example invocation\nperformance = student_performance(170, 5, 1)\",\n\nIf rest quality is artificially enhanced using a hypothetical intervention, like better sleep quality aids, will this adjustment improve the student's study efficiency?",
  "Explanation": "Enhancing rest quality increases the modifier that boosts study_efficiency. Since study_efficiency directly contributes a major part to performance, improving rest quality through intervention will elevate study efficiency indirectly.",

Improved rest quality enhances study efficiency, which is also positively influenced by study hours. Height contributes to health, while stress level negatively impacts health.
