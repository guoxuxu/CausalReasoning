  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(weather, holiday, discount): \n  if weather == 'sunny':\n    mood = 'happy'\n  else:\n    mood = 'normal'\n  if holiday:\n    free_time = 2\n  else:\n    free_time = 1\n  if discount:\n    spending_power = 1.5\n  else:\n    spending_power = 1\n  sales = (mood == 'happy') * free_time * spending_power\n  return sales\",\n\nIf the weather is sunny, will sales necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "While sunny weather influences mood to 'happy', which might increase sales, sales also depend on variables such as whether it's a holiday and if there is a discount ongoing. Without knowing these other conditions, an increase in sales isn’t guaranteed.",
