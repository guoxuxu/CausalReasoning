  "Problem": "def calculate_bonus(salary, performance_rating):\n    if performance_rating > 8:\n        bonus = salary * 0.2\n    elif performance_rating > 5:\n        bonus = salary * 0.1\n    else:\n        bonus = 0\n    return bonus\",\n\nIf the bonus amount observed increases significantly, can we infer that the function to calculate bonus was modified to a higher fixed percentage above a certain performance rating?",
  "Explanation": "A significant increase in bonus not attributed by the corresponding thresholds of the original logic (5 and 8) implies that there may have been an intervention, such as modifying the bonus calculation to a higher fixed percentage. This suggests the function was altered to provide greater incentives.",
