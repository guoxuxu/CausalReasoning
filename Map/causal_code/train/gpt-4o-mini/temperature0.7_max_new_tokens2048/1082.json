  "Explanation": "External changes to the temperature do not automatically affect whether it begins to rain or not. Raining is controlled only by the rainChange parameter in the adjustWeather method, regardless of temperature.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
