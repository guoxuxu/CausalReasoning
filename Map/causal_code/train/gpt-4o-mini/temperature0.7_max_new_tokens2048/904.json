  "Explanation": "In the given function, voter turnout is a direct consequence of the population size. Increasing population linearly increases the voter turnout, as `voter_turnout = (population - fees) * 0.5`. Here, turnout directly depends on population, assuming fees remain constant and no interventions are made in other variables.",
