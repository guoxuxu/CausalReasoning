  "Explanation": "The observed decrease in revenue could be due to various other factors such as a reduction in price or decline in general market demand, irrespective of season change. Holding marketing spend constant isolates only one variable, while others could independently affect revenue. Therefore, just observing a decrease in revenue does not definitively indicate a seasonal change from 'summer' to 'winter'.",
