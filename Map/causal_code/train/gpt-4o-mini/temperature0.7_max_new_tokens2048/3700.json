  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"A simple inventory system that manages orders and stock for items. When an order is made for an item, the stock quantity decreases. If the stock goes below a minimum threshold, a restock action is triggered automatically.\",\n    \"code\": \"class InventorySystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stock = {'apple': 50, 'banana': 30}\n        self.min_threshold = {'apple': 10, 'banana': 5}\n\n    def order_item(self, item_name, quantity):\n        if item_name in self.stock:\n            self.stock[item_name] -= quantity\n            if self.stock[item_name] < self.min_threshold[item_name]:\n                self.restock_item(item_name)\n\n    def restock_item(self, item_name):\n        self.stock[item_name] += 100\n\"\n  },\n\nIf the minimum threshold for apples is temporarily raised to 20, and 15 apples are ordered, will this automatically trigger a restock?",
  "Explanation": "Raising the threshold to 20 and then ordering 15 apples only reduces the stock from 50 to 35. However, if the temporary threshold is 20 (not shown in the original code but assumed for the scenario), then this stock level is above the new threshold, hence no restocking occurs based on the given conditions.",
