  "Explanation": "Intervening to help students manage stress can effectively reduce stress levels, but this reduction does not necessarily link back directly to the number of questions in a quiz. A reduced stress level could be due to the intervention's effectiveness, better coping mechanisms, or other factors, rather than solely the quiz format.",
