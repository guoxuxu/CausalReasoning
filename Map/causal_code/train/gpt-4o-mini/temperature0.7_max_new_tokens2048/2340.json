  "Explanation": "The code allows for `production_units` to exceed 100, both when `demand_rising` is True ('production_units = 100 + cost_increase') and when it is False ('production_units = 50 + cost_increase//2'). Thus, simply observing a `production_units` greater than 100 doesn't irrefutably tell us that `demand_rising` is True.",
