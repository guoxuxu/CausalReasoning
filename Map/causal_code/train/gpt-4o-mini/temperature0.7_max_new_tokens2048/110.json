  "Explanation": "The only place in the code where the adjustment_factor is decreased (multiplied by 0.9) is within the 'if' condition 'supply > demand'. Thus, if we observe that the adjustment_factor has decreased, it necessarily indicates that the supply was greater than the demand at the time of computation.",
