  "Problem": "class SalesAnalysis { double discount; double price; double increaseTraffic(double factor) { return factor * 0.5; } double salePrice() { return price - (price * discount); } }\",\n\nIf we fix the value of 'discount' and 'price', does an increase in external marketing (implemented as an intervention factor in 'increaseTraffic') affect 'salePrice'?",
  "Explanation": "The method 'increaseTraffic' does not interact with 'price' or 'discount' and hence does not affect 'salePrice' according to the provided class definition. 'salePrice' is solely computed based on 'price' and 'discount', which are static in this scenario.",
