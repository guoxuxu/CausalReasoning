  "Explanation": "Although the tax rate in 'East' (7%) is lower than in 'West' (9%), which could imply lower final prices, changing the region does not necessarily mean the average price will be typically higher or lower without knowing the baseline prices and discounts. The change in tax can have a lowering effect on the final prices.",
