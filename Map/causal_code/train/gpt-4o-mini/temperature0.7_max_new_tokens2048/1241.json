  "Explanation": "While 'report_temperature' showing a higher temperature suggests that the temperature was increased, it's possible the initial temperature set in the constructor or other external modifications to the temperature attribute could also account for the higher reading. Thus, increase in temperature does not necessarily imply 'increase_temperature' was directly responsible.",
