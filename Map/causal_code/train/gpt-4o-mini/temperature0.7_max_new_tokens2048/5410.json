  "Problem": "<above Python code>\",\n\nAssuming an intervention modifies the email address of 'new_user' to 'jane@example.com', could this be a reason for any subsequent failure in email sending?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the email to 'jane@example.com' does not detrimentally affect sending an email since it still satisfies the domain condition '@example.com'. Any failure should be attributed to other factors not shown in the code (like server issues).",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
