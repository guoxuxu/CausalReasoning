  "Explanation": "Adjusting the temperature has a direct impact on humidity when the temperature exceeds 25 degrees Celsius due to the additional increase of 10 units in humidity. Furthermore, altering the temperature can affect the conditional logic in adjust_humidity method, impacting humidity adjustment indirectly.",
