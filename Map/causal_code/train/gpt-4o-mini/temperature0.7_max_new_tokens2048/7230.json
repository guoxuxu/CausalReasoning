  "Explanation": "The output of `process_data()` depends on multiple steps including noise removal and normalization before data gets analyzed. Therefore, a high value in `process_data()` doesn't necessarily imply that `analyze_data()` is biased; instead, it could be the result of how the data was processed in earlier steps.",
