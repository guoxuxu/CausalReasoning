  "Explanation": "Since the code specifies that 'update_started' is only returned if 'db_status' equals 'active' when 'user_click' is True, obtaining this result implies that the database status must have been 'active'. This is a clear example of 'from effect to cause without intervention' where the effect ('update_started') directly points to its unaltered cause ('db_status' being 'active').",
