  "Explanation": "Reduction in score can be affected by interventions other than those on temperature, such as starting or stopping rain (changing the mood). For example, if it stops raining, and temperature remains below 20, the score still reduces from 80 to 60 if the mood shifts from 'happy' to 'sad'. This does not involve any direct modification on the temperature.",
