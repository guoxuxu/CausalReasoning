  "Explanation": "Since the multiplier in the adjusted computation has been labeled as adjustable but not specified or constrained, altering it allows multiple possibilities for the value of 'original'. 'Original' can be low or high depending on the chosen multiplier, making it impossible to infer its exact range just based on the outcome being 'low'.",
