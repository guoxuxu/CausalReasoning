  "Explanation": "According to the function, 'No Medication' is prescribed either if the patient is 50 years or younger without other stipulating random conditions being true or these conditions are not met if age is above 50. But, an intervention directly leading to 'No Medication' simplifies to the case where age is 50 or under.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Age and heart rate influence medication prescriptions; specifically, being over 50 and having a heart rate over 100 leads to a Beta Blocker prescription, while being over 50 with a heart rate of 100 or lower leads to an ACE Inhibitor. If the age is 50 or younger and a random choice does not favor medication, then it results in 'No Medication'. A heart rate intervention can change the prescription.",
