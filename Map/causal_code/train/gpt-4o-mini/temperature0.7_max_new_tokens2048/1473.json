  "Explanation": "Applying the 'exercise()' intervention increases both steps and heart rate. If the increase in heart rate isn't sufficiently offset (for example, through relaxation or other means to reduce the heart rate afterwards), it might increase the chances of the person being at risk, especially if they remain inactive otherwise. This showcases a causal relationship from intervention (exercise) to the effect (change in risk status).",
