  "Explanation": "Changing the temperature via change_temperature method affects is_raining directly through the update_weather method that checks the temperature conditions for raining. Since water_plants depends on is_raining, changing the temperature can make it rain or stop raining, thus affecting whether the plants need to be watered.",
