  "Explanation": "A decrease in blood pressure cannot conclusively indicate that medication was applied because the stress level (which influences blood pressure) might have decreased as well, or other factors not included in the code could also be at play. Specifically, the scenario doesn't exclude the possibility blood pressure might decrease naturally or through other interventions.",
