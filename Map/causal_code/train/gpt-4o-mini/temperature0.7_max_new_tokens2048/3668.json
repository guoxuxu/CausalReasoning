  "Explanation": "By intervening and changing the account_balance to a value greater than 10000, and adjusting the condition for the bonus (i.e., changing its value), the total_balance is affected as the bonus increment changed adds to the total balance. This is a case of forward causal inference with intervention.",

The interest rate also influences the total interest, and both the bonus and total interest contribute to the total balance.",
