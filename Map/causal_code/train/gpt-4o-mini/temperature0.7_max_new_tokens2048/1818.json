  "Explanation": "The fact that it is not raining only implies that it either hasn’t been triggered to start rain or the temperature is below 32 degrees. Since raining can also be false if the temperature is above 50 degrees and startRain() was not called, we cannot conclusively determine the exact temperature range just from the absence of rain.",
