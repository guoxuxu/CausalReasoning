  "Explanation": "Adding an operation to adjust the threshold affects whether the resultant temperature after the increase and decrease crosses the new threshold. For instance, reducing the threshold below the maximum temperature reached (35 before decreasing, 30 after) will likely result in the power being switched to 'ON' earlier or being 'OFF' depending on the adjusted threshold. Manipulating the threshold is a form of intervention that directly impacts the final power state.",
