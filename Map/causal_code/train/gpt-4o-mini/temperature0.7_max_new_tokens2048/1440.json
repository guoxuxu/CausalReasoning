  "Explanation": "The health state of a plant is dependent on the alterations made to 'primary_need' and 'secondary_need' by the methods in the Garden class. These needs are adjusted via 'water_plants' and 'sunbathe_plants' methods, which set the necessary conditions for a plant's health as checked in 'check_health' method.",
