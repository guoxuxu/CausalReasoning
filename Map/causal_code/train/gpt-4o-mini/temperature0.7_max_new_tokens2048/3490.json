  "Explanation": "The `is_adult` flag is determined based on whether age is greater than 18. Changing the age from 20 to 30, although modifies the age, does not alter the Boolean output of `age > 18` because both 20 and 30 satisfy this condition. Hence, the `is_adult` flag remains True irrespective of this change.",
