  "Explanation": "Intervening the system to be 'stable' does not equate to an exact temperature set unless other context is provided. 'Stable' generally means it is not in a 'danger', 'warning', 'critical', or 'caution' state, thus it could be any value not leading to those other states. Temperature settings like 31 would still result in 'stable' status.",
