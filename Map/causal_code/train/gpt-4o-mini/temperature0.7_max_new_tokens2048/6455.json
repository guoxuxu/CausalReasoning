  "Explanation": "Within the 'update_inventory' function, the lower the 'current_inventory' after adjusting for 'units_sold_estimate', especially when falling below the threshold of 10, the higher the calculated 'order_quantity'. This happens because there is a direct formula in the code that sets 'order_quantity' based on how low the 'new_inventory' is.",
