  "Explanation": "Although an external factor causing a higher profit margin generally implies more efficient operations, it does not necessarily mean total expenses will decrease. Increased profit margin can occur due to higher sales or better pricing strategies. Expenses are not directly affected unless specified by the intervention, particularly in the given code setup where expenses depend solely on the input data array.",
