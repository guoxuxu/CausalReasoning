  "Problem": "def compute_final_price(base_price, tax_rate, discount, has_discount):\n    tax_amount = base_price * tax_rate\n    if has_discount:\n        discount_amount = base_price * discount\n    else:\n        discount_amount = 0\n    final_price = (base_price - discount_amount) + tax_amount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final_price is seen to increase after an intervention, can we infer that the discount was removed or reduced?",
  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: An increase in final_price after an intervention may result from either removing or reducing the discount, but it can also be due to increases in the base_price or tax_rate. Without knowing which parameter was specifically altered, it is impossible to attribute the cause solely to changes in the discounting process.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The base price directly influences the final price, while the tax rate affects the tax amount, which also influences the final price. The presence of a discount, indicated by has_discount, affects the discount amount, which in turn influences the final price. Therefore, if the final price increases, it may imply a reduction or removal of the discount.",
