  "Explanation": "Setting the season to holiday and increasing the budget to 6000 ensures the marketing strategy is set to 'intensive_campaign'. According to the code, an intensive campaign results in improved sales numbers across all economic conditions. Therefore, intervention increases sales irrespective of economic condition.",
