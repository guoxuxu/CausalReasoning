  "Explanation": "While being sunny typically implies that the temperature is above 20, the implementation always sets 'isSunny' based on the temperature being greater than 20. However, without additional information or the current state (e.g., just after it stops raining), we can't infer this as certain if we only observe 'isSunny' without knowing recent weather changes.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature directly influences whether it is sunny, with higher temperatures resulting in sunny conditions. Additionally, starting rain causes it to rain and eliminates sunny conditions, while stopping rain restores the conditions depending on the temperature. Increasing temperature raises the temperature and can also lead to sunnier conditions, whereas decreasing temperature lowers the temperature and may result in less sunny conditions.",
