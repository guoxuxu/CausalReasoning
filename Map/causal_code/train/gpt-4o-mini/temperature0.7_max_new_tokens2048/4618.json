  "Explanation": "A high heart rate can be indicative of various conditions or situations including natural responses to physical activity. The code does depict heart rate decreasing with exercise, particularly more so in younger individuals. However, a previously high heart rate does not directly imply that the exercise response isn’t proper without considering factors like initial fitness level, intensity of exercise, and individual health conditions.",
