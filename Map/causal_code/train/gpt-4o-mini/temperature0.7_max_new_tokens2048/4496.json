  "Explanation": "The direct reasoning from a temperature of 12 degrees to a specific time of day is not straightforward in this simulator. Although temperature reduces in the early morning (temperature -= 5), if this was immediately following daytime where the temperature had been increased by 8 degrees resulting in at least 20 degrees, it would still be above 15 degrees, thus it is unlikely to be early morning solely based on 12 degrees observation without considering previous states.",
