  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, demand, tax_rate):\n    tax = price * demand * tax_rate\n    final_sales = price * demand + tax\n    return final_sales\",\n\nIf we set a fixed tax_rate and increase the price, will this lead to an increase in final_sales?",
  "Explanation": "Intervening to set the tax_rate fixed and increasing the price will result in an increase in the tax component (price * demand * fixed tax_rate) and the price * demand component of final_sales. These changes will lead to an overall increase in final_sales, as seen from the multiplication relationships in the code.",
