  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.9\n        else:\n            return price\n    elif season == 'winter':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.8\n        else:\n            return price * 1.1\n    else:\n        return price\",\n\nIf it is observed that the sales price is reduced to 80% of the original price, can we conclude the season was winter?",
  "Explanation": "In this setup, 80% reduction is specific to the 'winter' season with a discount applied and does not occur in any other season or condition.",
