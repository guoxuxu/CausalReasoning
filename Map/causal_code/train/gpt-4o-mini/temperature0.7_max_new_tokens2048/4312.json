  "Explanation": "Resetting expenses to zero does not affect `self.funds`, which `current_balance()` returns. `current_balance()` is independent of `self.expenses`' totals and depends solely on the transactions already applied to `self.funds`. Thus, resetting `self.expenses` does not inherently recalibrate `self.funds` to its initial state without specific intervention to adjust the fund's value.",
