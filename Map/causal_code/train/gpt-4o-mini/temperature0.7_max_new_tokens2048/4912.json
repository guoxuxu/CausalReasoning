  "Explanation": "Since revenue is inversely related to the discounts (revenue = sales * (1 - discount)), an increase in discounts results in higher reduction of the sales price, leading to decreased revenue.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
