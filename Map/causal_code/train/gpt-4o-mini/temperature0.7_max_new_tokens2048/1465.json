  "Explanation": "Multiplying 'data_input' by a higher factor (20 instead of 10) increases 'adjusted_data' more dramatically. Consequently, it becomes more likely to exceed the threshold of 50, making it more probable to print 'Value is above threshold.' because 'result' will more frequently be 'High'.",
