  "Explanation": "An increase in 'next_year_sales' can be attributed to increases in either 'base_sales', 'market_growth', or 'marketing_spend'. Without specific information or control over the other variables, it cannot be conclusively said that an increase in 'market_growth' alone caused the increase in 'next_year_sales'.",
