  "Explanation": "Since final_result is directly dependent on the output of analyze_data, and analyze_data evaluates whether data is greater than 20 to return 'High', increasing raw_input such that processed_input exceeds 20 will change final_result to 'High'. In this case, setting raw_input to any value greater than 10 (e.g., 15) would make processed_input (which is double of raw_input) greater than 20, thus resulting in 'High'.",
