  "Explanation": "Setting the discount percentage to 0 by intervention breaks the natural link between loyalty points and discount eligibility. Normally, fewer than 100 loyalty points would result in no discount, but because this was forced through intervention, one cannot determine the loyalty points from the discount_percentage.",
