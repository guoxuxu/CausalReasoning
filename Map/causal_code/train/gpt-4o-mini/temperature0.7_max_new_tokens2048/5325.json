  "Explanation": "Setting 'processed' to zero as an intervention prior to output disregards any modification made based on 'flag' status, making the effect of 'flag' on 'processed' unobservable in the output.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
