  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, restock, initial_inventory):\n    current_inventory = initial_inventory\n    for sale in sales:\n        if current_inventory > sale:\n            current_inventory -= sale\n        else:\n            current_inventory = 0\n    if restock:\n        current_inventory += 100\n    return current_inventory\",\n\nIf the return value of the function is zero, does that mean no sales occurred?",
  "Explanation": "The function returning zero could result either from sales equaling or exceeding the total available inventory (initial plus restocked) or from having an initial inventory of zero with no sales happening. Thus, a return value of zero does not necessarily imply that no sales occurred; it could merely mean that sales completely depleted the inventory.",
