  "Explanation": "In the given code, there is a conditional check for 'age' being greater than 30. If this condition is satisfied, the discount is initially set at 0.2. This happens without any other intervention, assuming other conditions or absence of other modifiers (like 'new_customer') not discussed in the question.",
