The sentiment tagging can occasionally fail due to API timeouts.\",\n        \"Code\": \"def categorize_post(post):\n    keywords = extract_keywords(post.content)\n    category = determine_category(keywords)\n    return category\n\ndef tag_sentiment(post):\n    try:\n        sentiment = sentiment_analysis_api(post.content)\n    except TimeoutError:\n        sentiment = 'Unknown'\n    post.sentiment = sentiment\n    return sentiment\n\ndef publish_post(post):\n    category = categorize_post(post)\n    sentiment = tag_sentiment(post)\n    database.save(post.category, post.sentiment, post.content)\n    return 'Post Published'\"\n    },\n\nIf a new policy requires manual review of posts with 'Unknown' sentiment tags before publishing, will this affect the number of posts published with incorrect categories?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention targets posts based on their sentiment tagging, which is independent of the categorization process. Categorizing posts is handled by a separate function using keywords extracted from the content, not sentiment. Thus, manual review based on sentiment would not impact the accuracy of categories assigned to posts.",
