  "Explanation": "Higher discounts result in lower 'discounted_prices', which directly decrease the 'total'. Since the 'final_total' is computed by adding 'tax_amount' to the 'total', a lower starting total leads to a lower 'final_total'. No external alterations (interventions) were made to other variables.",
