  "Explanation": "Noticing that a student needs support indicates elevated stress levels, which could indeed result from answering more than 5 questions. However, stress could also accumulate through answering multiple smaller quizzes or from external sources outside the scope of this specific quiz, thus it is not a definitive indicator of the number of questions answered.",

If the quiz contains more than 5 questions, this further elevates the students' stress levels. If a student's stress level exceeds 2, the teacher evaluates their performance and may identify that the student needs support.",
