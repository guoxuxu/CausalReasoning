  "Explanation": "Setting y to 25 is an intervention that changes its original value derived from x (which is 25). Since z depends on y (z = y - 4), z changes to 21. Consequently, w, which is the sum of the new z and the intervened y, equals 46. This value is different from its initial calculation based on the original values.",
