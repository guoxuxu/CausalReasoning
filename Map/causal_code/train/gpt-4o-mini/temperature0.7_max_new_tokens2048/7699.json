  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(store_hours, advertising_budget):\n    if store_hours > 8:\n        sales = 100\n    else:\n        sales = 50\n    if advertising_budget > 500:\n        sales *= 1.5\n    return sales\",\n\nIf the store hours are increased from 6 hours to 10 hours and simultaneous modification of advertising budget is prohibited, will there be an increase in sales?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, increasing store hours from less than or equal to 8 to more than 8 increases sales from 50 to 100, regardless of the advertising budget, provided that the budget is not altered.",
