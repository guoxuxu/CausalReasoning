  "Explanation": "The activation of street lights is only triggered within the turnOnSignals method and only if the isNight variable is true. This variable becomes true only during nighttime hours (after 6 pm or before 6 am) as defined by the time parameter checked against the isNight condition. There's no other logic leading to the activation of street lights.",
