  "Explanation": "A decrease in prey could be due to multiple factors in this model, including increased predator numbers or changes in their death rates. Resource levels influence prey growth rates but are not directly dependent on current prey population sizes; rather, they impact future prey growth rates. Therefore, a declining prey population does not necessarily imply that resources have decreased.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If resources are greater than 50, then the prey growth rate increases to 0.1, leading to an increase in prey population. Conversely, if resources are less than or equal to 50, the prey growth rate decreases to 0.02, which results in a smaller increase in prey population. The number of predators influences the predator consumption rate, which decreases resources as predators consume them. Additionally, a higher number of predators leads to a greater predator death rate, which can reduce the predator population. Finally, an increase in prey can contribute to an increase in the predator population.",
