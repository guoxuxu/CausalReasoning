  "Problem": "Room class with methods to adjust temperature based on heater and window states.\",\n\nWhat would happen to the room temperature if we closed any open windows and turned the heater on?",
  "Explanation": "Closing the windows would prevent the temperature from decreasing by 3 degrees due to the windows being open. Turning the heater on would subsequently increase the temperature by 5 degrees. This combined management ensures a net increase in temperature.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
