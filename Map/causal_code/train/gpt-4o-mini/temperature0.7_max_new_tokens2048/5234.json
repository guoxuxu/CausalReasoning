  "Explanation": "While a lower price could result from applying a discount through 'discount_product', it's also plausible that the price was changed by a direct modification in the code or adjustments outside of the 'discount_product' method (like errors or special adjustments not captured by this system). Intervention to witness the method invocation would be necessary to confirm.",
