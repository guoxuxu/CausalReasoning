  "Explanation": "In the given code, the status is set to 'failed' only when an 'error' key is found in the input data. If such key was not present, the status would be 'success'. There is no other route in the code to lead to a 'failed' status; therefore, if the output status is 'failed', the 'error' key had to be present.",
