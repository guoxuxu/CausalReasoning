  "Explanation": "With intervention, decreasing the traffic density to 40 on a non-holiday (implicitly changing the trafficDensity), will lead to an increase in traffic speed to 70 km/h according to the `else if` condition in the `calculateTrafficSpeed()` method, where it checks if the trafficDensity is less than 50.",
