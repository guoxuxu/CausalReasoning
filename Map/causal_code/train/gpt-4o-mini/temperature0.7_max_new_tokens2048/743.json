  "Explanation": "If the final_price is less after changes to the discount logic, it suggests that other alterations like tax_rate adjustments or the updated logic in apply_discount are more directly responsible. Simply changing the base_price with unchanged tax rate or discount logic would not solely account for a reduced final_price; the effect implies broader modifications.",
