  "Explanation": "While the code sets the status to 'overheat' if the temperature exceeds 30 degrees, it's also theoretically possible for the status to be externally modified or set in a different part of the program not shown here. Thus, without knowing the entire context, we cannot definitively conclude that a status of 'overheat' was caused exclusively by the temperature being above 30 degrees.",
