  "Explanation": "Setting 'IsLoyaltyMember' to True for all records will likely increase the number of instances where discounts are applied (for totals over 1000), thus altering 'DiscountedTotal'. This tests the intervention from a cause (loyalty status) to an effect (total with potential discount).",
