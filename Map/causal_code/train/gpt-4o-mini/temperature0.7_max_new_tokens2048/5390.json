  "Explanation": "A risk level of 3 could be due to being a smoker (which adds 2 to the risk) and being over 50 (which adds 1 to the risk) or just being a smoker while being 50 or younger (since being exactly 50 does not add to the risk). Since the risk could be exclusively from smoking, we cannot conclude solely based on a risk level of 3 that the person is older than 50 without information about smoking status.",
