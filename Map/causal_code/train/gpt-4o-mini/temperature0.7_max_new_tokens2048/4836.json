  "Explanation": "Raising the alert depends on both 'status' being 'hot' and 'risk' being 'high'. While a 'status' of 'hot' does infer a temperature above 30, an alert could be raised due to other rules potentially present in the system not shown explicitly in the given code (e.g., interventions in the rules or added conditions).",
