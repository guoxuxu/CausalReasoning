  "Explanation": "Raining being true does not necessarily mean the temperature is above 30 degrees. Rain can be set to true either from previous conditions or directly via 'changeWeather' if the temperature being set is above 30, but this is not the only way it can rain as prior states or initial conditions can influence this.",
