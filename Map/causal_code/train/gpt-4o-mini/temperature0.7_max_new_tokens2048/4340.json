  "Explanation": "Increased signal strength can be due to closer proximity of the user to the base signal, removal of smaller obstacles like trees, or even a calculation error. Removal of large obstacles like buildings could be a reason but isn't the only one. This makes it unreliable to definitively infer their removal from increased signal strength alone without other context.",
