  "Problem": "See above\",\n\nIf the calculated average is significantly large, does this indicate that the code now excludes extremely low values through a new computational step?",
  "Explanation": "A high average by itself doesn't confirm the introduction of a new computational step for excluding low values; it could simply mean the dataset primarily contains higher numbers, or the threshold set excludes lower values.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
