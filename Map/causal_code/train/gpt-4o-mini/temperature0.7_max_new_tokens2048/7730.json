  "Explanation": "The accelerate method includes a check to ensure that the car's speed does not exceed 120. Whenever the speed reaches or exceeds 120, it is set to 120. Therefore, calling the accelerate method does not guarantee that the speed will always exceed 120, but it will ensure that it does not.",
