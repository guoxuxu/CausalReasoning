  "Explanation": "Although the decreaseTemperature method sets acState to true, having both acState and heaterState true simultaneously cannot result solely from calling decreaseTemperature, because it checks for heaterState being off before changing acState. Thus, you cannot conclusively determine that decreaseTemperature() was called based solely on these conditions.",
