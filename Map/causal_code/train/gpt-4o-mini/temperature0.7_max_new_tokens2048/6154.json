  "Explanation": "Although the reset operation would indeed set active status to false, having an inactive status does not necessarily imply a reset; it might simply indicate that the count of steps has never exceeded the 10,000 threshold. This explores the inference from observed effect (inactive status) back to a specific cause (reset operation) when intervention is possible.",
