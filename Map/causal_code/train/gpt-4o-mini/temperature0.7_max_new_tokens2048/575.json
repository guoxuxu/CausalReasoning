  "Problem": "def compute_health_scores(age, diet_quality, physical_activity_level):\n    base_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_score -= 10\n    if diet_quality < 5:\n        base_score -= 30\n    if physical_activity_level > 7:\n        base_score += 20\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf an intervention adjusts diet_quality above the threshold of 5, while keeping other factors constant, will the health score increase?",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, if diet_quality is improved above 5, the condition to subtract 30 from base_score for poor diet does not execute. This leads to a higher score, assuming age and physical_activity_level are held constant.",
