  "Problem": "def calculate_health(age, smoker, exercise_freq):\n    base_health = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_health -= (age - 50) * 2\n    if smoker:\n        base_health -= 30\n    if exercise_freq >= 3:\n        base_health += 20\n    return base_health\",\n\nAssuming a person has a higher health score after intervention, can we infer the person increased their exercise frequency?",
  "Explanation": "Although increasing exercise frequency positively impacts the health score, a higher score post-intervention does not conclusively indicate that exercise frequency was increased. Other factors such as reduction in age penalty (unlikely but hypothetically considering lifestyle changes or errors in initial age recording) or stopping smoking could also be responsible. Therefore, this doesn't reliably indicate a cause, demonstrating the complexity of inferring specific causes solely from the effect, even with intervention.",
