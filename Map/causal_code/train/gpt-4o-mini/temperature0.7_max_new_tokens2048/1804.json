  "Explanation": "The reset method itself doesn’t manipulate external temperatures or their thresholds against which temperatures are checked. It only resets the internal states to their default values. No change in is_heating_on after reset does not necessarily mean external temperatures haven’t dropped below the threshold; it only indicates that update_temperature hasn’t yet been called or external conditions didn’t initiate heating.",
