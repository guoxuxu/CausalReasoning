  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code=None):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == '10OFF' else 0.05 if coupon_code == '5OFF' else 0\n    discount = total * discount_rate\n    total_after_discount = total - discount\n    return total_after_discount\",\n\nIf we see that the total_after_discount is less than the original total, can we conclude a coupon code was definitely used?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of a reduction in the total after discount compared to the original total indicates that a discount was applied; however, it's also possible for the discount rate to be zero even with a coupon code or without any coupon code (as in the default case). Thus, we cannot conclusively say that a coupon was used just because there’s a discount observed.",
