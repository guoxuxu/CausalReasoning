  "Explanation": "Even if the `heater_override` is set to False, the temperature might decrease due to other factors such as a significant drop in `external_temp`. The absence of an increase in `temperature` cannot conclusively indicate that `heater_override` was set to True or False without knowing the accompanying change in `external_temp`.",
