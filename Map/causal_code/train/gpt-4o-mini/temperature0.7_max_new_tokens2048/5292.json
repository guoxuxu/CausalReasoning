  "Explanation": "An increase in heart rate by 10 units might occur both from drinking coffee or from increasing physical activity (especially if the person is aged 50 or above in the case of drinking coffee, or under any age for activity increase). Thus, the specific cause (drinking coffee) of the increase cannot be conclusively determined.",
