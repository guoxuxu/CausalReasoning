  "Explanation": "The fan status being 'on' suggests that the temperature is above 30, but the alert status 'normal' is influenced by both temperature and humidity. The fan being 'on' only provides information about the temperature but not the humidity, so it does not directly affect the likelihood of having a 'normal' alert status.",
