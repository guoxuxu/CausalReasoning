  "Problem": "def sales_forecast(hours_worked, ad_budget): \n  productivity = hours_worked * 0.5\n  ad_effectiveness = ad_budget * 0.3\n  total_sales = (productivity + ad_effectiveness) * 1000 \n  return total_sales\",\n\nIf the number of hours worked is increased, will that always directly increase the total sales?",
  "Explanation": "In the given function, increasing hours_worked increases productivity (hours_worked * 0.5). As productivity contributes linearly to total_sales (through the sum with ad_effectiveness and multiplication by 1000), an increase in hours worked results in an increase in total sales.",
