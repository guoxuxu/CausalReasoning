  "Explanation": "From effect (getsWet) to cause (isRaining) without intervention: The person getting wet directly implies that it must be raining, per code logic, since `getsWet` relies on the truth of `isRaining` coupled with `hasUmbrella` being false. There isn't an alternate way coded for the person to get wet.",
