  "Explanation": "A return value of zero could imply either `flag` was `True` and the mean of `data` was zero, or `flag` was `False` and the maximum item was equal to the minimum item in `data` (range of zero). Hence, the exact input state (values of `data` or status of `flag`) can't be definitively inferred, but we can deduce there was some form of data configuration or intervention leading to these scenarios.",
