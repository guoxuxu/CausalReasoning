  "Explanation": "Manually adjusting the 'age_increase' values would directly affect the salaries, since these increments based on the category influence the final salary calculation. If 'age_increase' values decrease, this would necessarily lead to a decrease in 'salary', displaying a causal effect from intervention (adjusting age increases) to a consequence (drop in salaries).",
