  "Explanation": "Manual intervention by turning on the heater independently increases the room temperature by 5 degrees when the room temperature is below 20 degrees. This would make any observed increase in temperature ambiguous as to whether it is due to the outside temperature or the manually turned on heater.",

  "causal_map_integration": "A decrease in outside temperature below 0 degrees causes an increase in humidity. An increase in outside temperature above 30 degrees causes the air conditioning to turn on and results in a decrease in temperature. When the room temperature is below 20 degrees, turning on the heater causes an increase in temperature. Additionally, if humidity exceeds 60, it decreases either with or without the air conditioning being on. Conversely, if humidity is below 40, it increases.",
