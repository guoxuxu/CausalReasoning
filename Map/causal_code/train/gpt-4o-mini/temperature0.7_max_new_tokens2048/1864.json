  "Explanation": "Capping the 'total' cost (effect) could result from multiple interventions. It could be due to an increase in 'discount' or a decrease in prices of 'products' or even a decrease in 'tax' rate. Without more specific information, this conclusion about the increase in 'discount' would be incorrect as the effect could be due to multiple causes.",
