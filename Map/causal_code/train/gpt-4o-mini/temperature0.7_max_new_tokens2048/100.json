  "Explanation": "An increase in 'discounted_price' can result from multiple possible interventions: decreasing 'base_discount', lowering 'customer_loyalty_status', or external factors altering 'item_price' itself. Without direct observation or data about 'customer_loyalty_status', we cannot conclusively attribute the increased 'discounted_price' to a decrease in discount via changing loyalty status alone.",
