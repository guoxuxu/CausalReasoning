  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total_price = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == 'SAVE10' else 0.05 if coupon_code == 'SAVE5' else 0\n    discount = total_price * discount_rate\n    final_price = total_price - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we change all prices of items to be higher, will the final_price using 'SAVE5' be significantly different?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the prices of items increases the total_price, which in turn increases the discount amount since 'SAVE5' offers a 5% discount. Therefore, the discount is larger, but the final price also increases due to the higher initial total_price.",
