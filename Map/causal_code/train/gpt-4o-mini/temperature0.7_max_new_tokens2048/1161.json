  "Explanation": "Although `apply_discount` can cause `total` to decrease, observing a decrease in `total` could also result from executing the `remove_item` method, which removes an item price from the list and updates the `total` accordingly. Therefore, a decrease in `total` does not necessarily infer that `apply_discount` was executed.",
