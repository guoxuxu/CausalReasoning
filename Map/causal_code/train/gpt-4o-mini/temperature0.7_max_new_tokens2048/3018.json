  "Explanation": "Increasing temperature will likely lead to sunnier weather (due to the is_sunny method in the Weather class). As the Mood class checks if the weather is sunny to determine happiness, a sunnier weather results in a happier mood, which in turn leads the Productivity class to conclude a higher likelihood of being productive.",
