  "Explanation": "Being classified as high risk does suggest they might meet the criteria of being over 50 and smoking; however, the code doesn't exclude potential future updates or changes where additional conditions might also set patient.highRisk to true. Therefore, while currently true, it's not a definitive backward conclusion without additional assumptions.",
