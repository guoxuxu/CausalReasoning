  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, stock, discount_factor):\n    if discount_factor > 0.5:\n        discount = price * 0.10\n    else:\n        discount = price * discount_factor\n    final_price = price - discount\n    total_sales = final_price * stock\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf total_sales have increased significantly, was this because of fixing the discount to 10% and increasing the price?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in total_sales cannot be solely attributed to fixing the discount at 10% and increasing the price. Factors like stock levels play a critical role, as the same discount and price increase on different stock levels would lead to different total_sales figures.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
