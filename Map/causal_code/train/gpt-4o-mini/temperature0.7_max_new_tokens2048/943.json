  "Explanation": "Decreasing the temperature and observing no rain could be due to other reasons such as the initial setting of the 'isRaining' flag to false, which is not solely dependent on temperature. We can’t exclusively conclude the original temperature was above 30°C without information about original settings or other conditions.",
