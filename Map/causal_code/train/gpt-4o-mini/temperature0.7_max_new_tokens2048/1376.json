  "Explanation": "Although changing the temperature typically involves calling the setTemperature method, the temperature value itself could be initialized or altered without directly invoking this method (e.g., during object initialization or through some other method we might add in the future). Moreover, a change in temperature does not indicate the method's invocation unless it is confirmed that the thermostat's power was on.",
