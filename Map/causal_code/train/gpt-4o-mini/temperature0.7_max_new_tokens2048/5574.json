  "Explanation": "While buying items over $100 gives an increase in points, the capability to redeem (having 50 or more points) doesn't necessarily imply that this threshold was crossed in one transaction. Multiple smaller purchases accumulating to 50 points, or other forms of point increments such as bonuses or corrections, could also allow redemption.",
