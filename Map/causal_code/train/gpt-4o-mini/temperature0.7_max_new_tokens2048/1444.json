  "Explanation": "The discounted price being less than 100 does not necessarily imply that the base price was not updated. The base price increase could still have occurred, but the random increase and the percentage discount combined could result in a final price less than 100. Therefore, the relationship between the final discounted price being less than 100 and the absence of a base price update does not hold as a deterministic causation.",
