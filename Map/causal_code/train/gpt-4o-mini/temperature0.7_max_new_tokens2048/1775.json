  "Explanation": "An increase in humidity does not directly imply that the temperature was recently increased. While high humidity results in a temperature rise when humidity exceeds 90 in the 'increaseHumidity' method, the humidity itself can be increased through other means such as directly calling 'increaseHumidity'.",
