  "Explanation": "Changing the 'marketing_strategy' to trigger marketing every 15 days increases the frequency of marketing impacts. As marketing impact directly adds a fixed amount to 'daily_sales' on days it is applied, increasing its frequency will increment the overall 'daily_sales' as compared to less frequent strategy scenarios.",
