  "Explanation": "Observing 'Sun' consistently does not conclusively indicate that Math.random() has been manipulated. 'Sun' can appear consistently due to natural variations of Math.random() values being frequently greater than 0.5 or the simulation running during non-rainy seasons under standard conditions.",
