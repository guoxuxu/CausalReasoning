  "Explanation": "By increasing `base_sales`, we directly increase `adjusted_sales` due to the multiplication by `adjustment_factor`. As `adjusted_sales` rises, even accounting for the possible increase in the `discount` (from meeting the threshold of sales greater than 1000), `final_price` will likely increase since the base multiplier has increased.",
