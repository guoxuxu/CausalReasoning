  "Explanation": "The `total_sales` method calculates the sum of `sales_data`. Higher values in `sales_data` lead directly to a higher sum being reported by `total_sales`, demonstrating a direct, unmediated causal relationship from the cause (higher sales values) to the effect (higher total reported).",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
