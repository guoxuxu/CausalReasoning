  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(discount, base_price, season):\n    if season == 'high':\n        increase = 0.10\n    else:\n        increase = -0.05\n    price_after_discount = base_price * (1 - discount)\n    final_price = price_after_discount * (1 + increase)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we control base_price and discount but observe an increase in final_price, can we conclude that the season changed to high?",
  "Explanation": "By controlling the base_price and discount and still observing an increase in the final_price, the only factor that can contribute to this outcome under the given function is the season switching to high, which positively affects the increase rate.",
