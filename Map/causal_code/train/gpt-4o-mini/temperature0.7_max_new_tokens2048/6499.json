  "Explanation": "The `walk` method in the HealthApp class reveals that whenever the `steps` variable is incremented by the `walk` function, the `calorieCount` is decremented by a specific fraction of the steps added (steps/20). Hence, an increase in steps will causally result in a decrease in calorie count without any external intervention.",
