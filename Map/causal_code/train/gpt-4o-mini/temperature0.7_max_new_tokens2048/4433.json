  "Explanation": "Directly setting `is_hot` to True as an intervention effectively simulates the condition of having a temperature greater than 27 degrees Celsius, even if the actual temperature does not validate this. As per the code, both `air_quality` will be set to 'POOR' and `heat_warning` to 'HIGH', reflecting the change caused by the intervention.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
