  "Explanation": "In the given code, 'y' is directly dependent on 'x', which itself is a product of 'data' multiplied by 5. As the 'data' increases, 'x' increases linearly, and so does 'y' because 10 is just a constant addition, making the relationship between 'data' and 'y' also a linear increase without any intervention needed.",
