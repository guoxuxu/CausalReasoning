  "Problem": "Described above in text section.\",\n\nIf the reported activity is 'hiking', and we then cool down the environment significantly, can we infer the mood was initially 'bored'?",
  "Explanation": "The only condition under which 'hiking' is chosen is if it's not hot, the mood is 'bored', and there is more than 2 hours available. By cooling the environment making it not hot, and seeing 'hiking' still occurs, it supports the inference that the initial condition included a 'bored' mood since temperature and available time are controlled.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
