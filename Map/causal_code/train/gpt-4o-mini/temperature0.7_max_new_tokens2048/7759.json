  "Explanation": "Manually increasing water and light safely above their respective thresholds (water > 50 and light > 75) results in a growth rate increase by at least 5, as described in the growth rate update function. This is an isolated, direct intervention on water and light leading to higher growth rate, regardless of unchanged nutrient levels.",
