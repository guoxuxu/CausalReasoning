  "Problem": "Python code provided above.\",\n\nAssuming an intervention where 'calculate_pollution_index' is modified to double the weights of each pollutant, and 'issue_alert' subsequently shows a 'Moderate Alert', does this necessarily mean pollutant levels were moderate prior to the change?",
  "Explanation": "Doubling the weights in the pollution index calculation could inflate the index values artificially, possibly causing moderate level alerts even if pollutant concentrations are relatively low.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
