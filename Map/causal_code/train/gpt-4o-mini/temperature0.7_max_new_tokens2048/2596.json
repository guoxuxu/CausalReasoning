  "Explanation": "The higher return value could also happen if the flag is set to 'B' where the maximum of data minus 5 could still be larger than any individual data element, especially if the maximum value is by a significant margin the largest. Therefore, a higher output does not uniquely identify the cause as 'flag' set to 'A'.",
