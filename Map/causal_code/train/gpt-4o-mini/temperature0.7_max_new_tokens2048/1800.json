  "Explanation": "Because 'base_score' is influenced by multiple factors like 'years_of_experience', 'years_of_unemployment', 'age', and whether the individual has a degree, it's not possible to attribute an increase in 'base_score' specifically to changes in 'age' without additional data on the other contributing factors.",
