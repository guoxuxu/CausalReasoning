  "Explanation": "Allowing the refueling of negative fuel amounts could potentially corrupt the logic that decreases the fuel level with each drive. If this decrease results in non-negative values erroneously, it would allow the car to be driven more frequently without the usual restraint of reducing the fuel level to zero.",
