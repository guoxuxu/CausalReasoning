  "Explanation": "Increasing the number of predators increases the predator_consumption_rate, which leads to more prey being consumed, reducing the prey population. The causal path is straightforward from the increase in predators to a decrease in prey through natural predator-prey dynamics.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If resources are greater than 50, the growth rate of prey increases; if resources are less than or equal to 50, the growth rate of prey decreases. The number of predators affects their consumption rate of resources, which in turn decreases the available resources. A higher number of predators leads to a higher death rate among them if they exceed 30. Additionally, an increase in prey results in an increase in the predator population.",
