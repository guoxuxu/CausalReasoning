  "Explanation": "Removing one year from the loop means one less year of compounding, which typically would lower the balance compared to with the year included. However, increasing the 'annual_rate' counteracts this by raising the balance more significantly each year. The overall effect would need calculation to determine if it's higher, but typically increasing the rate can offset the loss from one less year of compound interest.",
