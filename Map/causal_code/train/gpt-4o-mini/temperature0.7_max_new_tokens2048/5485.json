  "Problem": "def update_inventory(sales, restock):\n    inventory = 100\n    for sale in sales:\n        inventory -= sale\n    for item in restock:\n        inventory += item\n    return inventory\",\n\nIf 'restock' amount is fixed, does increasing 'sales' always reduce the 'inventory'?",
  "Explanation": "With no change in the 'restock' amount, the only variable affecting the inventory is 'sales'. Therefore, an increase in sales will result in a decrease in inventory, as each sale reduces the inventory count.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
