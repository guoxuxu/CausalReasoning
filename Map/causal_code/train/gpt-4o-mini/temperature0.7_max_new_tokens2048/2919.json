  "Explanation": "A true isLungProblem status indicates high likelihood of exposure and high cigarette count, but it's not definitive for counts strictly greater than 10 without knowing smoke exposure status. Both isSmokeExposure and high cigarette count (more than 10) are preconditions for isLungProblem to be true.",
