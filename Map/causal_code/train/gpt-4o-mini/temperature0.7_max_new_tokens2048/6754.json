  "Explanation": "Initially, increasing the number of students would indeed affect the student-teacher ratio as per the formula in 'calculateStudentTeacherRatio' method. However, without adjusting the number of teachers, the change in ratio is temporarily altered until 'adjustTeachersBasedOnStudents' is applied.",
