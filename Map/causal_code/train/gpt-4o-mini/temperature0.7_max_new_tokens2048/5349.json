  "Explanation": "The resetCart method sets itemCount to 0. If itemCount is already 0 prior to calling resetCart, calling this method will not change the state of itemCount as it is already 0. Therefore, intervening to set itemCount to 0 doesn’t affect the subsequent call to resetCart in changing itemCount's state.",
