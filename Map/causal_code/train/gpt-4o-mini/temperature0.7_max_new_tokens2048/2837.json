  "Problem": "{\n    \"Description\": \"A Python function that models a simple inventory management system which processes orders and adjusts inventory levels based on the availability of the item. If an item is not available, it marks the order as pending.\",\n    \"Code\": \"\"\"\ndef process_order(item_id, quantity, inventory, pending_orders):\n    available = inventory.get(item_id, 0)\n    if available >= quantity:\n        inventory[item_id] -= quantity\n        print(f'Order processed for {quantity} of item {item_id}.')\n        return 'processed'\n    else:\n        pending_orders.append((item_id, quantity))\n        print(f'Order pending for {quantity} of item {item_id}.')\n        return 'pending'\n\n# Example usage:\ninventory = {'item1': 5, 'item2': 10}\npending_orders = []\nresult = process_order('item1', 3, inventory, pending_orders)\n\"\"\"\n  },\n\nAssuming subsequent adjustment of pending orders, can this decrease be indicative of increased inventory?",
  "Explanation": "Processing and subsequently removing orders from the pending_orders list typically occurs after an increase in inventory, indicating that the inventory has been replenished.",
