Higher economic indicators suggest market stability, impacting growth depending on the temperature.\"\n  },\n\nIf an intervention sets the economic indicator to 90, will the business observe High Growth?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the economic indicator to 90 ensures market stability but does not guarantee High Growth if the temperature is not also above 20. Therefore, without knowing or controlling the temperature, High Growth isn't assured.",
