  "Explanation": "If the `tax_bracket` changes from 'low' to 'high', it suggests that the `income` which initially qualified for the 'low' bracket (i.e., 30000 or less), must have increased above 30000. Although the exact initial income is unknown, we can infer that it was <= 30000 before an increase led to reclassification.",
