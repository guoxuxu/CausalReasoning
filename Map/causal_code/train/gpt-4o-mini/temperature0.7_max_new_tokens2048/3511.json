  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, base_demand, economy_boost):\n    if discount >= 20:\n        demand_increase = 15\n    elif discount >= 10:\n        demand_increase = 10\n    else:\n        demand_increase = 5\n\n    adjusted_demand = base_demand + demand_increase\n    if economy_boost:\n        adjusted_demand *= 1.1\n\n    revenue = adjusted_demand * (price * (1 - (discount / 100)))\n    return revenue\",\n\nIf the 'revenue' increased significantly while the 'price' remained constant, did the 'base_demand' increase?",
  "Explanation": "With a constant price, a significant increase in revenue indicates an increase in the total units sold, which can be attributed to an increase in adjusted_demand. Since 'economy_boost' and 'discount' are not specified as changed, the likely factor contributing to the increase in demand would be the 'base_demand'.",
