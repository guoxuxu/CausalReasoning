  "Explanation": "A maximum observed growth rate of 3 implies optimal conditions met for water, sunlight, and temperature. Given the temperature threshold for optimal growth is narrow (20-25 degrees Celsius), observing this rate indicates the temperature would have been adjusted to fall within this range.",
