  "Explanation": "Applying more sophisticated data cleaning techniques would presumably remove more erroneous or outlier values, leading to a dataset that better represents the underlying distribution. This cleaner dataset, when passed through the 'analyze' function, would produce a more accurate average, establishing a causal pathway from the cleaning process to the accuracy of the results.",
