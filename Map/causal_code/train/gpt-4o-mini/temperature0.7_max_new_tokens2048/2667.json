  "Explanation": "An empty output list implies that no even numbers were processed; however, this does not necessarily mean the input list contained only odd numbers — it could also have been simply an empty list. So, an empty output list does not guarantee the input consisted of only odd numbers. Other inputs could have produced the same effect.",
