  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 105 explicitly meets the condition in the 'increaseTemp()' method where the temperature exceeding 100 leads to the reaction rate being doubled. As this is a direct condition in the code, intervening to set the temperature to 105 will result in doubling the reaction rate as per the logic defined.",
