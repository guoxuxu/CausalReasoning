  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, rate_increase, special_deal, day_of_week):\n    if day_of_week == 'Monday':\n        new_prices = {item: price * 1.05 for item, price in prices.items()}\n    else:\n        new_prices = {item: price * (1 + rate_increase) for item, price in prices.items()}\n    if special_deal:\n        new_prices = {item: price * 0.9 for item, price in new_prices.items()}\n    return new_prices\",\n\nIf 'rate_increase' is modified, will 'new_prices' change without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Modifying 'rate_increase' directly impacts the calculation of 'new_prices' on days other than Monday. As 'rate_increase' alters the scale factor applied to prices (1 + rate_increase), any change in 'rate_increase' will influence 'new_prices' accordingly.",
