  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, promo_code):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if promo_code == 'SAVE10' else 0.2 if promo_code =='SAVE20' else 0\n    return total * (1 - discount_rate)\",\n\nWill changing the 'promo_code' from 'SAVE10' to 'SAVE20' result in a greater discount applied to the total?",
  "Explanation": "The code defines different discount rates based on the promo code. Changing the promo code from 'SAVE10' to 'SAVE20' will increase the discount rate from 0.1 to 0.2, thus increasing the discount.",
