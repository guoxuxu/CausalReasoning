  "Explanation": "Although the heating is turned on when the temperature is below 18, the absence of a temperature reading ('temperature' not in data) leading to the default 'heating_on' value being False is not considered when the heating is on. Thus, we cannot definitively conclude that the temperature was below 18 just because the heating is on; there might be other reasons (such as manual override or changes not captured in the code).",
