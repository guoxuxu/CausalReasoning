  "Explanation": "The 'transformed_data' list scales each element of 'data' by 5. The 'data_sum' is the sum of these scaled numbers, and 'final_value' depends directly on 'data_sum' being greater than 100 or not. Larger input numbers increase 'data_sum', hence increasing the likelihood of 'final_value' being greater.",
