  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, season):\n    if season == 'holiday':\n        discount_rate += 0.05\n    final_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate)\n    tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate\n    total_price = final_price + tax_amount\n    return total_price\",\n\nAssuming we observe the total price to be identical to the base price, can we conclude after intervening on the tax rate to make it zero that discount rate was also zero?",
  "Explanation": "Under the intervention where the tax rate is set to zero (thus making tax_amount = 0), observing the total price equal to the base price implies that the final_price must also equal the base price, which can only happen if the discount rate is zero (since final_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate)).",
