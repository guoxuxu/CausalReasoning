  "Explanation": "Manipulating the final output of `process_data()` to always be 100 breaks the dependency on its earlier processes including `remove_noise()`. So, changes in `remove_noise()` will not be observable in `process_data()` under this setup, thus preventing any causal inference about `remove_noise()` based on the manipulated result of `process_data()`.",
