  "Explanation": "Setting y constant and increasing x could potentially shift the function's outcome from returning a to b (if the influence of the intervention causes c to exceed 10), which generally means a larger output value due to different computation (a = x + y, b = 2(x + y)). However, because the relationship and output depend heavily on whether c crosses 10, solely increasing x with fixed y does not guarantee that all smaller original x and y values would produce a lesser output, especially around the threshold where outputs switch from a to b.",
