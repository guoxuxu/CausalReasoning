  "Explanation": "According to the code, the systemOn condition is set to true when the externalTemperature is below the desiredTemperature and the system is currently off. This direct dependency shows that raising the desiredTemperature above the externalTemperature causes the systemOn to switch to true, assuming no other changes or interventions.",
