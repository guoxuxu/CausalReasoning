  "Explanation": "While an increase in the variance of 'e' would increase the variance in 'y', the reverse is not necessarily true. Increases in variance of 'y' could also arise from changes in 'x' or even from other unobserved factors in the environment. Therefore, increase in variance of 'y' alone cannot conclusively indicate the cause as the increase of 'e'.",
