  "Problem": "class TrafficSystem { constructor(weather, dayOfWeek) { this.weather = weather; this.dayOfWeek = dayOfWeek; } calculateTraffic() { if (this.weather === 'rainy') { return this.dayOfWeek === 'Monday' ? 'high' : 'medium'; } else { return this.dayOfWeek === 'Monday' ? 'medium' : 'low'; } } } const system = new TrafficSystem('sunny', 'Monday'); const traffic = system.calculateTraffic();\",\n\nIf the traffic prediction is 'medium', can we assume the day must be 'Monday'?",
  "Explanation": "Traffic being 'medium' can occur in two scenarios: either it is 'Monday' with 'sunny' weather, or it is not 'Monday' with 'rainy' weather. Therefore, knowing that the traffic prediction is 'medium' does not uniquely determine that the day is 'Monday'.",
