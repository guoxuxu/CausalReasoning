  "Explanation": "Even if `risk_factor` is set to a uniform value across all data as an intervention, this does not necessarily imply that `age` was uniform. The uniform `risk_factor` in this scenario is an imposed condition, independent of the actual distribution or modification of `age` values within the `clean` function.",
