  "Explanation": "When the external temperature decreases to less than 18 degrees, the condition in the 'update_temperature' method will trigger the heater to turn on (self.heater_on = True). Consequently, the internal temperature will increase by 2 degrees. Therefore, a decrease in external temperature directly causes an increase in internal temperature without any interventions.",
