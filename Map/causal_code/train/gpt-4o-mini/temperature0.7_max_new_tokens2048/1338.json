  "Explanation": "`isWet()` will return true if it is both rainy and cold. The `increaseTemperature(5)` could potentially make the temperature greater than 15 degrees, but since `isWet()` returned true, this means that both the cold and rainy conditions are satisfied. Given that the temperature factor could have been influenced (though in this instance it was not enough), the only unaltered condition remaining to be true due to initial state must be that it was rainy.",
