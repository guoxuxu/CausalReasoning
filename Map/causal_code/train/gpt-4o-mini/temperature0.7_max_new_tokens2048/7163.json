  "Explanation": "Manually setting the 'current_month' variable to 'December' within the 'detect_season_effect' method will directly lead to a seasonal effect of 100 being added to the base sales, as specified by the conditions in the method. This intervention specifically targets the causal relationship between month and seasonal sales effect.",
