  "Explanation": "A low result could occur under either condition. With the 'filter' flag, if all data points are non-positive, the sum would be zero. With the 'no_filter' flag, low or negative values in the data can also produce a low result after halving the sum. Hence, low result alone does not imply which flag was used.",
