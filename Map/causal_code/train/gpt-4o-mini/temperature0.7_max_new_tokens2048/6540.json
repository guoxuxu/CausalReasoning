  "Explanation": "While higher new sales can be influenced by an increased marketing budget, the presence of a 'random_factor' in the 'increase_sales' function means that new sales can also increase due to this random variable. Therefore, we cannot confirm an increased marketing budget solely based on higher sales without knowing the value of the random factor.",
