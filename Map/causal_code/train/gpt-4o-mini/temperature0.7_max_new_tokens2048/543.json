  "Explanation": "Setting the rainy condition to true but increasing the temperature above 20 degrees violates the bad weather condition of temperature being less than 20. Hence, it will not result in bad weather.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
