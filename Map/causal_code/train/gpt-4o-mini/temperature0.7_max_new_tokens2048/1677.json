  "Explanation": "Setting 'is_new_user' to true doubles the 'bonus', which directly adds more to 'final_score' than it would otherwise (assuming all else remains constant). The intervention manipulates the causal chain by increasing an intermediary ('bonus'), thus generally increasing the 'final_score'. This is a cause-to-effect scenario with intervention.",
