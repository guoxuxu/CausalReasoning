  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, tax_rate, discount, quantity):\n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate\n    discount_amount = price * discount\n    final_price = (price + tax_amount - discount_amount) * quantity\n    return final_price\n\nsales = calculate_sales(100, 0.07, 0.05, 50)\",\n\nIf the final sales value decreases, was this necessarily because the discount rate increased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in the final sales value could be due to several factors such as an increase in the discount, a decrease in the price or quantity, or a decrease in the tax rate, not just an increase in the discount rate.",
