  "Explanation": "Removing the 'age' field means 'is_adult' key will not be added as its condition won't be fulfilled. This results in the 'credit_score' key not being computed since it relies on the 'is_adult' key. Consequently, 'loan_approval', which depends on 'credit_score', will not be calculated.",
