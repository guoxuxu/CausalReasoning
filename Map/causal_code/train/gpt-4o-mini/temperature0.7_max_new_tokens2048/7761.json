  "Explanation": "The output of feels_like() will only change if the humidity exceeds 80. If the increase is within a range below 80, the output, which is the adjusted temperature, will remain unaffected. Thus, an increase in humidity does not necessarily increase the 'feels like' temperature unless it crosses the threshold of 80.",
