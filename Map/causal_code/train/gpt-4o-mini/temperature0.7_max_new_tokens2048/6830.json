  "Explanation": "Increasing the thermostat setting above the current room temperature triggers the heating system ('on'), which in turn increases the room temperature by 5 degrees. Thus, without any other intervention, increasing the thermostat_setting leads to an increase in room_temperature if the initial room_temperature is below the new thermostat_setting.",
