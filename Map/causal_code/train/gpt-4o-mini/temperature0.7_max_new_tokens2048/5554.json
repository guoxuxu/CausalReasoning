  "Explanation": "The significant reduction in output size upon adding an extra compression step suggests that the original `compress_data` was not fully optimizing the size reduction. This indicates that other factors or functions besides `compress_data` were contributing to size management, and performance was not solely reliant on the original compression functionality.",
