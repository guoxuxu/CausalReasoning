  "Explanation": "A decrease in the outcome of final_price() can suggest that a discount was applied. Since the discount directly decreases the base_price, which is used in calculating the final price, observing a decrease in final_price() allows the inference that a discount might have been applied, showing causal inference from effect back to presumed cause.",
