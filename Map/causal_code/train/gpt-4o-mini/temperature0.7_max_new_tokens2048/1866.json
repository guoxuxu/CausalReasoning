  "Explanation": "A lower 'average_age' might suggest problems in how 'age' data is being processed or cleaned in 'clean_data' such as incorrect filling of missing values or data type errors. The function directly manipulates 'age' data which directly affects the 'average_age' calculated in 'analyze_data'.",
