  "Explanation": "Without intervention, observing a traffic speed of 30 km/h implies high traffic density (greater than 50). According to the code, this speed is set only if it is not a holiday and `trafficDensity` is 50 or higher, following the `else` condition in `calculateTrafficSpeed()` method.",
