  "Explanation": "A final price lower than expected could suggest several things including an increase in the discount. Altering the discount directly affects the discounted_price and thus final price; hence, a lower final price could be due to an increased discount. This analysis requires understanding reverse causality with intervention (assumptions on how other variables like base_price or tax_rate might have changed).",
