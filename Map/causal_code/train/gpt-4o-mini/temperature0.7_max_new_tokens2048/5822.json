  "Explanation": "The health status 'Moderate' combined with a high diet quality implies, by intervention in understanding age, that the person must be 30 years or older as both criteria need to be satisfied according to the code logistics. This reverses from knowing the effects (health status, high diet quality) to deducing the cause (age).",
