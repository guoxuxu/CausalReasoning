  "Explanation": "While changing the passing threshold can lead to more students passing, the increase in passing students alone is not sufficient to conclusively determine that it was due to a change in the passing threshold. Other variables such as improvements in teaching methods, easier exams, or even errors in grade assignment could also account for the increased pass rate.",
