  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, discount, season):\n    if season == 'summer':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.9\n        else:\n            return price\n    elif season == 'winter':\n        if discount:\n            return price * 0.8\n        else:\n            return price * 1.1\n    else:\n        return price\",\n\nIf we introduce a mandatory 10% discount regardless of the season, will the sales depend on the season?",
  "Explanation": "Even with a mandatory discount, the final sales price still varies by season as the amount by which the price is reduced from the original differs between 'summer' and 'winter'.",
