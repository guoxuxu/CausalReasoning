  "Explanation": "While 'adjusted_data' depends on 'adjustment', a change in 'adjusted_data' might also result from changes in the input 'data' or its 'normalized' value. Several factors can influence 'adjusted_data' independently of 'adjustment'.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
