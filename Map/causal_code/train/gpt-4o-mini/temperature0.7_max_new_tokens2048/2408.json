  "Problem": "{\n    \"Description\": \"In a fictional program, the system increases the heat or cooling based on a desired temperature set.

  "Explanation": "An increase in fan speed can be due to increased temperature_difference from various factors not just changes in the desired_temperature, such as natural changes in actual_temperature. There is no direct inference that can reliably link fan speed increase to higher desired_temperature setting without other contextual information.",
