  "Explanation": "By maintaining temperature above zero, the only condition left for umbrella usage driven by the function willPeopleUseUmbrellas() depends on whether it is raining. Since the artificial maintenance of temperature eliminates the freezing condition, any instance of rain will logically result in people using umbrellas.",
