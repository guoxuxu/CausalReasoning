  "Explanation": "The total price is a result of the prices of all products and the current discount rate, but adjusting the total price calculation itself (e.g., by directly setting a different total) does not affect the discount rate. Any change in total price seen via the 'getTotalPrice' method does not intrinsically alter the discount rate, as these are calculated values, not causal inputs.",
