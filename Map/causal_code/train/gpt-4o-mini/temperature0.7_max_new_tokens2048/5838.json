  "Explanation": "An increase in health does not necessarily imply prior sickness or the use of effective medicine. The health might have improved due to other reasons not detailed in the code (such as natural recovery or other non-coded interventions). Hence, this causal relationship cannot be determined solely based on the observed increase in health.",
