  "Explanation": "Under normal circumstances, lowering the 'growth_rate' should decrease 'future_sales'. If 'future_sales' increases even after a decrease in 'growth_rate', it suggests some form of intervention, possibly by altering 'sales_data' directly (e.g., correction of data, application or reversal of discounts).",
