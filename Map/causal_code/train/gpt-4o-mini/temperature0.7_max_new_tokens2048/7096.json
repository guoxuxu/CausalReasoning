  "Explanation": "A reduction in the number of patients may result in a decrease in the number of doctors through the manage_resources function if the total number falls below 30. This summarizes a feedback mechanism from the effect (patient count reduction) leading to a causal adjustment (decreasing doctor numbers).",
