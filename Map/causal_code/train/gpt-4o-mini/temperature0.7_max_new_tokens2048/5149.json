  "Explanation": "Enhancing the train_model function to implement more effective training algorithms can potentially improve the model's general accuracy by producing better 'weights' based on the data available. This intervention directly targets the mechanism producing the model, and a more accurate model generally equates to higher scores in the validation phase, assuming all other code architecture remains unchanged.",
