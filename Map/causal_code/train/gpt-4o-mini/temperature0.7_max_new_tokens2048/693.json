  "Explanation": "In this particular setup, a salary increase is conditional on John's performance rating being above 80, and it increases by a specific rate (10%) only when this condition is met. Therefore, an increase in salary is a direct indicator that John's performance rating was high enough to trigger this adjustment.",
