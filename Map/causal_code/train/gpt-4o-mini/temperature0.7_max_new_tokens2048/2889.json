  "Explanation": "If checkIfTrafficIsAllowed() returns true, it indicates that isGreen is true. However, it is not certain that this was due to calling operateTrafficLight with true since isGreen could have been set by calling setTrafficLightGreen() directly or through other manipulations. Initial presumption of isGreen being false doesn’t sufficiently confirm the operation through operateTrafficLight with true, without more context or logs.",
