  "Explanation": "Several factors can lead to a decrease in 'result' such as reductions in data variability or an alteration in preprocessing steps not specified (e.g., filtering outliers). Without precise information on what intervention was made on 'data', a decrease in 'result' does not conclusively point to a specific pre-averaging transformation change.",
