  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(sales, costs, economy_factor):\n    sales_increase = sales * (1 + economy_factor / 100)\n    expenses = costs * (1.05)\n    profit = sales_increase - expenses\n    return profit\n\n# Example usage\neconomy_factor = 3\nsales = 150000\ncosts = 50000\nprofit = compute_metrics(sales, costs, economy_factor)\",\n\nIf economy_factor increases, will profit necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'profit' is a function of 'sales_increase' which positively correlates with 'economy_factor'. Hence, increasing 'economy_factor' leads to increased 'sales_increase', and consequently higher 'profit', assuming no other variables change.",
