  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention: A reduction in revenue could be due to an increase in `discountRate` via the `applyDiscount` method, a decrease in `salePrice` via `updatePrice`, or a reduction in `unitsSold`. Without additional information, one cannot definitively attribute the reduced revenue to an increase in `discountRate` alone.",
