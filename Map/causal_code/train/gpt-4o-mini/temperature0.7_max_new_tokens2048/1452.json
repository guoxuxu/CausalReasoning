  "Explanation": "A decrease in temperature doesn’t necessarily indicate that the 'decrease' action was chosen; the environmental temperature might have naturally changed due to factors that are not considered in the function, or the action could still be 'increase' but other factors not reflected in this function could have lowered the temperature more significantly.",
