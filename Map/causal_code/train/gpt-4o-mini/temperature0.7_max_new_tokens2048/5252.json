  "Explanation": "A higher temperature can result from either the weather being cold and having the heating turned on (50 + 20 = 70) or from the weather not being cold and having the heating turned on (70 + 20 = 90) or even not cold without heating (70). Therefore, a higher temperature is not exclusively due to cold weather.",
