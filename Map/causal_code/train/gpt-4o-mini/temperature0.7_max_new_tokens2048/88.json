  "Explanation": "The absence of change in 'new_inventory' can occur because the increase in 'units_sold' was exactly equal to the increase in 'current_inventory', balancing out the effects even if 'units_added' is zero. Thus, not observing a change in the effect does not necessarily indicate the absence of the cause.",
