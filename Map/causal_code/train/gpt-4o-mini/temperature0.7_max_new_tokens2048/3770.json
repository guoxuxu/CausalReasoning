  "Explanation": "As per the function, persons older than 50 have a lower base health index of 70, compared to 90 for those 50 or younger. Thus, as age increases beyond 50, the `health_index` decreases due to the reduced base value, assuming other factors (diet_quality and exercise_freq) remain constant.",
