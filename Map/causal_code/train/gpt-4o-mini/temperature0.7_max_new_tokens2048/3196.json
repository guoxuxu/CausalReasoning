  "Explanation": "Setting the hour below 12 leads to a temperature increase (temperature += 3), which moves the temperature away from the threshold for rain (temperature < 20). Any rainy weather, in this case, could not have resulted due to the hour update and must have other causes or initial conditions that aren't covered directly by this action.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
