  "Explanation": "The weather status 'Rainy and cold' comes only under the condition that 'isRaining' is true, which is set only when the 'updateWeather' method receives the 'rain' flag as true. Additionally, the 'Rainy and cold' status implies a temperature reduction potentially due to being less than 10 degrees initially.",
