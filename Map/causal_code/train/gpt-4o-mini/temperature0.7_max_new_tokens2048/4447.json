  "Explanation": "The method willPeopleUseUmbrellas directly checks if the weather is 'rainy' through the isRainy method. If 'rainy' is set as the weather, isRainy returns true, hence willPeopleUseUmbrellas also returns true.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
