  "Problem": "{\n    \"PythonCode\": [\n      \"def calculate_costs(quantity, base_cost, transport_cost):\",\n      \"    total_cost = (quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost\",\n      \"    if quantity > 50:\",\n      \"        discount = 0.1 # 10% discount\",\n      \"        total_cost = total_cost - (total_cost * discount)\",\n      \"    return total_cost\"\n    ]\n  },\n\nIf 'quantity' increases, will 'total_cost' necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "Although increasing quantity normally raises costs due to higher base costs, surpassing a quantity of 50 triggers a discount, potentially lowering or stabilizing the total cost despite higher quantities.",
