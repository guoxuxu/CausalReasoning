  "Problem": "{\n    \"python\": \"import random\ndef foo(x):\n  y = x * 10\n  if y > 50:\n    z = y + 20\n  else:\n    z = y - 20\n  return z\ndef main():\n  x = random.randint(1, 10)\n  result = foo(x)\n  print('Result:', result)\nmain()\",\n    \"description\": \"The function `foo` takes an integer `x`, multiplies it by 10 to get `y`, and depends on `y`'s value to either add or subtract 20 to get `z`. The main function generates a random number between 1 and 10, calls `foo` with this number, and prints the result.\"\n  },\n\nAssuming the function has been changed to always add 20 to `y`, can observing a lower `z` conclusively indicate a lower `x` was used?",
  "Explanation": "With the modification to always add 20 to `y`, `z` directly reflects changes in `x` because it becomes a function only of `x` (`z = x * 10 + 20`). A lower `z` means `z` was calculated with a lower `x`.",
