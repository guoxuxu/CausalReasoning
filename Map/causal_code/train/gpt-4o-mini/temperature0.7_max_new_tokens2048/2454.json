  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total_price = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == 'SAVE10' else 0.05 if coupon_code == 'SAVE5' else 0\n    discount = total_price * discount_rate\n    final_price = total_price - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final_price is observed to increase, can it be concluded that all item prices were increased?",
  "Explanation": "While increasing the item prices can lead to a higher final_price, other factors such as changes in the quantity of the items or changes in the discount rate (different coupon codes or no coupon codes) could also result in an increase in final_price.",
