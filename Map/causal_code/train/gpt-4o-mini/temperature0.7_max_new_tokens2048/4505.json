  "Explanation": "Altering the temperature alone might not necessarily reflect a change in the 'is_comfortable' status. The 'is_comfortable' output is a function of both adjusted_temperature and humidity; although the adjusted_temperature might be impacted by a manipulated increase in temperature, humidity plays a crucial role. Unless humidity is below 50, the comfort level might not be deemed comfortable even if temperature conditions are met.",
