  "Explanation": "If 60 items are sold from a stock of 100, the stock will fall to 40. With the intervention to restock whenever stock falls below 50, an additional 30 units would be added making the stock 70. However, since the stock did drop below 20 at one point, the system's method will trigger an order.",
