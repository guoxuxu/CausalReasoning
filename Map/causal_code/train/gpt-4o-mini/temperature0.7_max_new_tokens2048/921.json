  "Explanation": "While 'isHeating' being false typically indicates that the system is not heating and potentially that the 'currentTemperature' is at least 'setTemperature', it does not definitively mean that 'currentTemperature' has reached 'setTemperature' because 'isHeating' could be initially false even if 'currentTemperature' is below 'setTemperature'.",
