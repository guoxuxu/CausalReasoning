  "Explanation": "An intervention through the 'sleep()' method adds hours to 'sleepHours' and potentially reduces 'heartRate' if sleeping hours reach or exceed 8. This reduction in heart rate can change the 'isAtRisk' status, especially if high heart rate and insufficient sleep were contributing factors. This illustrates how an effect (change in risk status) can be manipulated through a cause (more sleep).",
