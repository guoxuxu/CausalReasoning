  "Explanation": "Even when marketing spend is constant at $500, changing the season to 'summer' increases the base demand by 7 units (from 3 in other seasons to 10 in summer). This increase in demand directly contributes to an increase in revenue, as price and other factors remain constant. The increase is solely due to the increased number of units sold, because of the seasonal effect on demand.",
