  "Explanation": "Applying 'SAVE10' provides a discount of 10, which is subtracted from the product of ‘base_price’ and ‘quantity’. This decreased taxable amount subsequently lowers both the tax and the final 'total' compared to a scenario where no discount is applied. Since the intervention explicitly reduces the 'taxable_amount', it also reduces the 'total'.",
