  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code=None):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == '10OFF' else 0.05 if coupon_code == '5OFF' else 0\n    discount = total * discount_rate\n    total_after_discount = total - discount\n    return total_after_discount\",\n\nIf the total cost before discount appears high, can we infer coupon_code was '10OFF'?",
  "Explanation": "A high total cost before discounts simply reflects the sum of products of 'price' and 'quantity' of the items. It does not inherently indicate the usage of any particular coupon code, as the coupon code affects only the discount rate and subsequently the total cost after discount.",
