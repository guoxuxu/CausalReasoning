  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, stock, discount_factor):\n    if discount_factor > 0.5:\n        discount = price * 0.10\n    else:\n        discount = price * discount_factor\n    final_price = price - discount\n    total_sales = final_price * stock\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf the discount_factor increases, will total_sales necessarily increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount_factor does not necessarily result in higher total_sales. If the discount_factor exceeds 0.5, the discount is capped at 10% of the price, limiting the final_price reduction and potentially the increase in total_sales.",
