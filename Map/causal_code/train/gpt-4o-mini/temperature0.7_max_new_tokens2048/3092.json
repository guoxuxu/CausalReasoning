  "Explanation": "Setting 'smoker' status to 1 indeed increases the risk factor by 2 units, but the final risk factor also depends on the age of the person. If after recalculating, the total risk factor stays 5 or below, the insurance premium would still be 1200. Thus, setting the smoker status to 1 does not necessarily lead to a premium of 2000.",
