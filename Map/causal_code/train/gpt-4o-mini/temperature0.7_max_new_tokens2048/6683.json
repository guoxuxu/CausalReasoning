  "Explanation": "The code specifies that a person will receive a salad only if they have an allergy and are not over 20 years old. Thus, receiving a salad enables us to infer the presence of an allergy (as well as being 20 or younger), noting that all persons who receive a salad in the provided conditions must have an allergy.",
