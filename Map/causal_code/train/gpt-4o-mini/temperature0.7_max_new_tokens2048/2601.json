  "Explanation": "Changing the 'result' to 'hot' without naturally passing through the if condition does not provide reliable information about the original temperatures as the alteration bypasses the logical condition of the code. Hence, we can’t infer that the original temperatures all exceeded 75 based on the forced result.",
