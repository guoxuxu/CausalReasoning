  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  updated_data = data * 2\n  final_data = updated_data + 10\n  return final_data\n\nresult = process_data(input_data)\",\n\nIf it is observed that subtracting 10 from 'result' does not change its value, did 'input_data' start as zero?",
  "Explanation": "The function process ends with adding 10 to 'updated_data' to get 'final_data', which is returned as 'result'. If subtracting 10 from 'result' yields no change, it means the resultant data returned was originally zero (result = 0). Given the data processing steps (multiplication by 2, then addition of 10), this implies the only way for 'final_data' to be 0 after these operations is if 'updated_data' was also 0, hence 'input_data' must have been 0 before the multiplication.",
