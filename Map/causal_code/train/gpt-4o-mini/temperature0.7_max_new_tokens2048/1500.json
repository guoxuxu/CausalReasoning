  "Explanation": "While initial salary setting logic in the constructor indicates that managers start with a salary of 5000, an employee's salary can also be increased to 5000 or above through other methods such as the `updateSalary` function. Therefore, a salary of 5000 alone does not conclusively indicate that the employee is a manager.",
