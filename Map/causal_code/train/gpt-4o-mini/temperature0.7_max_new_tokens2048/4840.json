  "Explanation": "While the trigger for rain is a temperature below 20 degrees when it is already not raining, the `setTemperature` method shows that rain will stop if the temperature reaches 30 degrees or above. This means rain can occur in other situations where temperature changes do not bring it below 20, or rain could have started prior and continued despite a temperature above this threshold.",
