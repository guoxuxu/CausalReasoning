  "Explanation": "Modifying 'total_sales' directly influences the computation of 'average_sales' when 'compute_average_sales' is executed, as 'average_sales' is calculated using the value of 'total_sales' divided by the length of 'sales_data'. Therefore, any manual intervention changing 'total_sales' will affect 'average_sales' upon recalculating.",
