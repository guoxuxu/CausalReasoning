  "Explanation": "The absence of zero entries in 'processed_data' simply means that all normalized data points were greater than the threshold set in 'apply_filter'. It does not indicate that the 'normalize' function did not perform division, as its role is to divide each data point by the maximum value, not to determine whether they exceed the threshold.",
