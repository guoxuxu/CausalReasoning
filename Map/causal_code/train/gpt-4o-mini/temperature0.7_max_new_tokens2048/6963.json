Herbivores eat the plants and are also affected by the presence of predators.\",\n    \"code\": \"sunlight = 5\nwater = 3\nplants = sunlight * 2 + water\ncount_herbivores = (plants - 5) // 2 if plants > 5 else 0\ncount_predators = 1 if count_herbivores > 5 else 0\n\",\n    \"variables\": {\n      \"sunlight\": \"Amount of sunlight, affects plant growth linearly.\",\n      \"water\": \"Amount of water, affects plant growth linearly.\",\n      \"plants\": \"Total plant growth, affected by sunlight and water.\",\n      \"count_herbivores\": \"Number of herbivores, based on plant availability.\",\n      \"count_predators\": \"Number of predators, depends on the number of herbivores.\"\n    }\n  },\n\nDoes an increase in the number of predators indicate an increase in the number of herbivores?",
  "Explanation": "The presence of predators is conditioned to there being more than 5 herbivores. Thus, if there are more predators, it indicates that there were enough herbivores to trigger their presence.",
