  "Explanation": "In the process_data function, a 'Low' return value occurs when 'result' is not greater than 50. The 'result' value is derived from the compute_score function which directly reflects the normalized input processed by the normalize function. Since compute_score returns 80 if the input normalized value is above 70 and 40 otherwise, a result less than 50 means the normalized value was below the threshold of 70 needed to get a score of 80.",
