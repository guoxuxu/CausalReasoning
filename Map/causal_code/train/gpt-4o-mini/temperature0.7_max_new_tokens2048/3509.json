  "Explanation": "With humidity set to zero, w becomes 0, meaning the result solely depends on z, which is directly calculated from the temperature with a consistent factor (either 0.9 or 1.1). A very low result implies that z (and hence the temperature) must also be low because there is no other contributing factor to the result.",
