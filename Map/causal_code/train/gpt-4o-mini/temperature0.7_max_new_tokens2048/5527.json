  "Explanation": "When the user's age is updated to 18, the method `check_adult_status` will set `is_adult` to True as the user becomes an adult. Then, `update_subscription_status` explicitly checks if the user is an adult and doesn't have an active subscription, which leads to `offer_discount` being called with a percentage of 10. Thus, this results in the user's discount changing.",
