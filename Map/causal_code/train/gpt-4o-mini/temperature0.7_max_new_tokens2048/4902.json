  "Explanation": "Reducing `room_temp` via an intervention doesn’t necessarily relate to the state of `heater_on`. The room temperature could be manually decreased regardless of the heater's state. Thus, the manipulation of `room_temp` does not provide definitive information about interventions on `heater_on`.",
