  "Explanation": "Observing discounted prices around 90% of original prices indicates a discount rate close to 0.1 (since 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 or 90%) as set in the code for summer. While prices themselves might vary, the percentage indicates a discount rate typical of summer according to the given code.",
