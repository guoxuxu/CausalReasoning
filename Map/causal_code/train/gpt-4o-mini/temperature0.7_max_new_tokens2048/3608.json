  "Explanation": "Changing the normalize function affects how 'value' is divided—increasing the divisor decreases the resultant normalized value passed to compute_score. Since compute_score multiplies the input by 100, reducing the normalized value would lead to lower scores overall, impacting resulting classifications ('High' or 'Low').",
