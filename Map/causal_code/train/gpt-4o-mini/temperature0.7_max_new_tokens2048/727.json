If 'invest_more' is found to be False, can it be concluded the business wasn't profitable to begin with?",
  "Explanation": "Given the hypothetical intervention that sets 'invest_more' to False for profitable businesses, the status of 'invest_more' being False cannot conclusively determine the unprofitability of the business. Under the new policy, profitable businesses will also have 'invest_more' set to False, confusing the original causal connection.",
