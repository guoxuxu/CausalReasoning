  "Explanation": "A smaller return value is based on returning a, which happens when c (b - 3) ≤ 10. However, since b is calculated as (x + y) * 2, x and y could sum to values less than or equal to 6.5 approximately, (since (6.5 * 2) - 3 = 10) which is a larger range than just '10 or less'. Therefore, the return value being less than or equal to 10 does not conclusively indicate that the sum of x and y was 10 or less.",
