  "Explanation": "While applying a discount does lower the price, a reduction in price could also be due to other factors not mentioned (e.g., strategic re-pricing, competitive responses). Thus, without additional information specifically about interventions like discounts, we cannot conclusively infer that a discount was applied just by observing a reduction in price.",
