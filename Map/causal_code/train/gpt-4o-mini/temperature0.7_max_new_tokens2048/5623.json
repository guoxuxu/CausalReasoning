  "Explanation": "From cause to effect without intervention: Increasing the base_price increases the tax_amount since it is directly proportional to the base_price. Although the discount_amount would also increase if has_discount is True, the increase in the base_price still results in an overall increase in final_price because the discount is a subtraction based on the percentage of the base_price.",
