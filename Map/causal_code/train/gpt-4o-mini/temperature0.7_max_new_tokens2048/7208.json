  "Problem": "def process_order(product_id, quantity):\n    stock = check_stock(product_id)\n    if stock >= quantity:\n        update_stock(product_id, quantity)\n        log_activity(product_id, quantity)\n    else:\n        print('Insufficient stock for product', product_id)\",\n\nIf you see that the log_activity consistently shows 'Insufficient stock' messages, can we conclude that the stock level for that product is zero?",
  "Explanation": "From effect to cause with intervention, seeing 'Insufficient stock' messages only indicates that at the time of each order, stock was less than the order quantity. It does not necessarily mean that stock is zero; stock could be less than what was ordered but not necessarily depleted completely.",
