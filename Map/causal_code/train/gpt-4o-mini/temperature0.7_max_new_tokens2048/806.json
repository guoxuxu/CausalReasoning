  "Problem": "def compute_sales_data(prices, discounts, tax_rate):\n    final_prices = [(p - p * d) for p, d in zip(prices, discounts)]\n    tax_amounts = [fp * tax_rate for fp in final_prices]\n    total_sales = sum([fp + ta for fp, ta in zip(final_prices, tax_amounts)])\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf the government implements a policy to reduce the tax rate, will this intervention likely increase the total sales?",
  "Explanation": "Reducing the tax rate decreases the overall cost to the consumer for each product, assuming no other changes in prices or discounts. This could potentially increase consumer purchasing power and lead to an increase in total sales, given the price elasticity of demand.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
