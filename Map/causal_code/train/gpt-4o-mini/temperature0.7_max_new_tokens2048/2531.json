  "Explanation": "According to the original code, when a person's age exceeds 50, the healthScore is reduced by 30 points in the updateHealthScore function, which is automatically called in the constructor when an instance is created. Increasing the age from 49 to 51 crosses this threshold, thus triggering the decrease.",
