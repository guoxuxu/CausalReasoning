  "Problem": "def compute_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount = 0\n    if coupon_code == '20OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.2\n    elif coupon_code == '10OFF':\n        discount = total * 0.1\n    return total - discount\",\n\nIf the final payable amount is significantly less than expected, can we conclude that a '20OFF' coupon code was definitely used?",
  "Explanation": "While using a '20OFF' coupon code reduces the payable amount, concluding that it was definitely used is not certain. The reduced payable amount could also be due to other potential changes such as pricing errors, misreported quantities, or even a different coupon code providing a similar or larger discount. The causality can't be determined without other information validating the use of the specific coupon.",
