  "Explanation": "By setting the temperature above 20 degrees (ensuring comfort) and making it sunny (ensuring a happy mood), both main factors affecting satisfaction are optimized. This setting guarantees that any increase in the number of visitors will proportionally increase visitors_satisfaction since both other factors encourage the highest satisfaction ratio (0.9).",
