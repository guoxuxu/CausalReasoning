  "Explanation": "Altering the temperature to 25 before the condition check ensures that the temperature no longer exceeds the 30-degree threshold required to set the status to 'too_hot'. Therefore, even if the original temperature was higher than 30, this intervention prevents the status from becoming 'too_hot'.",
