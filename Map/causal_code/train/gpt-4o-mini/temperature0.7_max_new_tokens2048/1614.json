  "Explanation": "Though an increased stock level might lead one to think that reorder amount was increased, the original code does not provide such a dynamic allocation capability within the manage_inventory function without manual intervention. A higher end-of-day stock could also be due to lower sales or original higher stock; not necessarily because of increased reorder amount.",
