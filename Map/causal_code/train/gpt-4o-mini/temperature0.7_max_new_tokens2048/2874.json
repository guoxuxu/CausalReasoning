  "Explanation": "Setting 'holiday' to True triggers the condition to multiply 'sales_total' by 1.1, thus increasing it before applying the discount rate to get 'discounted_total'. This is a direct influence from the cause (holiday being True) to the effect (increased 'discounted_total') without any intervention.",
