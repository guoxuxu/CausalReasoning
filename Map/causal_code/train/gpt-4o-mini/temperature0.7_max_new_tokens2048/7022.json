  "Explanation": "The function `decide_outfit` determines the outfit based on whether it is rainy, which is defined as a temperature below 20 degrees in the `Weather` class. Therefore, if the temperature is below 20, `Weather.is_rainy()` will return True, leading to the choice of a raincoat.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
