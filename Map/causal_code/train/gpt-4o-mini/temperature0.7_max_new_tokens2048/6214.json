  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, promo_code):\n    total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if promo_code == 'SAVE10' else 0.2 if promo_code =='SAVE20' else 0\n    return total * (1 - discount_rate)\",\n\nIf the final payment is less than expected, can this suggest that an additional discount was applied beyond the promo code?",
  "Explanation": "A lower final payment than calculated strictly based on the promo code implies additional modifications post promo code application, such as further discounts or errors in initial price entries.",
