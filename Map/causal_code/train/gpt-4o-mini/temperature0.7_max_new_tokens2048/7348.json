  "Explanation": "With 'factor' fixed at 1.5 and output being True, this demonstrates that the current 'original' and the intervened 'factor' combination results in a 'result' greater than 50. Increasing 'original' would increase 'adjusted' and 'result' further, making it even more likely for the output to be True.",
