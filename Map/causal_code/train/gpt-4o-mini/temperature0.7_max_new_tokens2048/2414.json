  "Explanation": "Once the conditional subtraction is removed, every change in 'result' correlates directly to a change in 'data_input' because the only operation left relates 'warmed_data' directly with 'data_input' through a linear equation, dependent on 'data_input'. As a result, the function becomes a simple linear transformation of 'data_input', so a decrease in 'result' directly indicates a decrease in 'data_input'. Therefore, by this intervention, we can ascertain changes in 'data_input' based on observing changes in 'result'.",
