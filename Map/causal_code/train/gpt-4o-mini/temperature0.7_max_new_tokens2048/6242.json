  "Explanation": "If the automatic transmission status of cars is manually set regardless of their built-in properties (such as fuel efficiency or brand), then determining a car’s brand based on the transmission alone isn't plausible. The manual intervention disrupts the natural relation where only fuel-efficient cars might have this feature applied using the standard method.",
