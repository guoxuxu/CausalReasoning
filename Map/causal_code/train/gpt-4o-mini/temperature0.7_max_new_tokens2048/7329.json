  "Explanation": "The total_sales is directly influenced by the ad_budget due to the formula: total_sales = base_sales * seasonal_multiplier + ad_budget * 0.3. As ad_budget increases, total_sales will increase proportionally by 0.3 times the increase in ad_budget, assuming other factors remain constant.",
