  "Problem": "def environment_simulation(temp, policy, energy_demand):\n    if temp > 30:\n        air_quality = 'Poor' if policy == 'Weak' else 'Moderate'\n    else:\n        air_quality = 'Good'\n    power_production = energy_demand * 1.1 if temp < 20 else energy_demand * 0.9\n    return air_quality, power_production\",\n\nObserving a decline in power production, can it be concluded that this was caused by a decrease in daily energy demand?",
  "Explanation": "The power production formula in the code shows that production is influenced by both energy demand and temperature. A decline in power production could be due either to a decrease in energy demand or an increase in temperature (above 20 degrees, where power production efficiency decreases). Hence, a direct causal link from a decline in power production solely to a decrease in energy demand cannot be established without additional information on temperature.",
