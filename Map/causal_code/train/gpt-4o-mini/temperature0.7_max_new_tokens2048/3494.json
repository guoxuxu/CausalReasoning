  "Problem": "class RoomController {\n  int temperature = 20;\n  boolean heaterOn = false;\n\n  public void increaseTemp() {\n    heaterOn = true;\n    temperature += 5;\n  }\n\n  public void decreaseTemp() {\n    if (heaterOn) {\n      heaterOn = false;\n    }\n    temperature -= 3;\n  }\n\n  public String checkStatus() {\n    if (heaterOn) {\n      return \"Heater is on and temperature is \" + temperature;\n    } else {\n      return \"Heater is off and temperature is \" + temperature;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf the method increaseTemp() is called, will the temperature always be greater than 20?",
  "Explanation": "Calling increaseTemp() sets heaterOn to true and increases the temperature by 5. Since the initial temperature is 20, increasing it by 5 results in a temperature of 25, which is always greater than 20. This demonstrates from cause to effect without intervention.",
