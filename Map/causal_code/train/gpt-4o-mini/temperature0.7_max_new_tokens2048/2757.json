  "Problem": "def sales_forecast(hours_worked, ad_budget): \n  productivity = hours_worked * 0.5\n  ad_effectiveness = ad_budget * 0.3\n  total_sales = (productivity + ad_effectiveness) * 1000 \n  return total_sales\",\n\nKnowing the total sales, can we uniquely determine the hours worked if we fix the advertising budget?",
  "Explanation": "Even with a fixed advertising budget making ad_effectiveness constant, the total sales result from the sum of productivity and a constant. Multiple combinations of hours worked could result in the same total sales figure due to this summation relationship, making it impossible to uniquely determine hours worked based solely on total sales.",
