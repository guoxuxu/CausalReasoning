  "Explanation": "When the temperature exceeds 30, the code sets the 'status' key in the data dictionary to 'too_hot' as per the condition specified. There are no other conditions affecting the 'status' when the temperature is considered, hence the status will always be 'too_hot' when temperature > 30.",
