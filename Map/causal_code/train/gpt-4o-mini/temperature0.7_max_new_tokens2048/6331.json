  "Explanation": "Sunny weather leads to an increase in steps (between 8000 and 12000), which likely results in a health boost (if over 10000 steps, health increases by 10). Increased health above 60 results in the person being happy. So, there is an increased likelihood of happiness with sunny weather.",
