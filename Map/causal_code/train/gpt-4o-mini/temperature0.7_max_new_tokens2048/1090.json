The total sale price is calculated based on the unit price, quantity, available discounts, and whether a promotion is applied. The constructor initializes the variables and the total is calculated with these given parameters. This code exemplifies dependencies between variables such as when a promotion affects the discount applied.\"\n  },\n\nIf we set hasPromo to true and adjust the discountRate, will this change the outcome of the calculateTotal method?",
  "Explanation": "Setting hasPromo to true makes the condition inside calculateTotal method active, which applies the discountRate to the total amount. Adjusting the discountRate while hasPromo is true will directly affect the discount applied and therefore alter the total calculated.",
