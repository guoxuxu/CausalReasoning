  "Explanation": "Decreased 'future_sales' could result from various factors. 'Growth_rate' is one factor but it might also be influenced by changes in data (e.g., due to 'apply_discount' or changes in original sales) and the number of projected years. Thus, a direct decrease in 'future_sales' doesn't necessarily imply a reduced 'growth_rate' alone.",
