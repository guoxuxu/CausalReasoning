  "Problem": "def compute_values(temp, pressure):\n    boiling_point = 100 + (pressure - 1) * 0.5\n    if temp > boiling_point:\n        state = 'Gas'\n    elif temp == boiling_point:\n        state = 'Transition'\n    else:\n        state = 'Liquid'\n    return state\",\n\nAssuming we know the state changed to 'Liquid', can we conclude that the temperature or pressure was directly manipulated?",
  "Explanation": "If the state is 'Liquid', it implies the temperature is less than or equal to the boiling point. Any change to this state from 'Gas' or 'Transition' implies either temperature was reduced or pressure was modified to alter the boiling point, thus a direct manipulation of one or both factors is necessary for this change.",
