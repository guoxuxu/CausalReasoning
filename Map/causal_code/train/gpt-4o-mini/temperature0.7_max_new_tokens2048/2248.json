  "Explanation": "A value less than 100 could be because the Heal method was never called, or it might also be due to the TakeDamage method reducing health to below 100 subsequently even after healing. Without additional information (such as initial health or subsequent method calls), we cannot conclusively infer the non-calling of the Heal method.",
