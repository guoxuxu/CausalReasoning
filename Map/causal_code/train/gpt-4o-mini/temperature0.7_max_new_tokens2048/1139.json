  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'result' can result from either a decrease in 'rainfall' or a decrease in 'fertilizer' or both. Without specific information about changes in 'rainfall' or 'fertilizer' through intervention details, we cannot conclusively say that 'rainfall' has decreased.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
