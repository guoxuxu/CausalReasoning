  "Explanation": "While lower temperatures are associated with cloudiness, due to randomness in temperature setting for cloudy conditions (10 to 19), temperatures just below 20 but not exclusive to cloudy conditions can occur if randomness in non-cloudy conditions provides a value at the extreme lower end of 20 to 34.",
