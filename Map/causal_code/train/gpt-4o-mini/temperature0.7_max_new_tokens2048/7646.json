  "Explanation": "Under the code conditions, either it's rainy, or it's sunny with a high COVID spread rate (>5). Both these scenarios lead to a masking requirement. Since you mention the gathering size to be 50, we infer it's sunny with high spread rate, thus masks are indeed required.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Weather conditions influence the maximum gathering allowed and whether masks are required. Specifically, rainy weather leads to a maximum gathering of 10 people and requires masks, while sunny weather with a covid spread rate greater than 5 allows a maximum of 50 people and also requires masks. Additionally, a sunny weather condition with a covid spread rate of 5 or lower permits a maximum gathering of 100 people without requiring masks. Hence, the maximum gathering directly affects mask requirements.",
