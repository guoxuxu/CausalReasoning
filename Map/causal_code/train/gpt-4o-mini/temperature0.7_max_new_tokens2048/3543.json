  "Explanation": "Since user2's high health risk can be reasoned from low activity level (derived from user2 being inactive and older than 30) and a diet quality of 6 (which fits the moderate but not the severe low-quality diet condition), you can infer that the age over 30 contributes to the high health risk, though the primary driver is their low activity level combined with a modestly low diet quality.",
