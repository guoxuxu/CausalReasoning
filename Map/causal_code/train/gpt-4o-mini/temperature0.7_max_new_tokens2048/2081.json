  "Explanation": "Even though there's a dependency, final_result is influenced by processed_input, which in turn depends on raw_input. However, without specific evidence that raw_input was changed or processed differently (such as an indication in the code that it has decreased directly affecting the final_result), one cannot conclusively state that changes in raw_input led to the change in final_result. Other factors like modifications in process_data could also affect the final result.",
