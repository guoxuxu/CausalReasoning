  "Problem": "class WeatherSystem {\n    int windSpeed = 10;\n    int airPressure = 100;\n    boolean isRaining = false;\n\n    void updateWeather(int newWindSpeed, int newAirPressure) {\n        windSpeed = newWindSpeed;\n        airPressure = newAirPressure;\n        if (windSpeed > 15 && airPressure < 95) {\n            isRaining = true;\n        } else {\n            isRaining = false;\n        }\n    }\n}\",\n\nBy observing that it is not raining, can we manipulate the wind speed to confirm if the air pressure is above 95?",
  "Explanation": "While knowing it's not raining provides information that either one or both conditions are not satisfied, manipulating wind speed alone cannot conclusively determine the air pressure, because lack of rain only tells us that not all conditions for rain are present but does not specify which one.",
