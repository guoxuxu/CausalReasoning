Specifically, if a person is older than 50, smokes, or has diabetes, they are at a higher risk for heart disease. Starting smoking increases the smoking status, while getting diabetes increases the diabetes status. Applying treatment can lead to stopping smoking, which in turn can update the risk of heart disease.",
