  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'price' directly increases 'revenue' if 'sales' are constant ('revenue' = 'sales' * 'price'). Consequently, a higher 'price' would make it easier to surpass the 1000 revenue threshold, thus switching the 'category' to 'High'. This intervention on the 'price' facilitates achieving a high category through its direct impact on revenue.",
