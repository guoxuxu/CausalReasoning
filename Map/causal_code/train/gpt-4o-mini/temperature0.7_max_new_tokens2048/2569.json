  "Explanation": "In the `updateWeather` method, using an umbrella during rainy conditions changes the deltaTemperature adjustment. Specifically, deltaTemperature is modified to cool down or warm up slightly depending on its original value. This is an intervention (using an umbrella) causing a direct effect on the temperature.",
