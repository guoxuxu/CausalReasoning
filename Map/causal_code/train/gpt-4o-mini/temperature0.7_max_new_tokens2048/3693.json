  "Explanation": "Preventing rain can be achieved by ensuring clouds do not form, since the presence of clouds is a prerequisite for rain. Therefore, interventions aimed at preventing rain, such as manipulating temperature or humidity to inhibit cloud formation, lead to a direct conclusion that clouds did not form.",
