  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(prices, season, coupon_code):\n    if season == 'Summer':\n        discount_rate = 0.1\n    elif season == 'Winter':\n        discount_rate = 0.2\n    else:\n        discount_rate = 0.05\n\n    if coupon_code:\n        extra_discount = 0.05\n    else:\n        extra_discount = 0.0\n\n    final_prices = [price * (1 - (discount_rate + extra_discount)) for price in prices]\n    return final_prices\",\n\nIf a coupon code is applied, will the final prices decrease irrespective of the season?",
  "Explanation": "The application of a coupon code adds an extra discount of 0.05 to the existing discount rate, which reduces the final prices regardless of what the season is.",
