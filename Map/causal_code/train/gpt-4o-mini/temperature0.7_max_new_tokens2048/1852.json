  "Explanation": "If the order value is observed not to have doubled, under the assumption that input parameters (i.e., quantity) remain consistent post-intervention, it can be inferred that the user has not been upgraded to membership. The code defines that member's orders are doubled, hence unchanged values suggest no membership upgrade.",
