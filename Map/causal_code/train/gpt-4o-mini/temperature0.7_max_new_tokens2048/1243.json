  "Explanation": "Observing a decrease in temperature might suggest that 'decrease_temperature' was used, but other factors like manual setting of the temperature or external temperature impacts could be the cause. Without explicitly controlling for these factors, we cannot confidently conclude that 'decrease_temperature' was the cause of the lower temperature.",
