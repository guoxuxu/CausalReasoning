  "Explanation": "Increases in interest rates do not directly increase unemployment. Rather, higher interest rates typically decrease inflation, and this adjusted inflation rate influences the unemployment rate, which actually tends to decrease as per the formula used (10 - interestRate * 0.5) which results in lower unemployment with higher interest rates.",
