  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, holiday): \n    if holiday: \n        discount_rate *= 1.5 \n    total_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate) \n    tax_amount = total_price * tax_rate \n    final_price = total_price + tax_amount \n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the base_price increases, will the final_price also increase without any other changes?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the base_price leads to a corresponding increase in total_price, holding other variables constant. Since final_price is based on total_price (and scaled by tax and discount factors), it logically follows that an increase in base_price results in an increase in final_price.",
