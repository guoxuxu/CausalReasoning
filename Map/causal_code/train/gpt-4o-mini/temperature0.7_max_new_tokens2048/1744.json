  "Problem": "def calculate_prices(base_price, discount, tax_rate):\n    discounted_price = base_price - (base_price * discount)\n    final_price = discounted_price + (discounted_price * tax_rate)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we increase the tax_rate, will the final_price increase, assuming we keep the base_price and discount constant?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the tax_rate raises the amount of tax added to the discounted_price. Since discounted_price is derived from a constant base_price and discount, any increase in tax_rate directly increases the final_price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
