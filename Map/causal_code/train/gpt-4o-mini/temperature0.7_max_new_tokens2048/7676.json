  "Explanation": "Given the conditional logic in `getWeatherStatus()`, if the weather returns as 'Sunny', it is clear that it is not raining and the temperature is at least 20 degrees Celsius. Therefore, after an intervention that changes the conditions to 'Sunny', the temperature must be above 20 degrees.",
