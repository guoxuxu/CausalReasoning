  "Explanation": "Age itself, in the provided code, does not directly influence the BMI calculation or the health risk category. While age-related factors can influence weight or muscle/fat ratio (thereby impacting BMI indirectly), the code strictly uses weight and height to calculate BMI. Therefore, aging without changes in weight or height does not alter the health risk category.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
