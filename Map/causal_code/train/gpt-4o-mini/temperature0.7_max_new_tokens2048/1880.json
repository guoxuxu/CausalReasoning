  "Explanation": "Although calling 'turnOffEngine' sets 'speed' to 0, it's not possible to definitively conclude that 'turnOffEngine' was called just because 'speed' is 0. The vehicle might have never had the engine turned on in the first place, or the initial speed could have been 0 even if the engine was never turned on.",
