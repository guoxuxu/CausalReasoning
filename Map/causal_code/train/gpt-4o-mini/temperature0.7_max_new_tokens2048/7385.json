  "Explanation": "Since the rate directly influences the number of new infections each day (new_infections = self.infected * self.rate), an increase in the rate will proportionally increase daily new infections, cumulatively leading to a higher total number of infections by the end of the simulation period, provided the population size remains constant and without other interventions.",
