  "Problem": "{\n    \"python\": \"import random\ndef foo(x):\n  y = x * 10\n  if y > 50:\n    z = y + 20\n  else:\n    z = y - 20\n  return z\ndef main():\n  x = random.randint(1, 10)\n  result = foo(x)\n  print('Result:', result)\nmain()\",\n    \"description\": \"The function `foo` takes an integer `x`, multiplies it by 10 to get `y`, and depends on `y`'s value to either add or subtract 20 to get `z`. The main function generates a random number between 1 and 10, calls `foo` with this number, and prints the result.\"\n  },\n\nIf `x` is increased, will `z` always increase?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing `x` increases `y` (since `y = x * 10`). However, whether `z` increases depends on whether `y` crosses the threshold of 50, causing the conditional logic to switch from subtracting to adding 20, or vice versa.",
