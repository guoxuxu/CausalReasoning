  "Explanation": "A very high variance is indicative of a wide spread of the data. If the 'clean' flag had been set, many extreme values (outliers) would likely have been removed, potentially reducing the variance. Thus, high variance suggests that the data might not have been cleaned (i.e., the 'clean' flag was not set).",
