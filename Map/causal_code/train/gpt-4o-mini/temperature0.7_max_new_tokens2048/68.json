  "Problem": "class Experiment {\n  int temperature;\n  int pressure;\n  boolean result;\n  public Experiment(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.2); // Assumes pressure is dependent on temperature\n    this.result = this.pressure > 100; // Result is true if pressure is greater than 100\n  }\n  public void setTemperature(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.pressure = (int) (temperature * 1.1); // Changing the dependency formula here\n    this.result = this.pressure > 110; // Also changing the threshold for result\n  }\n}\",\n\nKnowing the result turned true after setting the temperature to 95, can we deduce that the initial temperature setting methodology was still in place?",
  "Explanation": "Given the pressure-recalculation and the new threshold for the result set in `setTemperature`, the fact that the result is true after the intervention does not necessarily imply that the initial temperature-to-pressure calculation was still used. The new setting could be in place, and new conditions met.",
