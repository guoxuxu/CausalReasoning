  "Explanation": "Introducing a minimum expense limit can potentially reduce the performance scores if it forces higher expenses without a proportional increase in sales. Since the ROI is dependent on the ratio of net profit to expenses, increasing expenses while keeping sales constant or not adequately increasing will lower performance scores.",
