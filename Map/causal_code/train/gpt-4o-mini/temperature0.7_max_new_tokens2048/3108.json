  "Explanation": "The `drive` method in the code decreases the fuel level by 1 unit every time it's called, if the engine is on. When the fuel reaches zero, the engine status is automatically set to 'off' with a corresponding message. Thus, observation of the engine turning off after being on indicates the car has run out of fuel.",
