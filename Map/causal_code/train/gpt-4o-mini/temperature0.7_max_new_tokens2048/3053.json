  "Explanation": "An increase in healthy population percentage suggests recovering or preventing illness, rather than the result of a new pandemic. A pandemic increase results in a higher ill population, opposite to the observed effect of increasing health percentage; thus, it cannot be concluded that such a pandemic occurred based on this rise in health.",
