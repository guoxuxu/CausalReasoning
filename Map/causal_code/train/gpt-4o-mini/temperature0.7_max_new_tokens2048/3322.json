  "Explanation": "The method 'updateWeather' adjusts the temperature by the 'deltaTemp' parameter. If 'deltaTemp' is not zero, then the temperature will change from its initial state of 20 degrees. The lack of rain only ensures that the temperature does not set to 5 under rainy and cold conditions, but other changes through 'deltaTemp' affect the temperature.",
