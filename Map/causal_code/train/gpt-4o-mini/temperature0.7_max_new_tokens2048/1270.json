  "Explanation": "Turning off the heater decreases the current temperature by subtracting 5 from the environment temperature. If the status is 'Too cold', it implies the current temperature is already below the set point. Turning off the heater would further lower the temperature, making it less likely to reach 'Perfect'.",
