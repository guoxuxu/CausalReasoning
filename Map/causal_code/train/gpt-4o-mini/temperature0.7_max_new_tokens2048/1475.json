  "Explanation": "Increasing the temperature could lead to a change in the weather status from 'rainy' to 'sunny' if the temperature originally was on the threshold and the humidity remains unchanged. This change in weather status directly affects the predicted activity from 'indoor activities' to 'picnic'.",
