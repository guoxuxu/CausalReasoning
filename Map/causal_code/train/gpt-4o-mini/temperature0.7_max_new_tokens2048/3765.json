  "Explanation": "Considering the 'update_weather' logic, rainfall is prevented by temperatures below zero regardless of humidity. Thus, if 'is_raining' is manually set to False and it remains not raining despite high humidity, it suggests the temperature may indeed be below zero, as this condition overrides the humidity check.",
