  "Explanation": "Although 'modified_data' is initially calculated as 'data * 2' and exceeding 25 at the end suggests that the original 'data' could have been more than 10, the addition of 5 to 'modified_data' regardless of the initial 'data' size means we cannot be certain of the exact value of the initial 'data'. For example, an initial 'data' of 10 would also lead to a 'modified_data' of 25 after addition, making it indeterminate if 'data' was greater than 10 solely based on the final value of 'modified_data'.",
