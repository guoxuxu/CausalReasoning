  "Explanation": "When `cost_increase` is 0 and `demand_rising` changes from False to True, `production_units` shifts from `50 + 0//2` to `100 + 0`. This change increases `production_units` from 50 to 100, reflecting a direct implication of increasing `demand_rising` with controlled `cost_increase`.",
