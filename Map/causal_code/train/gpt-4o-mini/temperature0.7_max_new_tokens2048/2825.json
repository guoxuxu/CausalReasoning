  "Explanation": "While setting the cloud cover to 'high' can increase the rain probability to 75, other factors such as changing humidity directly could also affect the probability. The increase to 75 might be due to direct adjustments in humidity or combined settings in cloud cover and humidity, and not solely because of cloud cover intervention.",
