  "Explanation": "While significant reductions in final_prices suggest a possible increase in the loyalty score above the 5 point threshold, it's not a certain conclusion. Without direct intervention or additional data on the loyalty_score, we cannot rule out other factors, such as potentially lower original prices or external code changes affecting discount computation. Direct manipulation or additional context about the loyalty_score is required for certainty.",
