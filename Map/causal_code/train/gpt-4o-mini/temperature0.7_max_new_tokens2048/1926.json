  "Explanation": "Low performance is derived when systemLoad is greater than 50. Although enabling debugMode can increase the load, low performance might also be due to high systemLoad from other factors unrelated to debugMode. Thus, low performance does not necessarily imply that debugMode was set to true, indicating a non-exclusive causal relationship when deducing from effect to cause without intervention.",
