  "Problem": "def compute_scores(data):\n    age_adjustment = data['age'] * 0.1\n    experience = data['years_of_experience'] - data['years_of_unemployment'] * 0.5\n    base_score = 70 + experience + age_adjustment\n    if data['has_degree']:\n        base_score += 15\n    return base_score\",\n\nIf 'years_of_experience' increases, do you expect 'base_score' to also increase, assuming other factors remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "More years of experience directly contribute to a higher 'experience' value in the calculation of 'base_score'. Since 'experience' is added directly to the 'base_score', increasing 'years_of_experience' increases 'base_score', assuming all other inputs remain unchanged.",
