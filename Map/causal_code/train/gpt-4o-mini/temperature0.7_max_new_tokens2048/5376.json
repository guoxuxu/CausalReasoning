  "Explanation": "The adjust_temperature method is automatically invoked during a room_check, which attempts to turn the heater on if the temperature is below 20 degrees. However, if an intervention occurs where the heater is manually disabled, the automatic control flow is overridden regardless of temperature conditions.",
