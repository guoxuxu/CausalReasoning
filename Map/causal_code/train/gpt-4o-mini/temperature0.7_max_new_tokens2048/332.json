  "Explanation": "A higher than expected 'final_price' could be influenced by the absence of a coupon, but it could also result due to the 'customer_type' being 'regular' instead of 'premium', or other factors not introduced in the code. Thus, only knowing the price is higher does not conclusively dictate that 'has_coupon' was set to false due to an intervention without further context.",
