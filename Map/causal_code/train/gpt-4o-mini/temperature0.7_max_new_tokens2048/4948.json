  "Explanation": "While forecasted_sales is a dependent variable calculated from current_sales, base_sales and advertising_budget, inverse determination isn't guaranteed due to the presence of multiple independent variables affecting the outcome. Changes in advertising_budget, even when forecasted_sales is known, affect the ability to pinpoint an exact original current_sales.",
