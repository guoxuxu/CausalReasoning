  "Explanation": "When 'isRainy' is set to true, the method 'calculateComfortIndex' applies a larger deduction from the temperature (temperature - 5) and calculates a larger part of the humidity (humidity / 10) to subtract. This results in a lower comfort index compared to when 'isRainy' is false, hence the comfort index decreases.",
