  "Problem": "def calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, bonus_percentage):\n    taxes = gross_salary * tax_rate\n    bonus = gross_salary * bonus_percentage\n    net_salary = gross_salary - taxes + bonus\n    return net_salary\",\n\nIf the net salary is observed to increase, can we definitely say the gross salary increased, assuming tax rate and bonus percentage remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "While an increase in gross salary can cause an increase in net salary, they are not directly reversible because other factors in the formula (like a decrease in tax rate or an increase in bonus percentage) could also lead to an increase in net salary. Thus, net salary increasing does not definitively mean that gross salary also increased.",
