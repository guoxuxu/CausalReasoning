  "Explanation": "Although reconnection using server.connect() leads to a successful email send, a successful email operation on its own does not imply that reconnection was performed just before it. The server might have been already connected by default or from previous operations. Other factors (like server being initially connected) could also result in the email being sent and cached.",
