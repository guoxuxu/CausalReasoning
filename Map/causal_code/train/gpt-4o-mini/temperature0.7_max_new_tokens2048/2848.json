  "Explanation": "Setting the heater on when the current temperature is significantly lower than the desired temperature will activate the condition in the 'update_temperature' method that increases the current temperature. This action (turning the heater on) intervenes in the system to raise the current_temp, moving it closer to the desired_temp.",
