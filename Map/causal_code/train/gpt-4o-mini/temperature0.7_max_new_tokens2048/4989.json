  "Explanation": "Introduction of a price cap would act as an upper limit. However, since the price is determined by `max(0, demand-supply)`, which then scales by market conditions (`1.2x` or `0.8x`), an increase in demand would still raise the price towards this cap before hitting the limit, thus reflecting the increased demand.",
