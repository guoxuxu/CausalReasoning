  "Explanation": "A 'High Risk' category generally indicates a high computed health risk score, which, without the modifying effect of exercise being specified, suggests that either age, weight, or both are significantly contributing to the increased score.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
