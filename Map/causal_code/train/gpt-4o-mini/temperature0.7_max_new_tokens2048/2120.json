  "Explanation": "Since 'corrected' is set to False solely under the condition where 'status' contains 'error', this attribute being False implies that 'error' was indeed in the 'status'. The code does not provide any other path to set 'corrected' to False, thereby establishing a strong link from effect back to its cause without intervention.",
