  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(items, coupon_code):\n    total_price = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n    discount_rate = 0.1 if coupon_code == 'SAVE10' else 0.05 if coupon_code == 'SAVE5' else 0\n    discount = total_price * discount_rate\n    final_price = total_price - discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the coupon_code is 'SAVE10', will the final_price be lower?",
  "Explanation": "Since the discount rate for coupon code 'SAVE10' is 0.1 (10%), this leads to higher discount amounts being subtracted from the total price, resulting in a lower final price.",
