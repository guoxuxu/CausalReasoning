  "Explanation": "A drop in consumer confidence could result from an automatic update in the interest rate (due to low global influence) or a manual intervention setting a lower rate. However, consumer confidence can also decrease naturally as per its adjustment method if the interest rate simply remains below or equal to 4—without necessarily implying a drop or any specific level of global influence at the last update.",
