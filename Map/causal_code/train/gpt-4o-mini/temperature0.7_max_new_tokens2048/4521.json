  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  int temperature;\n  boolean isRaining;\n\n  WeatherSimulator(int temperature) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.isRaining = false;\n  }\n\n  void updateWeather() {\n    if (this.temperature < 10) {\n      this.isRaining = true;\n    } else {\n      this.isRaining = false;\n    }\n  }\n\n  void increaseTemperature(int increment) {\n    this.temperature += increment;\n    updateWeather();\n  }\n\n  void decreaseTemperature(int decrement) {\n    this.temperature -= decrement;\n    updateWeather();\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf you manually increase the temperature, will it stop raining?",
  "Explanation": "Using the increaseTemperature method triggers an increase in temperature and subsequently calls updateWeather. If the temperature rises above 10, updateWeather will set isRaining to false. Thus, any manual increase leading to a temperature above 10 degrees will stop the rain.",
