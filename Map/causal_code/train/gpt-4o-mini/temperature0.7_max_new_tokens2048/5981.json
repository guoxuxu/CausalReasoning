  "Explanation": "Artificially increasing the temperature in Summer will push the temperature further beyond 20 degrees, if it’s not already. As the rain condition is solely dependent on the temperature being below 20 degrees in the provided system, increasing it above this threshold will ensure that it does not rain.",
