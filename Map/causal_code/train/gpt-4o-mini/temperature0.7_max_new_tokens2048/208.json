  "Explanation": "If the decision to travel is negative (False), the only condition under which this decision is reached is 'heavy' traffic. Although you can't directly observe traffic in this scenario, you can logically deduce that the traffic must have been heavy since it’s the only situation leading to a negative travel decision.",
