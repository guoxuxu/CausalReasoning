  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'bonus' will cause Charlie's score (initially 105) to exceed 100 by a higher margin (with the original implementation, Charlie ends up at 100 after deductions). With a higher initial increment, the penalty subtraction remains the same, but from a higher starting point, resulting in a greater reduction from Charlie's initial score.",
