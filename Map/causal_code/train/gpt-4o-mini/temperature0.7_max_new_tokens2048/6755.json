  "Explanation": "A change in the student-teacher ratio could be due to either a change in the number of students or a change in the number of teachers, as highlighted by the formula in 'calculateStudentTeacherRatio.' This may come through direct modifications to student count or teacher count, or through procedural calls like 'adjustTeachersBasedOnStudents'.",
