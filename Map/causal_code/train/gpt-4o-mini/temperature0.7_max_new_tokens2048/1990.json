  "Explanation": "An average of '0' in 'result' does not imply that all entries in 'raw_data' are the same, especially considering how the data is processed. However, it reflects the characteristic of 'processed_data' after normalization and scaling, which might hypothetically suggest uniformity or zeroes post initial transformations; nevertheless, 'analyzed_data' would never practically have a zero average unless error or specific conditions are introduced, as all-original entries of '0' would still cause scaled entries to be zero across.",

The processed_data is derived from process_data, which generates normalized_data and scaled_data.

The average is determined from processed_data, and is_data_uniform checks if all entries in processed_data are the same.",
