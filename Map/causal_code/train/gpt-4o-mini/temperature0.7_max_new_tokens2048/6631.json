  "Explanation": "Without knowing the values in 'data' or 'base_value', and whether 'base_value' is greater or less than elements in 'data', it cannot be determined if 'adjust_factor' was used as multiplier or increment. Both scenarios can lead to 'processed' elements being greater than 'data' elements.",
