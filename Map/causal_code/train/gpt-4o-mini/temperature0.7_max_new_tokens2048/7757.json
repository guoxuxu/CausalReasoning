  "Explanation": "Increasing water and light levels beyond the thresholds (water > 50 and light > 75) directly causes an increase in growth rate by 5. Additional nutrients (if above 30) would increase the growth even further, but the change in water and light alone causes the growth increase regardless of the nutrient level.",
