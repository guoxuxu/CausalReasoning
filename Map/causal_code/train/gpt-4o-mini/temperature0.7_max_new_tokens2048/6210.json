  "Problem": "def update_inventory(item_sales, inventory_counts):\n    for item, sold in item_sales.items():\n        if item in inventory_counts:\n            inventory_counts[item] -= sold\n    return inventory_counts\",\n\nIf fewer items are remaining in the inventory, does it imply that an intervention requiring over 10 sales per transaction was implemented?",
  "Explanation": "A low inventory count can be due to various reasons including high volume of sales under the existing conditions without any interventions, or other operational adjustments such as restocking policies, not necessarily only due to adopting an over-10 sales per transaction rule.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
