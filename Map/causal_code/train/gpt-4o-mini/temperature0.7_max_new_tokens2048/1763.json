  "Explanation": "A higher than expected final price might also occur due to a low `discount_rate` even if `is_member` is True. Therefore, a higher final price alone does not imply that `is_member` was set to False, as multiple factors influence the `final_price`.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

  "causal_map_integration": "If a customer is a member, it causes a discount to be applied; the discount rate also influences the amount of discount given. The original price determines the discount amount, and the discount ultimately affects the final price. Hence, the final price is influenced by both the original price and the discount applied.",
