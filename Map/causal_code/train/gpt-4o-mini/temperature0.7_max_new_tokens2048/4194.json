  "Explanation": "Increasing 'base_sales' directly increases the product in the formula 'self.base_sales * multiplier', leading to a higher output from 'predict_sales' method. This represents a direct causal relationship from the cause 'base_sales' to the effect 'sales' output, without any intervention.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
