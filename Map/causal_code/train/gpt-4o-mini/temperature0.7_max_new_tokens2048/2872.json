  "Explanation": "Applying a discount reduces the 'effective_price' for customers in the loyalty program, making the price potentially fall below the 20 threshold, thus potentially increasing sales from 500 to 1000, assuming the initial price was borderline around the threshold.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
