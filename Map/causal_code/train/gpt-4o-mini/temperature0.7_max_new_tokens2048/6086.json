  "Explanation": "A higher sum could be due either to 'modify_flag' being True or simply because the 'data' elements and the 'filter_val' allowed higher values to be included in the sum. 'filtered_data' might naturally be large enough to give a higher sum irrespective of whether they are doubled.",
