  "Problem": "def process_data(data, filter_threshold):\n    filtered_data = [d for d in data if d > filter_threshold]\n    added_value = sum(filtered_data) + 10\n    return added_value\n\nresult = process_data([3, 15, 7, 22, 5], 10)\",\n\nIf the result from the process_data function is 0, can we conclude that the filter_threshold was set unusually high?",
  "Explanation": "A result of 0 indicates that the sum of filtered_data plus 10 is zero. Since this added value results from adding 10 to the sum of filtered_data, the only way this sum would end up being negative (and ultimately zero when 10 is added) is if filtered_data is empty. Thus, it is highly likely that filter_threshold was set above all data points.",
