  "Explanation": "If stock levels are externally modified, for instance, through an audit that directly changes 'self.stock_levels', any subsequent call to 'order_stock' will post the changes on top of the already modified stock levels. Thus, the effects seen in stock levels would be cumulative, reflecting both the direct adjustment (audit) and the inherent function of the 'order_stock' method.",
