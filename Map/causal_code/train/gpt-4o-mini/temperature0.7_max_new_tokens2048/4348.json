  "Problem": "def student_performance(height, study_hours, part_time_job):\n  stress_level = 0.4 * part_time_job\n  rest_quality = -0.3 * stress_level\n  study_efficiency = study_hours * (0.5 + 0.2 * rest_quality)\n  health = 0.6 * height - 0.5 * stress_level\n  performance = 0.3 * health + 0.7 * study_efficiency\n  return performance\n\n# Example invocation\nperformance = student_performance(170, 5, 1)\",\n\nSuppose performance drops significantly; does introducing stress management interventions necessarily indicate the cause for the drop was primarily stress?",
  "Explanation": "While stress is one factor influencing performance, multiple components contribute to performance including health and study_efficiency. Intervening with stress management can be an exploratory step, but it does not conclusively establish that stress was the primary cause of the performance drop without considering other factors.",
