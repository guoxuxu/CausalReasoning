  "Explanation": "An increase in final prices can be caused by several factors including higher initial prices or lower discounts, not necessarily an increase in the tax rate. The tax rates as defined in the code are fixed per region regardless of the changes in other variables.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
