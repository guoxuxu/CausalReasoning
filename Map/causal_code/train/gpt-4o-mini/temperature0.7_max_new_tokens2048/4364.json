  "Explanation": "Setting the random boolean to always true still leaves one condition dependent on the level of humidity, which is influenced by the temperature. If temperature is below or equal to 25 (and other uncontrolled aspects not causing a raise in humidity above 50), humidity remains at 40, which is below the threshold needed for rain, thus rain won't occur.",
