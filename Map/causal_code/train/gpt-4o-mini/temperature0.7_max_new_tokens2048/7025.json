  "Explanation": "In this code, t-shirts are chosen when it is not rainy, which equates to temperatures 20 degrees or more. If a t-shirt is chosen and we intervene by setting the temperature to 25 degrees, the state remains consistent with the original, non-rainy scenario, reaffirming the choice of a t-shirt.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
