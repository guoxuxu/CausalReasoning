  "Explanation": "Though the condition in the 'increaseTemperature' method sets rain to true when the temperature rises above 30, the 'setRain' method can directly set raining to false and adjust the temperature to 25, regardless of its prior value. Therefore, not raining does not necessarily imply that the temperature did not exceed 30 degrees before the intervention.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the temperature directly raises the temperature value. If the temperature exceeds 30 degrees, it causes it to start raining. Setting rain directly affects the rain status, and if it is set to not rain, the temperature is adjusted to 25 degrees. The rain status also influences the temperature, suggesting that if it is not raining, the temperature can be influenced by other factors.",
