  "Explanation": "Consumer confidence is modified in the modifyConsumerConfidence method, which alters consumer confidence based on the current interest rate. A higher interest rate (above 4) results in an increased consumer confidence. Thus, it's reasonable to infer that changes in interest rates affect consumer confidence directly.",
