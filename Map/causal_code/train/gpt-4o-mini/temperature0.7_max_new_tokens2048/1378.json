  "Problem": "class Thermostat {\n  private int temperature;\n  private boolean power;\n\n  public Thermostat() {\n    temperature = 22; // Default room temperature in Celsius\n    power = false; // Thermostat is initially turned off\n  }\n\n  public void turnPowerOn() {\n    power = true;\n  }\n\n  public void turnPowerOff() {\n    power = false;\n  }\n\n  public void setTemperature(int newTemp) {\n    if (power) {\n      temperature = newTemp;\n    }\n  }\n\n  public boolean isPowerOn() {\n    return power;\n  }\n\n  public int getTemperature() {\n    return temperature;\n  }\n\n}\",\n\nUpon observing that the temperature is at the default setting, can we conclude that an external script turned on the power and then reset it?",
  "Explanation": "The temperature being at its default setting (22 degrees Celsius) could be due to multiple reasons other than an external script intervention. It could be a result of initial object construction or the thermostat might have been reset to default settings due to other internal logic or manual operations unrelated to the external script.",
