  "Explanation": "While observing a specific decrease in 'total' indicates a discount was applied, it cannot definitively tell which specific code was used between 'SAVE10' or 'SAVE20' without additional information. Both codes decrease the total amount, but the exact discount value can be similar for different quantities of goods purchased, or different original base prices.",
