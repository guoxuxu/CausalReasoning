  "Explanation": "A reduction in total_price could be due to several reasons such as a decrease in the base_price, an increase in discount_rate, or a decrease in the tax_rate. Without specific information about these variables, it is not possible to conclusively say that the reduction was caused by applying additional discounts (an intervention).",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
