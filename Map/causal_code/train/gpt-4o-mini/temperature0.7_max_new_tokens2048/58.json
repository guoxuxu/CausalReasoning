  "Explanation": "In the decreaseHumidity method, lowering humidity directly does not always imply a decrease in temperature. However, if humidity drops below 45, it will lead to a reduction in temperature. Without knowing if the threshold was crossed, we cannot directly conclude a reduction in temperature from a decrease in humidity without additional information.",
