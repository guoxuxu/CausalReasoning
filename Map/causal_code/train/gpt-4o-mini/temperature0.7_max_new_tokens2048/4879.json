  "Explanation": "Since the function 'correct_errors' is directly responsible for fixing errors before further data processing in 'process_data', a failure to properly fix errors will affect the later stages of data cleaning and analysis, causing 'process_data' to possibly fail in turning out successfully processed data. This is a case of inferring the effects of a change in the cause without intervention elsewhere.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
