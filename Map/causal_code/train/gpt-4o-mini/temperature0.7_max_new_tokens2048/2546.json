  "Explanation": "While reducing doctors by more than 3 will decrease patient satisfaction, patient satisfaction might also decrease if the number of patients increases substantially (20 or more) due to the 'increasePatients' method. Therefore, a decrease in patient satisfaction does not specifically imply that more than 3 doctors were reduced.",
