  "Explanation": "The evaluateComfort() function first calls updateTemperature(), which, if the temperature is initially above 25 degrees, decreases the temperature by 2 degrees. Then the methodology in evaluateComfort() checks if temperature is still over 22 degrees to qualify as 'Hot'. Therefore, initially, it was likely above 25 degrees.",
