  "Explanation": "While higher activity levels in sunny weather can yield a healthy status, knowing someone's health status as 'healthy' does not definitively determine it was sunny, nor does it confirm their activity level, particularly if there were intervening changes in the weather or unaccounted for changes in activity levels.",
