  "Explanation": "Though increasing the temperature can lead to reduced humidity, the decrease in reported humidity could be purely from manual adjustments (calling adjust_humidity directly) or setting it through increase_humidity. There might be no direct relationship between the observed humidity and prior temperature changes in this scenario.",
