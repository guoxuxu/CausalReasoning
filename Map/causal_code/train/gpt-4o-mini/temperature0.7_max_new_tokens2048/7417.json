  "Explanation": "In the code, adjusted_growth is directly calculated from growth, which itself is derived by multiplying sales by 0.1. Therefore, any increase in sales will proportionally increase growth, which in turn, will increase adjusted_growth, regardless of the region due to the multipliers applied subsequently.",
