  "Explanation": "Seeing a higher adjusted_temperature does not necessarily mean the thermostat_setting was increased. It might occur because the current_temperature was previously much below the desired range, leading to an adjustment increment. The change in adjusted_temperature could also happen without any alteration in the thermostat setting, merely dependent on how the readings of the current_temperature relate to previous settings.",
