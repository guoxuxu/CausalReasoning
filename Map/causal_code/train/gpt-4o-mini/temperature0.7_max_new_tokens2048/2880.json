  "Explanation": "Adding 5 to each data item before processing (an intervention) would change the original parity of all numbers (odd numbers become even and vice versa). Therefore, the processing after this adjustment—multiplying even numbers by 10 and adding 10 to odd numbers—would not reflect the original numerical categorization.",
