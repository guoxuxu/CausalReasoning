  "Explanation": "Observation of rain indicates high cloud cover. However, if cloud cover is externally fixed at 'high', it interrupts the natural effect of temperature increase on cloud cover. Therefore, rain does not definitely imply that the temperature was below 30 degrees under these intervened conditions.",
