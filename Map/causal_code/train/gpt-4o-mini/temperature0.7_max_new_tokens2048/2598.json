  "Explanation": "If the result is twice the minimum value, it corresponds precisely to the operation defined for the case where the flag is neither ‘A’ nor ‘B’. Flag settings 'A' and 'B' involve either additions or subtractions with sum or max operations, which cannot exactly replicate the doubling of the minimum value.",
