  "Explanation": "Changing the 'max_depth' parameter limits the depth of the tree, which directly impacts the complexity of the decision boundaries the model can learn. This change can therefore influence the model's output predictions.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
