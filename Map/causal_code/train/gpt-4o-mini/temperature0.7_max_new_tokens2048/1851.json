  "Problem": "int processOrder(int quantity, bool isMember) { if (isMember) { return quantity * 2; } else { return quantity; } }\",\n\nIf we were to change a user’s status to a member, would every order necessarily have its value doubled compared to its original value?",
  "Explanation": "Changing a user’s status to 'member' triggers the conditional branch in the code that multiplies the quantity by 2, effectively doubling the value of every order processed compared to if the user were not a member. This doubling effect is explicitly defined in the code for members.",
