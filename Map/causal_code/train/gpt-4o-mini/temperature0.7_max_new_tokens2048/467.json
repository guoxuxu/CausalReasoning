  "Explanation": "Adjusting the filter_threshold to ensure at least 15 data points are included after filtering can potentially lower the threshold, incorporating more data points which might be below the previous average, this might lead to considering otherwise excluded lower data, which can affect the 'is_reliable' status based on the given condition of having more than 10 data points.",
