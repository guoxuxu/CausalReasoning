  "Explanation": "The outcome of 'just hot' or 'hot and humid' depends directly on the humidity level. If the temperature is just increased beyond 30 degrees without modifying the humidity, the weather status could be either 'just hot' or 'hot and humid' based on existing humidity levels compared to the 70% threshold.",
