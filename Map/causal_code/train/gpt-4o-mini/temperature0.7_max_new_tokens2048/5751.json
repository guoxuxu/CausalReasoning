  "Explanation": "Setting the 'factor' variable to 5 directly influences the multiplication operation in the function 'multiply_by_factor', causing the result to increase because the input number 10 is being multiplied by a greater factor than the default. This tests from cause to effect without intervention.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
