  "Explanation": "The 'update_sales_data' method directly updates the 'sales_data' list, then recalculates both total and average sales. Since 'average_sales' depends on both the total sum of sales and the count of entries in 'sales_data', updating these will directly affect the computation of 'average_sales'.",
