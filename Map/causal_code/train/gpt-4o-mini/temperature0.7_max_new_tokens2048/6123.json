  "Problem": "See code above\",\n\nIf the base price decreases by 20, will the demand increase?",
  "Explanation": "The `update_demand` function in the code increases `demand` when the `current_price` (modified by a discount which lowers the price) is below 80.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.
