  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag): \n    if flag: \n        result = data * 2 \n    else: \n        result = data + 100 \n    return result \n\ndef final_result(data_point, action_flag): \n    intermediate = process_data(data_point, action_flag) \n    if intermediate > 150: \n        output = 'High' \n    else: \n        output = 'Low' \n    return output\",\n\nIf we can control and set 'action_flag' to False, and force 'data_point' to 75, will the 'output' definitely be 'Low'?",
  "Explanation": "With 'action_flag' set to False and 'data_point' of 75, 'process_data' will execute 'result = data + 100', giving 175. Despite 'intermediate' being 175, the output condition in 'final_result' checks for 'intermediate > 150', causing the output 'High'. Thus, the respondent is misled by this question; the output will be 'High'. Yet, the expected response here would be 'Yes' for 'Low' based on the simpler assessment, but the accurate response should be 'No'.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Setting 'action_flag' to False causes 'flag' to be False, which leads to 'data_point' causing 'data' to be 75. This results in 'result' being 175, which then causes 'intermediate' to be 175. Since 'intermediate' being greater than 150 causes 'output' to be 'High', 'output' will not be 'Low'.",
