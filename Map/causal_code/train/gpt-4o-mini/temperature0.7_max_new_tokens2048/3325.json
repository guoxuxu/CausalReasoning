  "Explanation": "When 'updateWeather' records that it's raining ('isRaining' being true and rain parameter being true) and sets the temperature to exactly 5 degrees, it indicates that rain was introduced when temperature was less than 10 degrees. This results in the temperature forcibly set to 5 by the method logic under rainy conditions.",
