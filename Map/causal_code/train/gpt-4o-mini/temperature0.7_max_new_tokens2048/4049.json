  "Problem": "class SalesData { constructor(year) { this.year = year; this.salesFigures = {}; this.inflationRate = 0.03; } updateSales(month, value) { this.salesFigures[month] = value; } applyInflation() { Object.keys(this.salesFigures).forEach(month => { this.salesFigures[month] *= (1 + this.inflationRate); }); } calculateTotalSales() { return Object.values(this.salesFigures).reduce((total, current) => total + current, 0); } }\",\n\nIf after an intervention the total sales figure appears significantly higher, can it be concluded that the inflation rate was necessarily adjusted?",
  "Explanation": "While an increased inflation rate can be a cause for higher sales figures, interventions could also include adjustments to the sales figures themselves such as adding more sales or increasing the value of current sales, implying that a higher total doesn't necessarily confirm an adjusted inflation rate.",
