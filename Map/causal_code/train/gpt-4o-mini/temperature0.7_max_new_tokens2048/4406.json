  "Explanation": "The condition inside optimize_conditions that handles temperature over 25 would actually adjust the temperature to 18 automatically and decrease humidity. Even if no manual intervention set the temperature to 26, the automatic response to temperatures above 25 would lead to decreased humidity. Additionally, humidity can be decreased independently through direct methods in the HumidityController.",
