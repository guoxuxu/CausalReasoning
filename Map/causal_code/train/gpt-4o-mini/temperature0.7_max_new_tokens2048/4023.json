  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"This Python code calculates the net earnings of a freelancer who receives various project fees and has some expenses. It applies a tax deduction depending on the net income.\",\n    \"code\": \"def calculate_net_earnings(project_fees, expenses):\n    gross_income = sum(project_fees)\n    net_income = gross_income - expenses\n    if net_income > 100000:\n        tax = 0.3\n    elif net_income > 50000:\n        tax = 0.2\n    else:\n        tax = 0.1\n    return net_income - (net_income * tax)\"\n  },\n\nIf the net earnings decrease, does that imply the expenses have increased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in net earnings can be due to multiple factors including an increase in expenses, but it can also be from a decrease in project fees or a change in the taxation rate if the income brackets are crossed. Hence, one cannot conclusively state that an increase in expenses is the sole reason for a decrease in net earnings.",
