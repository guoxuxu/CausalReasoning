  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(store_hours, advertising_budget):\n    if store_hours > 8:\n        sales = 100\n    else:\n        sales = 50\n    if advertising_budget > 500:\n        sales *= 1.5\n    return sales\",\n\nIf advertising_budget is increased, will sales necessarily increase assuming all other factors remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "The code multiplies the sales by 1.5 if the advertising budget is more than $500. Increasing the budget above this threshold will increase sales, given that all other factors, such as store hours, remain constant.",
