  "Explanation": "By setting x to 0.75 in 'apply_intervention' which returns '2 * x_value + 0.1 * np.random.randn(data_size)', and observing an increase, it implies a direct positive causal influence of 'x' on 'y', since we directly intervened by setting 'x_value' and observed the effect on 'y_intervened' without other dependencies influencing this specific relationship.",
