  "Explanation": "Adding a function to manipulate the initial `balance` based on the final total does not impact the `rate` in the existing calculation model in `calculate_interest`. The `rate` is independently set and not dynamically influenced by the balance or its adjustments. Therefore, operations influencing the balance do not directly change how the rate is determined in the current setup.",
