  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(prices, season, coupon_code):\n    if season == 'Summer':\n        discount_rate = 0.1\n    elif season == 'Winter':\n        discount_rate = 0.2\n    else:\n        discount_rate = 0.05\n\n    if coupon_code:\n        extra_discount = 0.05\n    else:\n        extra_discount = 0.0\n\n    final_prices = [price * (1 - (discount_rate + extra_discount)) for price in prices]\n    return final_prices\",\n\nIf we observe a discount rate sum of 0.15, can we deduce it must be Summer with a coupon applied?",
  "Explanation": "A total discount of 0.15 composed of 0.1 (as specified for Summer) and 0.05 extra (applied when a coupon code is used) indicates this specific combination.",
