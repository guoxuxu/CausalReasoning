  "Explanation": "When the user age is updated to 20, the user becomes an adult, triggering the `update_subscription_status`. However, if the subscription status had already been changed to 'active' by an external intervention, the condition `not self.has_active_subscription()` within `update_subscription_status` evaluates to False. Hence, `offer_discount` will not be called, and the discount remains unchanged.",
