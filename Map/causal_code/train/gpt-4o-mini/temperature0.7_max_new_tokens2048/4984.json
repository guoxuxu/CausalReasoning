  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(prices, is_member, promo_code):\n    discount_rate = 0.05 if is_member else 0.0\n    if promo_code == 'SAVE20':\n        discount_rate += 0.2\n    return [price * (1 - discount_rate) for price in prices]\",\n\nObserving a discount_rate of 0.25, can we conclude the customer used the promo code 'SAVE20'?",
  "Explanation": "The only way to achieve a total discount rate of 0.25 in the provided code is by both being a member (which gives a 0.05 discount) and using the promo code 'SAVE20' (which adds an additional 0.2 discount), as there are no other conditions or interactions affecting 'discount_rate' beyond membership status and promo code.",
