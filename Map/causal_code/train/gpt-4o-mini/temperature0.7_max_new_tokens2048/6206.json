  "Explanation": "By setting `c` to 30 through intervention and observing `d` as 35, we can deduce that the True branch of the conditional (`if b > 10`) was executed, implying `b > 10`. This is because the False branch (c - a) would not result in 35 when `c` is fixed to 30, as it would produce `c - 5 = 25`.",
