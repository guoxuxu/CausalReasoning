  "Explanation": "Implementing a mandatory exercise policy would ensure 'has_exercise' is true for everyone. In the function, exercising contributes positively by avoiding a 30-point deduction from the base score. Thus, introducing such a policy would lead to an increase in the health scores overall.",
