  "Explanation": "Setting the air quality index to a high value artificially (e.g., overriding the data variable without using the updateFactoryStatus function) does not necessarily reflect the actual operational status of the factory. The air quality can be manipulated independently of the factory's status, hence it's not a reliable method to infer the operational status of the factory.",
