  "Explanation": "The output of noisy_data is based on random numerical additions; therefore, it is impossible to deduce precisely which seed was used just by observing noisy_data. Different seeds could produce similar random additions, leading to homogeneously indistinguishable outcomes. Here, understanding the effect backward to its random cause remains non-deterministic despite intervention.",
