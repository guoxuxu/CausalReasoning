  "Explanation": "If all conditions are known (e.g., the person is sick and engages in high outdoor activity) and the temperature increase is still less than expected (less than base temp + 7), the use of antipyretic medication is a likely cause since its effect is to reduce the temperature increase as specified in the code.",
