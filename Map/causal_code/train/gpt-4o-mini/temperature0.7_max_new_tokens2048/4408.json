  "Explanation": "While a larger 'final_value' suggests that 'data_sum' was greater than 100, this doesn't necessarily mean each individual number in 'data' was large. It only means the cumulative effect of all numbers multiplied by 5 was significant enough to meet the 'is_large' condition.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
