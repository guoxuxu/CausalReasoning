  "Explanation": "A lower infection rate could be due to a variety of factors including fewer infected individuals or a larger population, not solely the effectiveness of preventative measures. The infection rate is affected by both the ratio of infected to population and optionally the preventative measures' effectiveness, but it is not solely indicative of the latter.",
