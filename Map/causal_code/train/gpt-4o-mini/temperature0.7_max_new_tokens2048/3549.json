  "Explanation": "Under the new system change (intervention) that gives an extra 0.05 discount to new customers regardless of age, the discount amount alone (0.25) doesn't uniquely identify the age group (>30 or ≤30) since both age groups could potentially reach the 0.25 discount through varying combinations of age group and new customer status.",
