  "Problem": "See above Python class `Store` and its usage.\",\n\nCan starting a promotional discount directly increase sales data without first attracting more customers?",
  "Explanation": "While `promo_sales` announces a discount potentially attracting more customers, it does not directly increase sales data. Sales data is only incremented by actual sales in `sell_item`, which is dependent on customer purchases.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
