  "Explanation": "Increasing the multiplication factor directly increases the values of 'income', potentially moving more data points above the 50000 threshold, thereby increasing 'high_income_count' in 'analyze_data'. The change in handling of 'income' inside 'clean_data' constitutes an intervention that directly affects the count of high incomes.",
