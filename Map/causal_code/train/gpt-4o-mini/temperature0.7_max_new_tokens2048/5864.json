  "Explanation": "The rain prediction of 'High chance of rain' indicates that clouds have formed and the humidity is above 80, but it does not provide definitive information about the exact temperature. While cloud formation suggests a temperature less than 20, the exact value within that range can't be inferred from the rain prediction alone.",
