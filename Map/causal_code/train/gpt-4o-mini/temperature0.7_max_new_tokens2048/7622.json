  "Explanation": "Decrease in 'process_data' output suggests the average value of data has decreased; however, this could be due to many factors not limited to more negative values; it may also be caused by the presence of smaller positive values or other changes in data composition.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
