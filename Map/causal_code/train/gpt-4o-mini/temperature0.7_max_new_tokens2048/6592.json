  "Explanation": "Changing 'x_factor' from False to True changes the operation on 'data' from cubing to squaring. For the same 'data', squaring usually results in a smaller number than cubing if 'data' > 1, possibly reducing 'processed' below the threshold of 100, which can change 'result' from True to False, or maintain it as False, depending on the original 'data' value.",
