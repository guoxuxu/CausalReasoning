  "Explanation": "The significant increase in sales might likely be attributed to the increase in the advertising budget as per the defined relationship in the code. Although summer would contribute more to sales, the effect of season is confounded by the increase in the advertising budget, thus it cannot be definitively concluded that it must be summer.",
