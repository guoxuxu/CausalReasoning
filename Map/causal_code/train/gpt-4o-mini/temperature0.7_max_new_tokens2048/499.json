  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate \n    total_price = price + tax_amount - discount \n    demand = max(0, 100 - total_price) \n    return total_price, demand\n\nprice = 100 \ntax_rate = 0.05 \ndiscount = 10 \n\nrevenue, demand = compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount) \n\n# Implement a promotional campaign \ndef promotion_effect(demand):\n    new_demand = demand + 20 \n    return new_demand\n\n# Calculate new demand after promotion \nnew_demand = promotion_effect(demand)\",\n\nIf we implement a promotional campaign to add 20 more units to demand, does this directly affect the total_price?",
  "Explanation": "The promotional campaign function adds a fixed increase to demand and does not alter the total_price directly. The total_price remains calculated from price, tax_rate, and discount as before and isn't affected by the change in demand due to promotion.",
