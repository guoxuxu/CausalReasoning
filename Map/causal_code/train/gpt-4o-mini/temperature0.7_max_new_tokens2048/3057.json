  "Explanation": "If the 'make_investment' method returns a failure (setting 'investment_success' to False), it means that the condition checking if funds are sufficient (funds >= investment_amount) was not met. This directly indicates that the funds were less than the investment amount prior to attempting the investment. This is a valid cause to effect inference with the method acting as an intervening mechanism.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial investment increases the funds available in the portfolio. Adding funds further increases the total funds. The total funds determine the risk profile, where funds above 100,000 result in a high risk profile and funds at or below 100,000 result in a low risk profile. Making an investment decreases the available funds, and if the available funds are less than the investment amount, the investment fails.",
