  "Explanation": "Since Charlie initially starts at 105 and ends at 100, and given that the scores that exceed 100 are reduced by the set penalty, Charlie's unchanging final score at 100 implies that the bonus added was exactly counterbalanced by the penalty. No other changes affecting the final score took place according to the code.",
