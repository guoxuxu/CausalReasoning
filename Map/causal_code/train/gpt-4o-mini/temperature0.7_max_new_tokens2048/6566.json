  "Explanation": "The function 'remove_duplicates' removes duplicates from data, impacting the 'data' input to 'clean_data'. While it indirectly affects the data processed by later functions, it doesn't directly influence the logic in 'infer_results' where 'conclusion' is based on the mean of the statistics.",
