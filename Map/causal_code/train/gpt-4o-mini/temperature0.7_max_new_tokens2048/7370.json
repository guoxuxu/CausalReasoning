  "Explanation": "Good growth can result from either 'rainy' weather or when water is 'no water needed' due to rainy conditions, but it can also occur if water conditions are appropriately managed (e.g., no water needed due to prior conditions not specified or other unseen interventions). Thus, good growth alone does not definitively signal recent rain.",
