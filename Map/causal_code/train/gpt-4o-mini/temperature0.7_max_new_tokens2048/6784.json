Is the temperature then necessarily below 5 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "Artificially setting the weather status does not affect the actual values of temperature and humidity due to the lack of feedback from status to these conditions in the code. The temperature could still be any value, as we've bypassed the logic that normally sets the weather status based on temperature and humidity.",
