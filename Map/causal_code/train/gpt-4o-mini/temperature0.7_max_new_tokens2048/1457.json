  "Explanation": "The proposed intervention does not affect the existing conditional branch where ages between 25 and 50 result in a 'low' risk category. Thus, a 30-year-old, who does not meet the new under-25 condition, would still be categorized as 'low' risk, as per the original branching logic.",
