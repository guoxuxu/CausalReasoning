  "Explanation": "Doubling x will double y (since y = 2x). This ensures a significant change in z (z = y + 3). Depending on whether z crosses the threshold of 10, result will either increase or follow a new computation (either z - 5 or z + 5 will still lead to an increase if the initial z was below 10, or alter the difference if z was initially greater than 10). The magnitude and direct effect of x on z ensures that the resultant value changes.",
