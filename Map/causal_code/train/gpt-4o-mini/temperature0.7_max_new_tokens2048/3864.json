  "Explanation": "Reducing the environmental pollution levels affects the health status by possibly changing it to 'Healthy' directly if the new pollution level is under 50 and the person's activity level doesn't meet the previous requirement. This represents a causal effect from an environmental intervention (cause) directly to the person's health status (effect).",
