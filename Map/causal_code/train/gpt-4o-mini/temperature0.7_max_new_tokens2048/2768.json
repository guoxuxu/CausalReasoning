  "Explanation": "Intervening by setting 'isCpuOverloaded' to false and checking 'isMemoryFull' to be true means that the system check condition '(isCpuOverloaded || isMemoryFull)' still returns true if the memory is full. Thus, a notification will still be sent when memory is full, independent of the CPU status after the intervention.",
