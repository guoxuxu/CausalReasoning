  "Problem": "...\",\n\nCan observing an increase in predator population confirm an increase in herbivore population without other interventions?",
  "Explanation": "In the `feed_predators` method, predators only increase substantially (+5) if the herbivore population is sufficient (>=10). Given no other intervention blocking or mimicking this effect, observing increased predators typically implies increased herbivores.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",
  "causal_map": "increase in predator population → increase in predation pressure on herbivores; increase in predation pressure on herbivores → decrease in herbivore population; increase in herbivore population → increase in food availability for predators",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
