  "Problem": "def process_data(data): \n    if 'discount' in data:\n        price = data['price'] * (1 - data['discount'])\n    else:\n        price = data['price']\n    if price > 20:\n        shipping = 5\n    else:\n        shipping = 2\n    total_cost = price + shipping\n    return total_cost\",\n\nIf the function process_data returns a total_cost of 22, can we deduce that the original price was lower than 20?",
  "Explanation": "A total cost of 22 could occur in a scenario where the price exactly equals 20 and no discount is applied, where shipping would then be set at 2, summing to a total of 22. Another scenario might be a price slightly above 20 with a discount that reduces the price but keeps it above 20 which results in a shipping cost of 5, with total cost summing to around 22. Thus, from the effect of the total cost, the exact cause in terms of original price can’t be unambiguously inferred without more information.",
