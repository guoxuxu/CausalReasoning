  "Explanation": "The policy intervention increases the base salary, which by design should increase total salary. If the total salary decreases instead, it suggests other factors are at play; however, since the bonus is calculated based on performance rating and additional bonus from years of experience, a decrease in either will not affect the amount added to the base salary but rather the bonus part. Thus, the mere observation of a decrease in total salary does not conclusively mean a decrease in performance rating or years of experience.",
