  "Explanation": "Since the alert is set to True if either the temperature exceeds 30 or the humidity exceeds 70, a False alert status indicates that neither condition was met. Thus, it's valid to conclude that both the temperature was below 30 and the humidity was below 70, assuming the class and its methods operate correctly and there were no other interventions.",
