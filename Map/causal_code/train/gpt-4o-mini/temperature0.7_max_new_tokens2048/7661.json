  "Problem": "def compute_health_index(age, smoking_status, exercise_freq, diet_quality):\n    base_health = 100\n    age_penalty = age * 0.5\n    smoke_penalty = 20 if smoking_status else 0\n    exercise_bonus = 10 * exercise_freq\n    diet_bonus = 5 * diet_quality\n    health_index = base_health - age_penalty + exercise_bonus + diet_bonus - smoke_penalty\n    return health_index\",\n\nIf age increases, will the health index decrease, assuming other factors remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "The function computes the health index by subtracting an 'age_penalty' that increases with age. Thus, with all other parameters held constant, an increase in age leads to a higher age penalty, which in turn decreases the health index.",
