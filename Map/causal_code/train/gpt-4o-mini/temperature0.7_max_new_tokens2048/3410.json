  "Explanation": "The 'dayPasses()' method reduces the water level by 4 units each time it is called. If 'water()' or 'soakSun()' are not called to increase the water level, repeated calls to 'dayPasses()' will eventually reduce the water level to below 10, resulting in the plant's status becoming 'Unhealthy'. This is a case of testing from cause (day passing without water or sun) to effect (health status of the plant).",
