  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, quantity, discount_rate=0.1, tax_rate=0.2):\n    discount = price * quantity * discount_rate\n    tax = (price * quantity - discount) * tax_rate\n    total_sales = (price * quantity - discount) + tax\n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf the quantity of items sold increases, will the total sales necessarily increase, assuming other factors remain constant?",
  "Explanation": "In the given function, if the quantity increases while the price, discount rate, and tax rate are held constant, the total sales will increase. This is because both the base sales (price * quantity) and tax calculation (which is a function of the base sales minus the discount) increase with higher quantity. Since discount is directly proportional to the quantity as well, the overall total sales increase.",
