  "Explanation": "While the activity 'Stay indoor' does suggest it is raining as per decide_activity(), this could also mean that the temperature is not above 80 degrees, hence lack of sufficient evidence to conclude it definitely rained. It's also possible that other unmodeled conditions like a forecast warning influenced this suggestion.",
