  "Explanation": "An increase in the ratio (observed effect) does not necessarily imply just an increase in pressure (cause) since the numerator (pressure) or a simultaneous decrease in temperature can achieve the same effect. Without knowing which component changed, it's incorrect to conclude that only pressure was increased.",
