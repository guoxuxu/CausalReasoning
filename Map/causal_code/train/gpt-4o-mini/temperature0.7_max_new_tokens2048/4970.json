  "Explanation": "'apply_discount' multiplies the price by a factor determined by subtracting 'discount_rate' from 1. Since 'discount_rate' can either be 0.0, 0.2, or 0.3, a price change alone doesn't indicate that the original price was necessarily above 20 since 'discount_rate' can be non-zero for prices below 20 as well.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If a product is discounted, then it has a discount rate. The price influences whether the product is discounted. A new price below 20 results in the product being marked as discounted and having a higher discount rate.
