  "Explanation": "In the forecast_temperature method, forecasted temperature is adjusted by -0.1 times the humidity. If we intervene by manually adjusting the humidity using adjust_humidity method or directly, it will affect the forecast regardless of days_ahead, as shown by -0.1 * self.humidity affecting the forecast calculation.",
