  "Problem": "def calculate_health(running, diet_quality, hours_of_sleep):\n    fitness = running * 0.3 + diet_quality * 0.5\n    health_score = fitness * 2 + hours_of_sleep * 0.8\n    return health_score\n\nhealth = calculate_health(running=3, diet_quality=8, hours_of_sleep=7)\",\n\nGiven a decrease in `health_score`, if we hold `diet_quality` constant, does this imply that either `running` or `hours_of_sleep` has decreased?",
  "Explanation": "Since `diet_quality` is held constant, the only other factors that can cause a decrease in `health_score` are decreases in `running` or `hours_of_sleep`. Since both these factors directly contribute to the determination of `health_score`, a reduction in either while keeping `diet_quality` constant must be the cause of the decrease in `health_score`.",
