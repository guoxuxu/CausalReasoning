  "Explanation": "The function 'process_data' calculates the sum of 'data_list'. Any change in the values within 'data_list' directly changes the sum, and consequently, alters the 'result', which is the output. This is an example of 'from cause to effect without intervention' as we are examining how changes in the input data list affect the output without modifying any other part of the program flow.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
