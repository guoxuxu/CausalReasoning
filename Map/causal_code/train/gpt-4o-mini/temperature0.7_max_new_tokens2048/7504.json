  "Explanation": "Reducing the final_amount through an intervention could be due to either an increase in the discount_rate or a decrease in total_sales or tax_rate. Without knowing what exactly was manipulated in the intervention, one cannot conclusively state that the reduction in final_amount was due to an increase in discount_rate.",
