  "Problem": "def compute_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, season):\n    if season == 'winter':\n        discount_rate += 0.05\n    elif season == 'summer':\n        discount_rate -= 0.03\n    final_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate)\n    tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate\n    total_price = final_price + tax_amount\n    return total_price\",\n\nIf the total_price observed is higher than usual, can it be inferred that the base_price was higher?",
  "Explanation": "While a higher base_price can lead to a higher total_price, other factors such as a lower discount_rate or higher tax_rate could also result in a higher total_price. Therefore, one cannot conclusively infer the increase in base_price just from an increase in total_price without considering these factors.",
