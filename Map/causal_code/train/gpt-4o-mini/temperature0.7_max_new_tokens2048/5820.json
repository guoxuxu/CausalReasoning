  "Explanation": "Since 'At Risk' status is attributed to individuals who are 30 years or older with a diet quality of 7 or less, knowing their health status as 'At Risk' implies their age and diet quality falls into this category, moving backwards from effect (health status) to cause (age and diet quality).",
