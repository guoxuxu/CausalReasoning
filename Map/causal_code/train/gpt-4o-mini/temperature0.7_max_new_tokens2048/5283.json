  "Explanation": "In the code, the relationship provided states that rain stops (`isRaining = false`) when the temperature is at or rises above 20 degrees C. The function `increaseTemperature` explicitly sets `isRaining` to false when temperature goes 20 or above without requiring any external interference.",
