  "Explanation": "If the output states a 'High' possibility of rain, it means that within the function's logic, the humidity must be greater than 70, as this is the condition being checked. Even though the question implies an intervention scenario, knowing this particular effect (high possibility of rain) suffices to confirm that the cause (humidity > 70) is present.",
