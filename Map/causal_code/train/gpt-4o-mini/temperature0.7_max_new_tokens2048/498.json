  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate \n    total_price = price + tax_amount - discount \n    demand = max(0, 100 - total_price) \n    return total_price, demand\n\nprice = 100 \ntax_rate = 0.05 \ndiscount = 10 \n\nrevenue, demand = compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount) \n\n# Implement a promotional campaign \ndef promotion_effect(demand):\n    new_demand = demand + 20 \n    return new_demand\n\n# Calculate new demand after promotion \nnew_demand = promotion_effect(demand)\",\n\nIf the demand increased significantly, can this suggest that the original tax rate was reduced, without any intervention?",
  "Explanation": "In the original setup without interventions like the promotion, an increase in demand cannot be directly inferred from a change in tax rate alone as demand's calculation also depends heavily on price and discount factors. Unless these are controlled, a mere increase in demand isn't sufficient to infer reduced tax rates.",
