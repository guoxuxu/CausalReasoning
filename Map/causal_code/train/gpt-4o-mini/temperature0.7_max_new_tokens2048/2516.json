  "Explanation": "While a higher 'user_score' would likely lead to a 'high' status by crossing the threshold of 75 points after adjustments, starting with a lower 'user_score' but close enough to 75 (like 65) could also yield a 'high' status after being incremented by 10. Thus, a 'high' status does not guarantee that the 'user_score' started high, only that it was within a certain range sufficient to achieve a 'high' post-adjustment score.",
