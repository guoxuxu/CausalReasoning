  "Problem": "class Store {\n  int customers;\n  double price;\n  boolean promotion;\n\n  double calcSales() {\n    if (promotion) {\n      price *= 0.8;\n    }\n    return customers * price;\n  }\n\n  void setPromotion(boolean status) {\n    promotion = status;\n  }\n\n  void adjustPrice(double newPrice) {\n    if (newPrice > price) {\n      price = newPrice;\n    }\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf a promotion is set, will the sales definitely increase?",
  "Explanation": "When a promotion is set, the price per unit is decreased by 20%, lowering the immediate revenue per unit sold unless the decrease in price is sufficiently offset by an increase in customers. Hence, without knowing whether the number of customers increases enough to offset the discount, one cannot definitively claim that sales will increase.",
