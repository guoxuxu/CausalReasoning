  "Explanation": "In the original code, the value of 'multiplier' is set based on the presence of 'scale' in the input dictionary. This 'multiplier' is used to calculate 'result'. Hence, changes in 'multiplier' directly affect 'result'.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
