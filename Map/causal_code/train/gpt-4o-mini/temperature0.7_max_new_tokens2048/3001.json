  "Explanation": "Since the intervention standardized the discounts to 15, knowing that the final_price is 85 provides no information on whether the original coupon code was 'SAVE10' or 'SAVE20'. The causal pathway from the original coupon code to the total price has been obscured by the intervention.",
