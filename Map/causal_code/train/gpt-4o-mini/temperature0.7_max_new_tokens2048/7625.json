  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'raw' value will increase the 'adjusted' value only if the 'factor' remains constant. However, whether 'status' shows 'high' also depends on the 'adjusted' value being greater than 100. Thus, without knowing the 'factor', you can't be certain that 'status' will be 'high'.",
