  "Problem": "def compute_discount_and_total(price, quantity, membership_status):\n    discount_rate = 0.05 if membership_status == 'Premium' else 0\n    discount = price * quantity * discount_rate\n    tax_rate = 0.07\n    subtotal = price * quantity - discount\n    total = subtotal + (subtotal * tax_rate)\n    return {'discount': discount, 'total': total}\n\nresult = compute_discount_and_total(200, 3, 'Premium')\",\n\nIf observing a higher total amount, can we conclude the price per item was higher?",
  "Explanation": "A higher total amount can be caused by several factors other than just a higher price per item, such as an increased quantity or a 'Standard' membership status (resulting in no discount). Without controlling for those factors, we cannot conclude that the price per item was solely responsible for the higher total.",
