  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(store_area, competitors_nearby):\n    if competitors_nearby > 3:\n        base_sales = 200\n    else:\n        base_sales = 300\n    enhanced_store_area = store_area ** 0.5\n    predicted_sales = base_sales + (50 * enhanced_store_area)\n    return predicted_sales\",\n\nGiven a decrease in predicted sales, can we infer that the number of competitors has increased without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "While an increase in competitors generally decreases base_sales, reducing predicted sales, the predicted sales are also dependent on the 'store_area'. A decrease in predicted sales could also be due to a smaller store area or other factors not modeled in the function. Therefore, a decrease in sales alone does not robustly indicate an increase in the number of competitors.",
