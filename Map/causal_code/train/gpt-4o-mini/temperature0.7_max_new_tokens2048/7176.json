  "Problem": "def calculate_net_salary(gross_salary, tax_rate, bonus_percentage):\n    taxes = gross_salary * tax_rate\n    bonus = gross_salary * bonus_percentage\n    net_salary = gross_salary - taxes + bonus\n    return net_salary\",\n\nIf we manipulate the net salary by changing taxation rules, can we infer changes in the gross salary?",
  "Explanation": "Manipulating net salary by altering tax rules only provides information about the dependence of net salary on tax rates under the conditions of that intervention. It does not provide direct information about gross salary since multiple configurations of gross salary, tax rate, and bonus percentage can lead to the same net salary.",
