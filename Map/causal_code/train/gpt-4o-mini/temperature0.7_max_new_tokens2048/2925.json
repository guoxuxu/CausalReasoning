  "Explanation": "When the action is fixed to 'multiply', a higher final score implies that the scaling factor, delta, was higher. Since multiplication scales the initial scores by the delta value, observing a higher resulting score would suggest a higher delta was applied, assuming no other interventions in the scores.",
