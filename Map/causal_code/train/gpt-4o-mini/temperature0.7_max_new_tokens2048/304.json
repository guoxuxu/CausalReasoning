  "Explanation": "The function compute_interest works in a forward-processing manner, calculating the interest based on the existing account balance, interest rate, and time without back-propagation mechanisms. If final_interest is set, it does not inherently modify any initial inputs such as initial_balance; instead, adjustments needed would have to be calculated manually or with a different algorithm configured for this purpose.",
