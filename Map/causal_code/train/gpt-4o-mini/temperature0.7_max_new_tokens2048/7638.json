  "Explanation": "The forecast being 'sunny' does suggest that the temperature is possibly over 20 degrees Celsius; however, it's not a definitive deduction because 'sunny' weather could also happen at other conditions if interventions on humidity or other attributes are made. Thus, there's no certainty about the cause (temperature) solely based on the effect (forecast) without knowing all conditions.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature directly influences the forecasted weather condition, with higher temperatures leading to a higher likelihood of sunny weather. Humidity also affects the forecast, where higher humidity at elevated temperatures results in rain instead of sun. Additionally, wind speed can lead to stormy weather if it exceeds a certain threshold, and changes in humidity can alter the forecasted weather condition.",
