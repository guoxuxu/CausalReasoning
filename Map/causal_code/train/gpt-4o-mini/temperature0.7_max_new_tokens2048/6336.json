  "Explanation": "The coffee machine will only power on ('Coffee machine is ready') if both water and coffee beans are present in sufficient quantities. Hence, inability to start indicates that either one or both of these elements are not adequately filled, demonstrating causality from the effect (machine failing to start) to the potential causes (lack of water, coffee beans, or both).",
