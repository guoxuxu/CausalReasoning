  "Explanation": "Increasing the thermostat_setting does not necessarily mean that the adjusted_temperature will increase. The effect of the adjustment depends on the relation between the current_temperature and the new thermostat_setting. If the current_temperature was already near or above the original setting, increasing the setting might not change the adjusted temperature or might even decrease it if the new setting overshoots.",
