  "Explanation": "Manually overriding the sensor affects the system's ability to check levels but does not change the physical requirements (50 units of water and 10 units of coffee beans) necessary to actually produce coffee. Thus, the machine will still require these amounts to function properly even if the sensor is bypassed, exhibiting a persistent causal link despite the intervention.",
