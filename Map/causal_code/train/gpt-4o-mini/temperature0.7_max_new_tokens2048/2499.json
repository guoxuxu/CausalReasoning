  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in age may influence the risk factor, but it does not directly cause a change in the risk factor. Weight affects BMI, which in turn can influence the heart rate and the risk factor. A heart rate above 100 results in a 'High' risk factor, while a BMI above 25 increases the heart rate by 5 and results in a 'Medium' risk factor. Additionally, if weight exceeds 200, it increases the heart rate by 10 and can also influence the risk factor.",
