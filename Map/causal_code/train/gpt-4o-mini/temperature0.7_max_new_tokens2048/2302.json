  "Explanation": "Resetting pollution to initial levels doesn’t necessarily imply that production stopped; it might be due to intervening environmental management actions such as pollution cleanup or introduction of pollution control technologies. Thus, production could still be ongoing even if pollution levels are managed or reduced.",
