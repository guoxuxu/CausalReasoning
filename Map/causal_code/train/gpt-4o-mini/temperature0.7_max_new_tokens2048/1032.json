  "Explanation": "In the code, the class Weather changes the attribute is_rainy to True when the temperature is below 20 degrees. Consequently, the function plan_outdoor_event will return 'Plan indoor events' when is_rainy is True, implying more indoor events will be planned in colder temperatures.",
