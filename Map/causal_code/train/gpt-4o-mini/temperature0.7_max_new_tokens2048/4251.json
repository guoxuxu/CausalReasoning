  "Problem": "class WeatherSimulator {\n  private int temperature;\n  private boolean isRaining;\n\n  public WeatherSimulator(int temperature, boolean isRaining) {\n    this.temperature = temperature;\n    this.isRaining = isRaining;\n  }\n\n  public void adjustTemperature(int change) {\n    this.temperature += change;\n  }\n\n  public void triggerRain(boolean startRain) {\n    this.isRaining = startRain;\n  }\n\n  public boolean isSuitableForHiking() {\n    return this.temperature > 20 && !this.isRaining;\n  }\n}\n\",\n\nIf it is suitable for hiking, can we infer that it is definitely not raining?",
  "Explanation": "The condition for suitability for hiking is defined by the temperature being more than 20 degrees and no rain. Therefore, if it is suitable for hiking, we can infer with certainty that it is not raining.",
