  "Explanation": "Making it sunny through the 'increaseTemperature' does not specifically involve stopping the rain if it was already raining. 'startRain' can make it not sunny irrespective of temperature, but sunny weather achieved by temperature doesn't imply the rain must have been actively stopped; it could just have not been raining to begin with.",
