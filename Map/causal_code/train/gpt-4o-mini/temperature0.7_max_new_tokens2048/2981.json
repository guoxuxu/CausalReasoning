  "Explanation": "Even if an intervention adjusts the price, a discounted_price of 80 does not solely indicate that is_member was True. The final price could also be adjusted by altering the base price. Without knowing the specific change to the price due to the intervention, is_member's value cannot be definitely known from the resulting price alone.",
