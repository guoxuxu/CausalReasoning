  "Problem": "Snippet provided above\",\n\nCould lowering inventory counts after using 'check_inventory' imply that 'sell_item' was executed?",
  "Explanation": "A lowered inventory count subsequent to using 'check_inventory' typically infers that a selling transaction occurred, reducing the quantity of the checked item, assuming no other interventions like spoilage or theft.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
