  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, increment, should_update): \n    if should_update: \n        for i in range(len(prices)): \n            prices[i] += increment \n    return prices\",\n\nWould setting `increment` to zero ensure the prices remain unchanged regardless of the `should_update` value?",
  "Explanation": "By setting `increment` to zero, each price in `prices` will be increased by zero, effectively leaving all prices unchanged. This intervention (`increment`=0) prevents any price change irrespective of the `should_update` value.",
