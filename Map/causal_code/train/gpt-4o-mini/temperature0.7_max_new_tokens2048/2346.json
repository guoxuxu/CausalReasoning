  "Explanation": "The observation of the category turning to 'Adult' post-intervention does not necessarily indicate that the original mean was below 30. The intervention could have changed the statistical properties of the age data significantly regardless of its original state, leading to the new categorization as 'Adult'. Thus, the original mean age cannot be conclusively determined just from the effect of the intervention.",
