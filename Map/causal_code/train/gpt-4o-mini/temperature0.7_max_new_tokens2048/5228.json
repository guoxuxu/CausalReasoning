  "Explanation": "The decrease_humidity method directly reduces the humidity without impacting the temperature. However, a significant reduction in humidity could cause the temperature to decrease if humidity falls below 30%, illustrating an effect (lower humidity) not conclusively pointing to a specific cause (temperature decrease) without further information.",
