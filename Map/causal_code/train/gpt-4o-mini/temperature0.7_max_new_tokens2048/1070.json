  "Explanation": "By fixing 'b' and 'x' and only increasing 'a', the only variable affecting 'c' is 'a'. Since 'c' is 'a+b' and both 'b' and 'x' are constant, an increase in 'a' results directly in an increase in 'c', and in turn, since 'x > 0', increases 'd' which is 'c*x'. Thus, with no other changes, increasing 'a' will increase 'd'.",
