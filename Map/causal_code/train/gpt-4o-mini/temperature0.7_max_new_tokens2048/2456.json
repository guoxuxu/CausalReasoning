  "Explanation": "Seeing more instances of 'Stay indoors' can imply that the Mood instance often evaluates to unhappy, which according to the code happens when it is raining or the temperature is 20 or less. Since no temperature information was specified, increased instance of rain becomes a reasonable inference.",
