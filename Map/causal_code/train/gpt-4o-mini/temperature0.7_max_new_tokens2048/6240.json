  "Explanation": "Within the logic of this code, the only pathway to set `has_automatic_transmission` to True requires the car to be fuel efficient (`if self.is_fuel_efficient`). Since the method `apply_automatic_transmission` checks for fuel efficiency first, a car having automatic transmission implies it was already fuel efficient.",
