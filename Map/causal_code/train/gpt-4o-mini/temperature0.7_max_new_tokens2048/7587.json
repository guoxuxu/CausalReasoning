  "Problem": "Python code snippet for a basic manufacturing system handling production, sales, and stock management.\",\n\nIf the production rate increases due to a managerial intervention, will the stock levels be higher at the end of the day compared to a day with lower production rate?",
  "Explanation": "From cause to effect with intervention: Increasing the production rate (assuming sales stay constant) directly increases the amount of product available, thus increasing stock by day's end. This assumes sales figures do not change to offset the increased production.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
