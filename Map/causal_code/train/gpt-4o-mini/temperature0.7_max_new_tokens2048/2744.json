  "Explanation": "The outcome of the status report purely depends on the temperature sensor and the logic within `adjust_heating`. Manually changing the status of the heating does not affect the internal decision-making process in `adjust_heating`, which relies on the value of `current_temperature` propositioned by `temperature_sensor`.",
