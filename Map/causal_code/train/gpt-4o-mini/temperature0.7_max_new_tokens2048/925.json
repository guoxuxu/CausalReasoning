  "Explanation": "If 'use_filter' is set to False, all data points, irrespective of their value relative to 'filter_value', are included in 'filtered_data'. This can lower the average (sum) if lower-valued points that would have been excluded by the filter are included, thereby affecting 'result'. Thus, observing a lower 'result' could suggest that maybe 'use_filter' should have been True to exclude these values.",
