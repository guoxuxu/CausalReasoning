  "Problem": "class WeatherController { constructor() { this.temperature = 20; this.humidity = 50; } heatUp() { this.temperature += 5; this.updateHumidity(); } cooldown() { this.temperature -= 5; this.updateHumidity(); } updateHumidity() { this.humidity = this.temperature > 25 ? 60 : 40; } } const controller = new WeatherController(); controller.heatUp(); console.log(controller.temperature, controller.humidity);\",\n\nIf an external method setTemperature(newTemperature) is introduced to set specific temperatures, and it's used to set the temperature above 25, will that cause the humidity to change?",
  "Explanation": "Introducing and using setTemperature(newTemperature) directly manipulates temperature. If it sets temperature above 25, it would influence the outcome of the updateHumidity() method (which checks if temperature > 25 to determine humidity level), thereby affecting humidity. This represents an intervention from cause (setting temperature) to effect (change in humidity).",
