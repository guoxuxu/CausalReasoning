  "Explanation": "Given that the temperature condition remains 'Cool' (below 30 degrees), any observed change from 'Dry' to 'Humid' directly relates to an increase in humidity. This increase in humidity must have been made through an intervention (manual update) since the temperature has stayed consistent and only a change in humidity condition could result in the switch from 'Dry' to 'Humid'.",
