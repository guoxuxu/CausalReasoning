  "Explanation": "Although a high sales figure can correlate with higher temperatures, simply intervening with a temperature above 75 won't conclusively cause high sales over 220. High sales can occur from either a unique discount factor or other unaccounted factors, implying multiple causal paths could achieve similar sales outcomes without specifically attributing it to the temperature alone.",
