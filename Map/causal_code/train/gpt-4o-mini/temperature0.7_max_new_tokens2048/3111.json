  "Explanation": "A lower base_index does indeed correspond to ages over 50 as per the logic in the code, but a base_index of 70 could technically also occur in cases where the age is not over 50 but a higher activity level compensates for the deduction due to higher weight, maintaining the index at the said value. Thus, the correlation alone cannot definitively imply causation.",
