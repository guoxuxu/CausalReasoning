  "Explanation": "By activating the sensor using 'activate()', the sensor begins to detect and count movements. If sufficient movements (more than five) are detected, the alarm is triggered. The activation directly allows the sensor to record movements and eventually trigger the alarm if the threshold is exceeded.",
