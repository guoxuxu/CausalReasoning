  "Explanation": "Increasing the height while keeping the weight constant results in a lower BMI because the denominator (height squared) in the BMI calculation increases. A lower BMI could shift the risk level from 'high' or 'medium' to a lower category, based on the defined thresholds in `assess_risk`.",
