  "Explanation": "Since adjusted_temp is calculated as adjusted_temp = temperature * 1.8 + 32, the only way for 'adjusted_temp' to decrease is if 'temperature' itself decreases. This one-way causal effect means that observing a decrease in 'adjusted_temp' allows us to conclude that 'temperature' was decreased.",
