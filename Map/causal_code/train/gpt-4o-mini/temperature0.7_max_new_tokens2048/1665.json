  "Explanation": "After invoking invest_more(), additional_amount is added to the investment. Then, the adjust_investment() is called with the current market trend, which can either increase, decrease, or maintain the investment size depending on whether the market is 'bull', 'bear', or 'neutral'. Hence, even after the intervention, the market trend affects the total investment size.",
