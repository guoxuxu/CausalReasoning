  "Explanation": "In the method calculate_sales, 'sales' is computed based on the condition whether 'price' is less than 'competitor_price'. Thus, reducing 'competitor_price' could change the relationship status (i.e., from 'price' not being less than 'competitor_price' to being less), thereby impacting 'sales' directly.",
