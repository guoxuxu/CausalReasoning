  "Explanation": "In the scenario where warning_level changes to 'high' following an intervention, such as artificially setting max_temp, it indicates that avg_humidity was already meeting its conditional threshold (> 50). This response ties the effect (warning_level) back to the prerequisite conditions for both temperature and humidity, under the influence of an intervention.",
