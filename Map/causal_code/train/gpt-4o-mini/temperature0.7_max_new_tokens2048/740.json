  "Explanation": "The final_price is calculated based on the base_price and tax rate. An increase or decrease in the base_price changes the initial calculation in calculate_final_price(). Although there's a subsequent conditional discount in apply_discount(), the initial effect of the base_price on the final_price remains.",
