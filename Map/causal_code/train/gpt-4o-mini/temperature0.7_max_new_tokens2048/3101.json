  "Explanation": "Changing the decision on carrying an umbrella doesn't affect the weather condition itself, as these two variables ('umbrella' and 'weather') are independent in their causality with respect to intervention on umbrella decision. 'Weather' influences both 'umbrella' and 'traffic', but changing 'umbrella' doesn't provide new information about 'weather'.",
