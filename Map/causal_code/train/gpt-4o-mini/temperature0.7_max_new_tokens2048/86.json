  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'new_inventory' can be due to an increase in 'units_sold', a decrease in 'units_added', or even a decrease in the initial 'current_inventory'. Without additional information or holding other variables constant, we cannot determine the specific cause from the effect observed.",
