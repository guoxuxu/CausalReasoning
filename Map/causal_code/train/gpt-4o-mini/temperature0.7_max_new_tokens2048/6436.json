  "Explanation": "Since the average is greater than 25, and the average is the sum divided by the count of numbers, this implies at least one number must be significantly contributing to increasing the sum, hence must be greater than 25, assuming the numbers are of the typical variety where the sum is not dominated by smaller numbers.",
