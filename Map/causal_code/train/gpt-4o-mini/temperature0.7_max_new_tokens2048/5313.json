  "Explanation": "Given that the 'person_health' method in the Health class returns 'healthy' for persons with an activity level over 5 in sunny weather, setting the activity to 7 secures a sunny environment for health to be 'healthy', assuming no drastic weather changes influenced by other factors.",
