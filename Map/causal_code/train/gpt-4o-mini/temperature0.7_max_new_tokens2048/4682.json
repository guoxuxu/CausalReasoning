  "Explanation": "Although changing activity level from low to high (factor decreasing from 1.2 to 0.8) reduces the risk factor and can shift the health condition status, it isn’t the only factor that could cause such a change. Interventions like quitting smoking or other undocumented health improvements could also be responsible for the category change.",
