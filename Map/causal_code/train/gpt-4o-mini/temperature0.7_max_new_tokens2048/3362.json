  "Explanation": "The 'receiveShipment' method adds items to the stock and checks if the stock is positive and the warehouse is not already open. If both conditions are met, it opens the warehouse. Here, since the initial stock is 0 and the method is called with a positive number of items, the stock becomes positive, triggering the warehouse to open.",
