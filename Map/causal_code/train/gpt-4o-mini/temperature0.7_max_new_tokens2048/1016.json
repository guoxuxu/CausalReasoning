  "Problem": "def calculate_health(score, age, medication):\n    base_health = 100\n    health = base_health - age + score * 10\n    if medication:\n        health += 30\n    return health\n\npatient_score = 8\npatient_age = 40\nmedication_taken = True\n\npatient_health = calculate_health(patient_score, patient_age, medication_taken)\",\n\nIf the patient had a higher score, would his calculated health be higher assuming no changes made to age or medication status?",
  "Explanation": "From cause to effect without intervention: Increasing the 'score' directly increases the 'health' because health is positively correlated with score as indicated by 'health = base_health - age + score * 10'.",
