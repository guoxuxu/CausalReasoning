  "Explanation": "According to the code, the weather status is determined solely by the temperature if it is strictly greater than 20 it will be 'sunny'. Since it increased from 15 to 25 (which is greater than 20), it would be 'sunny.', and there is no intervention on other variables that could change this conclusion.",
