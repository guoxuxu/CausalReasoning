  "Explanation": "Setting the `engineOn` flag to true inside the `accelerate` method would not be effective since the method's condition itself checks whether the engine was on before accelerating. If `engineOn` was initially false when `accelerate` was called, turning it on within the method would not revisit the previously evaluated condition, so the speed would still remain unchanged.",
