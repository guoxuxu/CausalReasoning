  "Explanation": "Increasing the heart rate alone does not necessarily increase the risk level unless it exceeds 100 bpm. If the heart rate remains within the range 60-100 bpm and sleep hours are sufficient, the risk level can stay 'Moderate' or even 'Low'.",

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in heart rate can lead to a higher risk level. A decrease in sleep hours can also lead to a higher risk level. A heart rate over 100 or sleep hours under 6 results in a 'High' risk level. A heart rate between 60 and 100 combined with 6 to 8 sleep hours results in a 'Moderate' risk level. A heart rate below 60 and sleep hours above 8 leads to a 'Low' risk level. Improving sleep increases sleep hours, while reducing heart rate decreases heart rate.",
