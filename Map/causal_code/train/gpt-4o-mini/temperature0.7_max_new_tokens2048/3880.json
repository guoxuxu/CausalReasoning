  "Explanation": "Introducing such a policy will inherently increase the chances of employment for those in good health. The code already has a function (`offer_job`) that prefers to employ individuals in good health, thus an explicit policy makes this causal relationship stricter, enhancing the likelihood of employment for healthy people further.",
