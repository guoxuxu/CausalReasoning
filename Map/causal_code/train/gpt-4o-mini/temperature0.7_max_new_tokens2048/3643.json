  "Problem": "As above\",\n\nIf the plant's growth rate increased significantly, can we conclude that both sunlight and water were sufficient?",
  "Explanation": "From effect to cause without intervention: a significant increase suggests that both sunlight and water conditions were met. However, it's important to note that this question assumes all other variables are constant or sufficient.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
