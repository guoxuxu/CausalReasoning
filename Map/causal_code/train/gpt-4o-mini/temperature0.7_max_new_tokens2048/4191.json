  "Explanation": "Though the pedestrian signal shows 'Walk' when the traffic light is 'Red', we cannot be certain without additional context (such as initial light status or potential overrides in the system) that the cause was the traffic light status being 'Red'. There might be another control mechanism or error not represented in the code.",
