  "Explanation": "Altering 'current_temperature' inside the function does not provide any information or impact the state of 'heater_control'. The change in 'current_temperature' through an intervention does not retroactively influence or reveal the original state of 'heater_control'. Thus, this manipulation does not facilitate a correct deduction from effect to the causative state of the heater control.",
