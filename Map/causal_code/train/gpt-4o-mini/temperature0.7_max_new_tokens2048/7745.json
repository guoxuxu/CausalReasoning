  "Explanation": "Since the grade average calculation and conditional checks are performed within a loop for each student without external interference, any input of grades all above 90 inherently results in an average also above 90, satisfying the condition for receiving a grade of 'A'. No external intervention alters this causal mechanism from input grades to the output grade in the summary.",
