  "Explanation": "With the new threshold set at 75, only a scenario in which the combined effects of winter, rainy conditions, and adjusted threshold converge would result in 'High humidity' being displayed (winter humidity at 30 plus rain at 10 equals 40 under normal conditions; an intervention causing a high enough increase to pass the new threshold implies substantial modifications). Therefore, if 'High humidity' is displayed under these conditions, it strongly indicates a significantly rainy or altered winter environment.",
