  "Explanation": "To change the weather condition from 'Cold' to 'Hot', the 'setTemperature' method must be invoked with a new temperature, necessarily above 30, as per the logic in 'determineWeather'. This is an action or intervention that specifically modifies the temperature to achieve the desired weather state.",
