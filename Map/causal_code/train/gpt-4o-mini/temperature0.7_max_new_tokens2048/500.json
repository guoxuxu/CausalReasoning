  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount): \n    tax_amount = price * tax_rate \n    total_price = price + tax_amount - discount \n    demand = max(0, 100 - total_price) \n    return total_price, demand\n\nprice = 100 \ntax_rate = 0.05 \ndiscount = 10 \n\nrevenue, demand = compute_sales(price, tax_rate, discount) \n\n# Implement a promotional campaign \ndef promotion_effect(demand):\n    new_demand = demand + 20 \n    return new_demand\n\n# Calculate new demand after promotion \nnew_demand = promotion_effect(demand)\",\n\nWith a promotional intervention increasing demand, can we infer that the base price was lowered?",
  "Explanation": "The increase in demand due to the promotional intervention does not imply that the base price was lowered. The increase in demand is solely due to the promotional effect, which adds a fixed number of units to the existing demand unconnected to base price alterations.",
