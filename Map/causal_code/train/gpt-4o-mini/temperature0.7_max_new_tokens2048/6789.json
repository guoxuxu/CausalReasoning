  "Explanation": "The `predict_next_month_sales` method calculates its output by multiplying the sum of `sales_data` with a factor greater than 1 if `increase_factor` is positive. Seeing an increase in `predicted_sales` necessarily implies that `increase_factor` was greater than zero, as that is the only condition under which the multiplication factor exceeds 1, indicating an effect-to-cause inference under intervention.",
