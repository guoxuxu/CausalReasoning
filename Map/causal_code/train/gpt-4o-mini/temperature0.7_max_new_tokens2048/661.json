  "Explanation": "If 'discount' is applied (i.e., not 0), it indicates that 'is_adult' was set to True, which in turn could only be checked if 'age' was present in the data. However, the default discount (0) does not ensure the absence of 'age', as it might still mean the age present specifies a person who is not an adult.",
