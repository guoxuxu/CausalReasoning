  "Explanation": "The action 'shutdown' is set when both status is 'overheat' and safety is 'check'. Based on the provided code, status 'overheat' only occurs if the temperature is over 30 degrees, and safety 'check' only occurs if time is over 5 units. Thus, the action 'shutdown' indirectly indicates both these conditions were true.",
