If we prevent this review, will his salary remain unchanged?",
  "Explanation": "The `reviewPerformance` function is the causal mechanism for changing John's salary, as it conditions salary adjustments (i.e., 10% increase) on the performance rating being over 80. Preventing this review would mean this condition is never checked or met, thus leaving his salary unchanged.",
