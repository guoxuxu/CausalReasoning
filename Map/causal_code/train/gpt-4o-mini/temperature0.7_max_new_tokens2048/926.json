  "Explanation": "Increasing 'filter_value' means only higher data points above the new filter_value are included in 'filtered_data' when 'use_filter' is True. Consequently, the average calculated from potentially fewer and higher-valued data points tends to be higher. Thus, manipulating 'filter_value' will influence the output 'result'.",
