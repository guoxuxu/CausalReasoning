  "Explanation": "Introducing a control that resets the base_price to its original value post-discount neutralizes the effect of the apply_discount() method on the base_price. Consequently, this intervention would prevent any change in the final_price() attributable to the discount, showcasing analysis from cause to effect with intervention.",
