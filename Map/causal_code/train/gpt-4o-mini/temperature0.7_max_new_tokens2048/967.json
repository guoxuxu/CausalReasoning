  "Explanation": "If decrementing instead of incrementing the result for lowercase characters still results in 'Case 2', it implies that the base (predominantly contributed by uppercase characters) was originally strong enough to keep the result between 1000 and 1500 even with negative adjustments from lowercase characters.",
