  "Explanation": "While 'update_heart_rate_based_on_age' increases heart rate based on an increase in age, the heart rate can also increase due to other factors such as exercise ('exercise' method), and not strictly age. Hence, observing a heart rate increase alone cannot definitively confirm an increase in age.",
