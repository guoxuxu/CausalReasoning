  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, customer_type):\n    base_discount = 0.1 if customer_type == 'loyal' else 0\n    seasonal_discount = 0.05 if price > 100 else 0\n    total_discount = base_discount + seasonal_discount\n    discounted_price = price - (price * total_discount)\n    return discounted_price\",\n\nIf an increase in the total amount of discounts applied is observed, can we conclude it's promotional season?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in total discounts could also be caused by a change in customer type to 'loyal', which increases the base discount independent of it being a promotional season. Thus, increases in total discounts cannot conclusively confirm the presence of a promotional season.",
