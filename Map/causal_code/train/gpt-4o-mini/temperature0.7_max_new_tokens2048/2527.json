  "Problem": "Python code provided above.\",\n\nIf 'update_concentration' method is called multiple times for 'CO' with high values, will 'calculate_pollution_index' method result in a higher output?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing 'CO' values will proportionally increase the pollution index since it is directly weighted and summed in the calculation method.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
