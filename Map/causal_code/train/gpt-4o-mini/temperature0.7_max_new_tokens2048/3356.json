  "Explanation": "Lowering the start point of 'thresholds' might impact the elements discarded by the filter condition in 'process_data', but it does not necessarily increase the minimum value of 'cleaned_data' used in the calculation of 'average'. 'cleaned_data' will still contain all elements greater than the respective threshold, which could still be lower than before if the new threshold is lesser than the smallest data point in the list.",
