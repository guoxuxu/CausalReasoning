  "Problem": "def update_score(score, bonus, penalty): \n    new_score = score + bonus - penalty \n    return new_score \n\ninitial_score = 100 \nadditional_bonus = 20 \nextra_penalty = 5 \n\nfinal_score = update_score(initial_score, additional_bonus, extra_penalty)\",\n\nSeeing a final score equal to the sum of the initial score and the bonus, can we conclude the penalty was zero?",
  "Explanation": "If final score ends up being just the addition of the initial score and bonus without any reduction, it implies no penalty was applied. Therefore, one could conclude the penalty was zero.",
