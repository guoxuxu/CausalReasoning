  "Problem": "def price_calculator(age, student, coupon_code):\n    base_price = 100\n    age_discount = 20 if age < 18 else 0\n    student_discount = 10 if student else 0\n    coupon_discount = 30 if coupon_code == 'SAVE30' else 0\n    final_price = base_price - age_discount - student_discount - coupon_discount\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf the final price is 90, does it necessarily imply that the person is a student?",
  "Explanation": "A final price of 90 can be achieved through different combinations of discounts, such as being under 18 or using a 'SAVE30' coupon, aside from just being a student. There's no direct causal relationship that can conclusively determine the person is a student based solely on the final price.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.
