  "Explanation": "While the causal logic in `updateDelay` would usually suggest a traffic level between 50 and 79 for a 'Moderate' delay, manually setting the delay does not affect or reflect the actual traffic level in the system as the traffic level and delay updating mechanisms are independent in terms of direct assignments.",
