  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 25 degrees followed by checkUmbrellaNeed returning false could occur from either the temperature change or a previous state of no rain. Since the method does not revert the state of rain but merely checks condition at the time of invocation, and given that rain is false if temperature alone was considered (as it checks if temperature <= 20), we cannot assert it was raining previously without more information.",
