  "Explanation": "Applying a high penalty directly reduces the scores of those below 50. An accumulative application of this penalty over iterations or a sufficiently high single-time penalty can decrease scores under 50 low enough to push scores that were slightly above 50 below this threshold, especially after they continue to not gain enough bonus to stay above.",
