  "Explanation": "Deliberately reducing humidity affects the 'risk' status to 'low'. However, the alert being not triggered also depends on the 'status' linked to temperature. If the temperature is still resulting in a 'status' of 'hot', reducing humidity alone won't guarantee that the alert isn’t triggered; both conditions ('hot' status and 'high' risk) need to not be met for the alert to not trigger.",
