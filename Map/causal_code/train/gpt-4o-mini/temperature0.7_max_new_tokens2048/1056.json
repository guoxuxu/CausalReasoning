  "Explanation": "From the given code, snowing occurs only when it is raining and the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius. Since no changes to temperature or raining conditions are made, and initially it’s not raining, the condition for snowing is not met. Thus, the system will not naturally lead to snow.",
