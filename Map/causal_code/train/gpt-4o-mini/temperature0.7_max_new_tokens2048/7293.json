  "Explanation": "Setting the weather to 'rainy' sets traffic_delay to True, which subsequently sets the arrival_time to 'late'. This follows the cause to effect chain without intervention.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The weather determines the mood, which is either gloomy or cheerful based on whether it is rainy or sunny. The weather also affects the traffic delay, causing it to be true if it is rainy and false if it is sunny. The traffic delay then influences the arrival time, resulting in being late if there is a traffic delay and on-time if there is none.",
