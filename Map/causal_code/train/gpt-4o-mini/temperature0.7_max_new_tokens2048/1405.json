  "Problem": "def sales_prediction(price, advertising, day_of_week):\n    if day_of_week == 'Sunday':\n        sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.2) * 1.5\n    else:\n        sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.1)\n    return sales\",\n\nIf you could control the day of the week to always be Sunday, how would this impact sales if we increase the advertising budget?",
  "Explanation": "Fixing the day of the week to Sunday amplifies the impact of the advertising budget in the sales equation by using a higher multiplier (1.5 total impact due to 1.2 advertising impact on sales), thus sales will increase more significantly compared to other days.",
