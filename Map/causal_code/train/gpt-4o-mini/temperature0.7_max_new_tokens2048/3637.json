  "Problem": "Python code defined above\",\n\nIf the likelihood of sickness decreases after setting a fixed temperature, can we infer that the original temperature was below 5 degrees Celsius?",
  "Explanation": "If setting the temperature to 10 degrees Celsius results in reduced sickness, it suggests that the previous instances of sickness were indeed influenced by temperatures being below the 5 degrees Celsius threshold.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure. Output strictly in JSON format: {\"causal_relation\": \"A → B; C → D; ...\"}.\n",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
