  "Explanation": "The feels_like method calculates the feels_like temperature based on the original temperature and an adjustment. Given no humidity conditions in the question, and based on the code, humidity does not decrease the feels_like temperature below the original temperature in any scenario, so with a temperature of 40, the output will not be below 40.",
