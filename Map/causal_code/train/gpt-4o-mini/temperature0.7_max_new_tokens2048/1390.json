  "Explanation": "Although an increase in the 'flag_value' (from non-positive to positive) results in a significant output increase (by switching from subtracting 5 to adding 10), a significant increase in the output alone cannot confirm this without knowing changes in the 'data_list'. If 'data_list' values increase significantly, this could also explain the increase in output, revealing knowledge of 'from effect to cause with intervention.' The answer stresses that just observing an effect (output increase) doesn’t validate the specific cause (increase in flag_value) without further data.",
