  "Explanation": "In the provided TrafficSystem class, there is a conditional statement inside the increase_traffic function that activates the traffic lights when the number of cars exceeds 10, assuming the lights were not already on. The increase in cars is the direct cause for the traffic lights to turn on under these conditions.",
