  "Explanation": "An increase in total_sales could be caused by several factors according to the code: reduced discounts leading to higher prices after discount, a decrease in the tax rate leading to relatively less additional cost, or higher initial prices. None of these factors alone, such as an increase in initial prices, can definitively explain the increase in total sales without additional information.",
