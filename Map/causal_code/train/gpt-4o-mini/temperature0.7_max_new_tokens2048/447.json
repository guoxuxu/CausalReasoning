  "Explanation": "According to the '__init__' initialization of the WeatherSimulator, if the temperature is set to 15 degrees, which is below 20, the weather_status will directly change to 'cloudy', regardless of the current humidity value. This is a deterministic change caused directly by the intervention on temperature.",
