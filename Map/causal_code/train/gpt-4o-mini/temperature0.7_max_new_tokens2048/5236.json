  "Explanation": "While not definitive due to potential changes in expenses, in general, higher performance scores, which indicate higher ROI, suggest that sales have increased if the expenses remain constant or have not increased proportionally as much. This is derived by reversing the cause-effect relationship in the performance score calculation.",
