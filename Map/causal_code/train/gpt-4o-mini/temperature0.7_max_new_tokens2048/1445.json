  "Explanation": "By intervening and setting the random increase to 10, the base price becomes 110 before any discounts. Applying a 15% discount results in a price of 110 * 0.85, which equates to 93.5. Therefore, with this intervention, the final discounted price would indeed be consistently set to 93.5.",
