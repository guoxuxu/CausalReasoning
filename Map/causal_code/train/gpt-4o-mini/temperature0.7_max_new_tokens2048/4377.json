  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  updated_data = data * 2\n  final_data = updated_data + 10\n  return final_data\n\nresult = process_data(input_data)\",\n\nIf we subtract 5 from 'input_data' at the beginning of 'process_data', will 'result' decrease?",
  "Explanation": "Starting the 'process_data' function by subtracting 5 from 'input_data' effectively reduces the initial input, which directly influences 'updated_data', being half of its intended value. Consequently, 'final_data' would be lower than expected as it is dependent on 'updated_data', thus decreasing 'result'.",
