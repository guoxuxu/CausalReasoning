  "Explanation": "Increasing the number of units sold beyond 500 triggers a discount which is deducted from the base price. Even though the discount reduces the per-unit price, the overall adjustment factor (`seasonal_factor`) applied afterwards does not change this new base, leading to a potentially lower final price.",
