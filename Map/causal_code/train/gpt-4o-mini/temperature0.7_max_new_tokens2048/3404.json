  "Problem": "class UserAccount { constructor(balance) { this.balance = balance; } deposit(amount) { this.balance += amount; } withdraw(amount) { if (amount <= this.balance) { this.balance -= amount; return true; } else { return false; } } getBalance() { return this.balance; } } const user = new UserAccount(1000); user.deposit(500); const successfulWithdrawal = user.withdraw(1200); const remainingBalance = user.getBalance();\",\n\nIf an additional amount was added before checking the balance, would the balance be higher than if no deposit was made?",
  "Explanation": "Considering an intervention by calling the deposit method (e.g., user.deposit(300)) before calling getBalance, this extra deposit would directly increase the balance in addition to any previous balance. Thus, if this deposit happens compared to when it doesn’t, the balance will indeed be higher.",
