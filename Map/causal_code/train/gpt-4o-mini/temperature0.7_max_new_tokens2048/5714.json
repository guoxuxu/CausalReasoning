  "Problem": "def compute_score(health, age, medication_status):\n    base_score = 100\n    if age > 50:\n        base_score -= (age - 50) * 0.75\n    if health < 5:\n        base_score -= (5 - health) * 20\n    if medication_status == True:\n        base_score += 20\n    return base_score\",\n\nUpon seeing an increase in `base_score`, can we infer that a patient has started taking medication?",
  "Explanation": "An increase in `base_score` can result from taking medication, but it can also be due to improvements in health or age being less than 50, where older detrimental effects do not apply. Since there are multiple reasons leading to an increased score, we cannot conclusively infer that taking medication is the reason without additional information.",
