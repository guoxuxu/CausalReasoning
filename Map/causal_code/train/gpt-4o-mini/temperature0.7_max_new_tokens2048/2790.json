  "Explanation": "The increaseTemperature() method first checks if the heater is off. If it is off, it turns it on before increasing the temperature by 5 degrees. Hence, if the temperature increased, the heater must have been turned on, indicating a cause (turning heater on) to effect (increase in temperature) relationship without any external intervention.",
