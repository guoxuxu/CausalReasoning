The function calculates the weighted sum of corresponding elements in each sub-list of `data` using `weights` and returns a list of these sums.\"\n  },\n\nIf the weights list contains larger values, will the resultant scores generally increase?",
  "Explanation": "Since the scores are computed as the weighted sum of data points and increasing the weights increases each term in the sum, the total scores will generally be higher as a result.",
