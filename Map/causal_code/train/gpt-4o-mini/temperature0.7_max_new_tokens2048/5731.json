  "Explanation": "In the given function, the infection rate is calculated as (infected / population) * base_rate, possibly adjusted by effectiveness if preventative measures are active. Assuming the number of infected does not change, an increase in the population decreases the ratio (infected/population), thereby reducing the infection rate.",
