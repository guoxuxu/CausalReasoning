  "Problem": "def update_status(temperature, rainfall):\n    if temperature > 30 and rainfall < 10:\n        status = 'drought'\n    elif temperature < 0 and rainfall > 50:\n        status = 'flood'\n    else:\n        status = 'normal'\n    return status\n\ndef send_alert(status):\n    if status == 'drought':\n        alert_sent = True\n    elif status == 'flood':\n        alert_sent = True\n    else:\n        alert_sent = False\n    return alert_sent\",\n\nIf an alert was sent, can we deduce that there was either a drought or a flood?",
  "Explanation": "The `send_alert` function sends an alert if the status is either 'drought' or 'flood'. Therefore, if an alert was sent, it implies that the only statuses that could trigger this are 'drought' or 'flood'.",
