  "Explanation": "Based on the code, 'Cool and Dry' condition is set only when both temperature is less than or equal to 30 and humidity is less than or equal to 50. Therefore, this effect (weather_condition being 'Cool and Dry') reliably suggests that the cause (temperature being less than or equal to 30) is true.",
