  "Explanation": "Lowering the age criteria to 60 means a 62-year-old could qualify based on age alone, eliminating the requirement to be jobless or have a chronic disease paired with a lack of insurance. Therefore, being eligible doesn't necessarily provide information about their job status or health conditions.",
