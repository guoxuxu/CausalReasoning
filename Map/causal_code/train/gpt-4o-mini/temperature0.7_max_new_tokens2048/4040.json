  "Problem": "def calculate_profit(revenue, costs, tax_rate): \n    profit_before_tax = revenue - costs \n    tax = profit_before_tax * tax_rate \n    profit_after_tax = profit_before_tax - tax \n    return profit_after_tax\",\n\nIf we fix the costs and tax_rate, and then increase the revenue, will the profit_after_tax increase?",
  "Explanation": "With costs and tax_rate fixed, the only variable affecting profit_before_tax is revenue. Therefore, increasing revenue will increase profit_before_tax, which will consequently increase the amount of tax paid but still result in a higher profit_after_tax. Thus, by intervening to hold costs and tax_rate steady, the causal effect of increasing revenue directly leads to an increase in profit_after_tax.",
