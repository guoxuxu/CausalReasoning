  "Explanation": "The function `decide_activity` maps 'sunny' weather to the activity 'picnic'. Consequently, 'picnic' as an activity in the function `choose_food` directly results in choosing 'sandwiches' as the food. Thus, there is a direct causal path from sunny weather to eating sandwiches without any intervention required.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
