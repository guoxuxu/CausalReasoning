  "Problem": "WeatherSimulation class definition with methods change_temperature and artificial_sun\",\n\nIf an artificial intervention makes the weather sunny using artificial_sun, can we conclude the temperature is above 20 degrees Celsius?",
  "Explanation": "The intervention artificially sets the weather to sunny and does not indicate actual temperature conditions.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
