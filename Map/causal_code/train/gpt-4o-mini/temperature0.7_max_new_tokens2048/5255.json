  "Explanation": "Calling 'toggle_heater' with true results in false. Thus, 'heater_on' is false when passed to 'update_temperature', leading to a drop in temperature instead of an increase. Hence the assumption is wrong but the causal relationship between heater state to temperature increase is correct when the heater changes to 'on'.",
