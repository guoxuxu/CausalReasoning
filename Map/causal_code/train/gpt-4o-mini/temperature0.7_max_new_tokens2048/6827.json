  "Explanation": "Although one scenario where 'heater_on' is True is when 'current_temp' is significantly lower than 'desired_temp', 'heater_on' being True does not exclusively specify this condition because the initial temperature state is inadequately communicated by 'heater_on' alone. There could be other uncontrolled factors affecting this observed outcome.",
