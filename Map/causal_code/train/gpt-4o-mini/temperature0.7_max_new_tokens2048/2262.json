  "Explanation": "Setting the weather_status to 'Arid' as an intervention doesn't necessarily indicate the natural cause (e.g., temperature). An external interference in status does not reveal the reason behind such a status; the condition could be due to low humidity (< 30) or low temperature (< -5) alone, or a combination of any.",
