  "Explanation": "In the given code, if the marketing campaign is not active, the revenue would not increase by 20%. Hence, the profit calculated as `revenue - costs` would decrease compared to the scenario where the campaign is active. The profit is directly affected by the terms in the calculation which here is influenced by the revenue increase due to the marketing campaign.",
