  "Explanation": "With the intervention to increase discount by an extra 0.05 for everyone over 30, a 35 years old, initially receiving a 0.2 discount, will now receive 0.25 (0.2 initial + 0.05 increase). This question bridges an understanding that a direct cause (age over 30) with an additional intervention (extra discount) results in an effect (total discount of 0.25).",
