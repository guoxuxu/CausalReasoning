  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, volume, tax_rate): \n    tax_amount = price * volume * tax_rate \n    total_sales = (price * volume) + tax_amount \n    return total_sales\",\n\nIf a government policy sets a minimum price, will total_sales increase?",
  "Explanation": "Setting a minimum price (an intervention) likely increases the base price if the minimum is higher than the current price. According to the function, total_sales depends positively on price. Therefore, this policy intervention would indirectly increase total_sales by increasing the base price.",
