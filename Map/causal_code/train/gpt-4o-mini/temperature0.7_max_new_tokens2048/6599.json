  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(num_sales, num_returns, advertising_budget):\n    revenue = num_sales * 100 - num_returns * 25\n    advertising_effectiveness = (num_sales / advertising_budget) if advertising_budget > 0 else 0\n    return revenue, advertising_effectiveness\",\n\nIf the revenue decreases, can we infer that the number of returns has increased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'revenue' may result from either an increase in 'num_returns' or a decrease in 'num_sales', or both. It is not possible to conclusively determine the increase in 'num_returns' just from the decrease in 'revenue' without additional data on 'num_sales'.",
