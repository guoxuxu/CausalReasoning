  "Problem": "def update_temperature(location, date, adjustment):\n    base_temp = weather_api.get_temperature(location, date)\n    if location == 'desert':\n        adjusted_temp = base_temp + adjustment * 1.5\n    else:\n        adjusted_temp = base_temp + adjustment\n    return adjusted_temp\",\n\nIf 'adjusted_temp' equals 'base_temp', has the 'adjustment' been necessarily set to zero?",
  "Explanation": "Given the logic in the code, the only scenario where 'adjusted_temp' equates to 'base_temp' without external manipulation is when 'adjustment' is zero. Any non-zero 'adjustment' would modify 'base_temp', regardless of location (either through direct addition or the desert-specific multiplication), leading to an 'adjusted_temp' different from 'base_temp'.",
