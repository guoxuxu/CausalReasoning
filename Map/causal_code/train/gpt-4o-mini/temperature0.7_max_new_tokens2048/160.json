  "Explanation": "Even though setting the season to 'summer' could affect the temperature and humidity, reversing the outcome of `is_rainy()` from True to False isn't certain without knowing the specific changes that the intervention of setting the season to 'summer' entails. It depends if the new temperature and humidity values still meet the conditions for `is_rainy()` to return True. Hence, intervention from the effect to cause is uncertain without knowing the specifics of how 'summer' adjustment impacts the attributes.",
