  "Explanation": "Observing that 'willPlantsSurvive()' returns false suggests that it is not raining and the temperature is over 30 degrees. However, if the temperature is known to be lower than 30, then we can infer that it is not raining; if the temperature isn't known, then we cannot infer the state of 'isRaining' from 'willPlantsSurvive()' alone.",
