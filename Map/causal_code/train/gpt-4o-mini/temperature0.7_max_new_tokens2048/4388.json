  "Explanation": "High sales figures, specified as 200 to 250, suggest a warm and non-rainy day. However, sales figures in the range of 150 to 200 can occur on a cool day or a warm non-rainy day, making it impossible to definitively conclude the weather conditions just from high sales.",

On warm, non-rainy days with temperatures of 75 or above, sales are high (200 to 250), while non-rainy days with temperatures below 75 yield moderate sales (150 to 200).",
