  "Explanation": "If rain is observed, it can be inferred that the new temperature might have been set below 10 or kept the same as per the initial conditions due to the logic implemented in the adjustWeather method.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature influences the rain status, where a temperature below 10 degrees causes it to rain, while a temperature above 30 degrees prevents it from raining. Additionally, the new temperature directly affects the rain status set in the adjustWeather method. The temperature also determines whether an umbrella is needed, based on the combination of temperature being below 15 degrees and it raining. Lastly, the rain status affects the decision to check for an umbrella.",
