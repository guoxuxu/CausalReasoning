  "Explanation": "Initially, the plant receives suboptimal water (150 ml), insufficient for the optimal rate but enough to avoid 0 growth. Increasing the water to 250 ml satisfies the optimal water requirement, potentially increasing the growth rate by 1 point as other conditions remain within acceptable non-zero growth thresholds.",
