  "Explanation": "Keeping the tax rate constant while increasing discounts will lower the discounted prices. Since the taxed prices are calculated as discounted prices plus a constant tax rate, the increase in discounts will lead to lower taxed prices and, thus, a probable decrease in total sales. These calculations do not consider potential changes in purchasing behavior due to lower prices.",
