  "Problem": "...\",\n\nIf we artificially modify the code to maximize plant growth (override the `grow_plants` method to always increase plant growth by 20), will this intervention cause an increase in the herbivore population?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing plant growth to consistently 20, regardless of sunlight, provides a sustained food source for herbivores, which should increase their population according to the `feed_herbivores` method, as they respond to plant growth of 15 or more.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
