  "Explanation": "A 'final_score' of 20 directly indicates that 'favorite_shown' was False as it guarantees that the magic_number remains 5 and thus, when added to 10, always equals 20. Higher scores could still occur with 'favorite_shown' being True, but low scores near 20 cannot be obtained if 'favorite_shown' were True due to the addition of the random number.",
