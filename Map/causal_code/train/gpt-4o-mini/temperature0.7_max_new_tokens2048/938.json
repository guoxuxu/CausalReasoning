  "Explanation": "By intervening to change the body of 'should_augment' to always return True, we're ensuring that regardless of data length, the condition to execute 'augment' in 'process_data' will always be met. This is a clear causal direction from the intervention (modifying 'should_augment') to the effect ('augment' being employed).",
