  "Explanation": "In the original code, John's health status is determined by both the environment's pollution level and his diet quality. Once the pollution level exceeds 50, if his diet quality is 7 or less, his health status is set to 'Poor'. Increasing pollution will maintain or worsen his health status if other variables remain constant.",
