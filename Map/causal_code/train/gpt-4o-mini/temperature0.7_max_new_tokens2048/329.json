  "Explanation": "Changing the 'customer_type' influences the discount rate in 'compute_discount', which in turn affects 'final_price' outcome by reducing the intermediate 'discounted_price' more. This represents a causal path from cause to effect without intervention as altering the 'customer_type' directly affects the final price.",
