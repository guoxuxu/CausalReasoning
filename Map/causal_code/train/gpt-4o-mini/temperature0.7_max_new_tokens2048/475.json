  "Explanation": "The `adjustTemperature` method controls both the state of `heaterOn` and `temperature` simultaneously. Just setting `heaterOn` to true externally does not change `temperature` in the given code. There's no code segment detected for automatic adjustment of temperature based on the heater's state alone, thus intervention does not lead to the expected automatic result.",
