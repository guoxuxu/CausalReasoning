  "Explanation": "Although a 'poor' health status can arise from having a vitamin D level below 30, it can also be due to high age coupled with no exercise, irrespective of the person's vitamin D levels. Additional data on exercise frequency or explicit vitamin D levels is needed to make this determination.",
