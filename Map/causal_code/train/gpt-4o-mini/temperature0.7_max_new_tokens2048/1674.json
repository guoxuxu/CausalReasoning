  "Explanation": "An averaged increase in 'final_result' doesn't necessarily imply that the increment for even numbers was increased. It could result from the initial distribution of 'data_list' containing higher or differently spaced numbers, or a combination of even and odd handling in the unaltered process. Specific knowledge or observation of the modification to the function is necessary to confirm such a change.",
