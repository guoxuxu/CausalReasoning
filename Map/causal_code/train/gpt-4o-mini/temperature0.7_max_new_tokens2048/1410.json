  "Explanation": "Increasing the humidity would generally increase the feels_like temperature. If John is not wearing a coat, this likely implies the feels_like temperature is already in a comfortable range. Further increasing the humidity/feels_like temperature would make it less likely, not more, for John to wear a coat.",
