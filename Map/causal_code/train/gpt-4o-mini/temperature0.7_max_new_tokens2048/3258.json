  "Explanation": "Since `updateDiet('healthy')` sets `hasHealthyDiet` to true and automatically calls `updateHealthStatus()`, the health status could improve based on the previous value of `exercisesRegularly`. The improvement is direct and doesn't require any external method calls beyond the diet update.",
