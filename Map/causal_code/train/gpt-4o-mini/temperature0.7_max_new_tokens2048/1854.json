  "Problem": "Described above in text section.\",\n\nIf the chosen activity is 'reading', can we infer that the temperature was below 20 degrees?",
  "Explanation": "While 'reading' can be the chosen activity when it's not hot (temperature ≤ 20 degrees), it can also be the choice when the mood is not 'bored' or there isn't enough time (> 2 hours) regardless of the temperature. Hence, the activity 'reading' does not exclusively depend on the temperature being below 20.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
