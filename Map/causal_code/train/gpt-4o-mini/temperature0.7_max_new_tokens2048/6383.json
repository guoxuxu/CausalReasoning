  "Explanation": "In the 'health_status' method, improving exercise frequency from 'none' or 'low' to 'moderate' or 'high' directly contributes to a better health status classification, as it reduces the likelihood of being in 'poor' or 'average' health according to the conditions specified in the method.",
