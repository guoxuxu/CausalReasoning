  "Explanation": "A 'High' risk profile indicates that the total funds exceed 100000, but this could be due to the initial investment amount itself being high, not necessarily from adding funds. Thus, there isn't a definitive reverse causal inference from the high risk profile to the action of adding a large amount of funds.",
