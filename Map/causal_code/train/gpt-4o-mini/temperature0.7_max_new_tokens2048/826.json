  "Explanation": "Setting the humidity to 10 and invoking adjust_weather (via set_humidity) would update weather_condition to 'Dry' if the temperature does not imply a 'Cold' condition (i.e., temperature is above 10 degrees). This is because the 'Dry' condition is linked to a low humidity (< 30) while other conditions are not met.",
