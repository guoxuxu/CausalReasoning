  "Explanation": "In the code, 'final_score' is calculated as 'base_score' + 'bonus' - 'penalty'. An increase in 'base_score' directly increases 'final_score' since 'bonus' and 'penalty' remain unchanged in this scenario. This reflects a direct causal relationship from 'base_score' (cause) to 'final_score' (effect) without any intervention.",
