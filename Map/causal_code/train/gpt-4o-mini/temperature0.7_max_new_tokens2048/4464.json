  "Explanation": "A decrease in 'total_sales' cannot be solely attributed to setting the 'season' to 'winter'. Decreases in sales could result from various factors including an increase in the 'discount_rate', changes in consumer buying behavior, fewer units sold, or external market conditions. The causality from season to sales cannot be established without additional data and isolation of variables.",
