  "Problem": "def update_prices(prices, adjustment_factor, demand, supply):\n    if supply > demand:\n        adjustment_factor *= 0.9\n    else:\n        adjustment_factor *= 1.1\n    new_prices = {product: price * adjustment_factor for product, price in prices.items()}\n    return new_prices\",\n\nIf you could control the adjustment_factor to make it increase, should you decrease the supply?",
  "Explanation": "By artificially manipulating the input variables, decreasing the supply relative to demand moves us from the 'if' block to the 'else' block where the adjustment_factor is increased by multiplying it by 1.1. Thus, reducing supply in this situation leads directly to an increase in adjustment_factor.",
