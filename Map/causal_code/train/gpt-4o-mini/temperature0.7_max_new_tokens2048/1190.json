  "Explanation": "Applying a zero discount rate simply retains the basePrice as the initial value for the finalPrice. When calculateTax is subsequently applied, the introduction of tax affects the finalPrice based on the unchanged basePrice, hence the prior application of a zero discount doesn’t alter the inevitability of a tax increase on the finalPrice.",
