  "Explanation": "Altering filter_threshold changes which elements of data_list are included in clean_data. A higher threshold excludes more items, potentially lowering the summary, whereas a lower threshold includes more items, potentially increasing the summary. Thus, intervention by modifying filter_threshold directly affects the result.",
