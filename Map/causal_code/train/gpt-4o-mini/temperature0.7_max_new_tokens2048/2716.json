  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, is_holiday):\n    if is_holiday:\n        discount = 0.15\n    else:\n        discount = 0.05\n\n    final_price = price * (1 - discount)\n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we manually set the discount to 0.15, will this simulate the effect of a holiday on the final_price?",
  "Explanation": "Manually setting the discount to 0.15 applies the same discount rate as during a holiday, thus the final_price will be reduced by the same percentage as it would be on a holiday.",
