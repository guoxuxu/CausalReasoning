  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"This Python code calculates the net earnings of a freelancer who receives various project fees and has some expenses. It applies a tax deduction depending on the net income.\",\n    \"code\": \"def calculate_net_earnings(project_fees, expenses):\n    gross_income = sum(project_fees)\n    net_income = gross_income - expenses\n    if net_income > 100000:\n        tax = 0.3\n    elif net_income > 50000:\n        tax = 0.2\n    else:\n        tax = 0.1\n    return net_income - (net_income * tax)\"\n  },\n\nIf expenses are maintained at a constant value, and project fees increase, will this result in increased net earnings?",
  "Explanation": "By holding expenses constant and increasing project fees, the gross income increases, leading to a higher net income. Since the tax rate brackets depend solely on net income levels, and higher gross income translates to potentially higher or the same net income post-tax, net earnings will increase.",
