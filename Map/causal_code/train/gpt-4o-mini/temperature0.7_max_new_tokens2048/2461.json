  "Explanation": "Modifying the process_data function to multiply by 3 instead of 2 increases the output for any given data_sample. For a data_sample of 4, the original processing (4*2+5=13) would result in 'low', whereas the intervention (4*3+5=17) would still result in 'low', but the probability of hitting 'high' is closer and could be affected by this change for other values.",
