  "Explanation": "Intervening by using the 'increase_prices' method adds a fixed amount to each original price, subsequently leading to higher priced items even after re-applying the same discount rates. Thus, the post-increase final prices calculated after this intervention will be higher compared to the initial_final_prices calculated without this price increment.",
