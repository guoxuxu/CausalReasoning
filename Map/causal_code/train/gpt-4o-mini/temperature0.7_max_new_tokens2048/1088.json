The total sale price is calculated based on the unit price, quantity, available discounts, and whether a promotion is applied. The constructor initializes the variables and the total is calculated with these given parameters. This code exemplifies dependencies between variables such as when a promotion affects the discount applied.\"\n  },\n\nIf the basePrice is increased, will the calculated total increase without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the basePrice directly increases the initial calculation of 'total' (total = basePrice * quantity). Since no other parameters are altered, the total sales value increases if the base price increases.",
