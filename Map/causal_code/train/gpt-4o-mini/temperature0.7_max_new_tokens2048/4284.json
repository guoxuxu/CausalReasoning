  "Explanation": "Setting 'tax_rate' to zero effectively removes 'tax' from the revenue equation, making 'final_revenue' equivalent to 'base_revenue'. An increase in 'prices' will still increase 'base_revenue', directly raising the 'final_revenue', independent of tax considerations.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in prices leads to an increase in base revenue, which in turn increases final revenue. Units sold also contribute to base revenue, affecting final revenue as well. The tax is calculated from base revenue and tax rate, but if the tax rate is zero, tax does not contribute to final revenue.",
