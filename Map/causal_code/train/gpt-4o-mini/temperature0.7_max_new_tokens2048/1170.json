  "Explanation": "Intervening by fixing 'modified_data' at 100 means 'final_data' becomes a simple sum of 100 + 100, which is always 200, irrespective of the input to 'process_data'. This intervention creates a direct causal link between the intervention and the output.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
