  "Explanation": "In the code, 'new_inventory' is calculated by subtracting 'sold_units' from 'current_inventory' and adding 'restocked_units'. Increasing 'units_sold' directly decreases 'new_inventory', because you subtract a larger number from the 'current_inventory'. This demonstrates how changing the cause (units sold) affects the effect (new inventory) without any intervention on other variables.",
