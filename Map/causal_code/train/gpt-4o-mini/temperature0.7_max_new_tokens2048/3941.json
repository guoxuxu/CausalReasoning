  "Explanation": "The output changing to 'High' upon setting the temperature below 20 does not necessarily mean that the initial humidity was less than 80. It could have been above 80 originally, and the temperature was perhaps the only factor preventing a 'High' output previously. Thus, this doesn't conclusively allow us to infer the initial state of the humidity.",
