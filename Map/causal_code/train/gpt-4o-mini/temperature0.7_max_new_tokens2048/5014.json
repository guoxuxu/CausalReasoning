  "Explanation": "In the context of the provided code, the only mechanism by which 'current_temp' could increase (barring unexpected or undocumented behavior) is if 'is_heating_on' is True and the temperature conditions within the specified thresholds are met. Thus, an increase in 'current_temp' under these circumstances strongly suggests that 'is_heating_on' must have been activated to counteract the external cooling.",
