  "Explanation": "Setting 'flag' to False changes the formula inside the function to subtract 5 from the sum of 'data'. However, if 'data' contains numbers that total to a sum slightly less or more than when 'flag' was True plus 10, the output might not necessarily decrease (especially near the boundary values like sum 'data' returning 15 when flag was True versus 10 when false).",
