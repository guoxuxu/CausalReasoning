  "Problem": "class UserAccount { constructor(balance) { this.balance = balance; } deposit(amount) { this.balance += amount; } withdraw(amount) { if (amount <= this.balance) { this.balance -= amount; return true; } else { return false; } } getBalance() { return this.balance; } } const user = new UserAccount(1000); user.deposit(500); const successfulWithdrawal = user.withdraw(1200); const remainingBalance = user.getBalance();\",\n\nGiven a lower balance than expected, can we conclude a specific amount was withdrawn if we know a withdrawal had occurred?",
  "Explanation": "Even though a withdrawal decreases the balance, without knowing the exact amount withdrawn, we cannot conclude the specific amount withdrawn solely based on the balance being lower. Different withdrawal amounts can result in the same final balance due to various prior transactions affecting the initial balance.",
