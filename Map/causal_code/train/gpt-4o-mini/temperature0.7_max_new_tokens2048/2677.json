  "Explanation": "Lower sales can be influenced by various factors including market conditions and other uncontrolled events. Even if improving the ad quality to 'High' might increase future conversions, this does not mean it necessarily was the cause for previous low sales, especially without knowing the prior state of ad quality or other intervening influences.",
