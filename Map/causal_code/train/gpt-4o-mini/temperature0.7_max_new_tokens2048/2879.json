  "Explanation": "Given the code logic, the only way for processed_list to contain only even numbers under the given operations (without any intervention) is if every input number was even. This is because odd numbers are made even only through addition of 10 in the else block, which changes them to even numbers; thus altering the sequence to be comprised of only even numbers but with higher values.",
