  "Explanation": "Increasing the age filter will likely exclude some individuals who are between the ages of 31 and 40. If the removed group had a different average salary than the overall group, then the average salary for the remaining group will change. This assumes no intervention and traces the impact of the cause (age threshold change) on the effect (average salary change).",
