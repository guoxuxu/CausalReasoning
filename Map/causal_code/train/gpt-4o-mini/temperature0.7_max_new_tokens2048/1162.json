  "Explanation": "When `remove_item(200)` is executed before applying a 0.1 discount, the total is recalculated first with one item removed. Therefore, when the discount is subsequently applied, the resultant `total` will be based on the smaller sum and hence will not be the same as if the discount were applied first with all items still included.",
