  "Explanation": "Changing 'holiday' from False to True increases the 'discount' by 0.1. An increased discount leads to the 'final_price' being lower because it's calculated as 'base_price * (1 - discount)'. Therefore, the decrease in 'final_price' is a direct consequence of the holiday effect causing an increase in discount.",
