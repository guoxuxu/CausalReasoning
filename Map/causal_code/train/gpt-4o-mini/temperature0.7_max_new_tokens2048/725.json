  "Explanation": "In the code, the 'profitable' flag is only set to True when 'profit' (which is 'sales' minus 'expenses') is greater than 50000. Thus, if 'profitable' is True, it necessarily means 'sales' were higher than 'expenses'. However, this doesn't specify by how much they must be higher, only that profit must be exceeding 50000.",
