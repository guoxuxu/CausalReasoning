  "Explanation": "While a 'stormy' forecast does occur when wind speed is over 15 m/s based on the code logic, we cannot conclusively determine that the wind speed was altered or specifically set to exceed 15 m/s. This is because the original wind speed might already have been sufficient for a 'stormy' forecast or other factors could have been manipulated, affecting the outcome.",
