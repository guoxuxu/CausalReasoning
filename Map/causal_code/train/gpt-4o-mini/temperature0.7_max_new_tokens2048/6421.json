  "Explanation": "The launch of the marketing campaign increases the initial influence by a normally distributed random effect (campaign_effect). Since new influence affects new popularity, which in turn affects new revenue, an increase in initial influence through the marketing campaign leads directly to an increase in new revenue, illustrating a causal from cause to effect with intervention.",
