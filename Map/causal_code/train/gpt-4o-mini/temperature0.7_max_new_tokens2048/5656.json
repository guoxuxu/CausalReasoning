  "Explanation": "While the reverse causal inference is typically harder to confirm and generally requires an understanding of all potential factors, the code's logic directly ties a significant decrease in wildlife to crossing a pollution threshold. However, causation should be inferred cautiously in real-world scenarios due to potential confounding variables not covered in the code.",
