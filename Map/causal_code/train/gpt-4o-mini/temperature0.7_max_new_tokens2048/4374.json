  "Explanation": "With the intervention of adding 30 units to the inventory (restocking), fulfilling a 25 unit order becomes feasible as it does not exceed the newly updated stock level. This is a straightforward application of intervention from cause (restocking) to effect (ability to fulfill large orders).",
