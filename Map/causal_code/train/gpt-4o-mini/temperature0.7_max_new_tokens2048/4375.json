  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n  updated_data = data * 2\n  final_data = updated_data + 10\n  return final_data\n\nresult = process_data(input_data)\",\n\nIf 'input_data' is doubled, will 'result' definitely increase?",
  "Explanation": "In the function 'process_data', 'input_data' is first multiplied by 2 and assigned to 'updated_data'. Thus, doubling 'input_data' increases 'updated_data' proportionally. The 'final_data' then adds 10 to 'updated_data', directly passing this increase through to 'result'. Hence, if 'input_data' is increased, 'result' will correspondingly increase.",
