  "Explanation": "Increasing the discount from 15% to 25% increases the demand_increase from 10 to 15. However, it also results in a larger reduction in price per unit after the discount is applied. This price reduction can outweigh the effect of increased demand, leading to a potential decrease in overall revenue.",
