  "Explanation": "From cause (threshold) to effect (category), changing the threshold from 50 to 40 affects whether the value 60 exceeds the threshold or not, which in turn determines if the category is 'High' or 'Low'. Here, since 60 would still exceed 40, the category remains 'High'. However, the change in threshold definitely affects the decision path.",
