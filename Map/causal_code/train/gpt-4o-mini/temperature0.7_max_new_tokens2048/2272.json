The sentiment tagging can occasionally fail due to API timeouts.\",\n        \"Code\": \"def categorize_post(post):\n    keywords = extract_keywords(post.content)\n    category = determine_category(keywords)\n    return category\n\ndef tag_sentiment(post):\n    try:\n        sentiment = sentiment_analysis_api(post.content)\n    except TimeoutError:\n        sentiment = 'Unknown'\n    post.sentiment = sentiment\n    return sentiment\n\ndef publish_post(post):\n    category = categorize_post(post)\n    sentiment = tag_sentiment(post)\n    database.save(post.category, post.sentiment, post.content)\n    return 'Post Published'\"\n    },\n\nCan an increase in posts tagged with 'Unknown' sentiment indicate issues in the sentiment analysis API?",
  "Explanation": "Since 'Unknown' tags are primarily applied when there is a TimeoutError during sentiment analysis, an increase in such tags could suggest problems (like decreased responsiveness or failures) with the sentiment analysis API.",
