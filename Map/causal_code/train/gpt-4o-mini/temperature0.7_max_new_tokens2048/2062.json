  "Explanation": "Higher total sales could be a result of either higher prices or more units sold; however, without knowing the specific values of prices or discounts, we can only infer that higher units sold is a plausible cause for higher total sales.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
