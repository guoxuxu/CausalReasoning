  "Explanation": "Increasing the `discount_rate` will lead to a larger discount amount once applied but only if `total_sales` surpasses `discount_threshold`. This could lower the `total_after_discount`, which could decrease or neutralize expected increases in `final_total` due to the smaller base for tax calculation, despite the higher `discount_rate`.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Higher total_sales leads to a higher discount if it exceeds the discount_threshold, which reduces total_after_discount. A higher discount_rate increases the discount amount, potentially reducing final_total. Tax is applied to total_after_discount, influencing final_total.
