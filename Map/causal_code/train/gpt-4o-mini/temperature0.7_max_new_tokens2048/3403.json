  "Problem": "class UserAccount { constructor(balance) { this.balance = balance; } deposit(amount) { this.balance += amount; } withdraw(amount) { if (amount <= this.balance) { this.balance -= amount; return true; } else { return false; } } getBalance() { return this.balance; } } const user = new UserAccount(1000); user.deposit(500); const successfulWithdrawal = user.withdraw(1200); const remainingBalance = user.getBalance();\",\n\nIf the balance is less after a transaction, does it imply a withdrawal was made?",
  "Explanation": "The withdraw method decreases the balance only if a withdrawal occurs and there are sufficient funds (amount <= this.balance). Since the user.withdraw(1200) is called and returns true, it implies that a withdrawal of 1200 was successfully made reducing the balance.",
