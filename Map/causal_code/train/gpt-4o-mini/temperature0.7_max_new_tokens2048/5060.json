  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(sales, costs, economy_factor):\n    sales_increase = sales * (1 + economy_factor / 100)\n    expenses = costs * (1.05)\n    profit = sales_increase - expenses\n    return profit\n\n# Example usage\neconomy_factor = 3\nsales = 150000\ncosts = 50000\nprofit = compute_metrics(sales, costs, economy_factor)\",\n\nIf profit decreases, does this imply that economy_factor has decreased?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in profit can result from different factors within the function, not just a decrease in economy_factor. For instance, increased 'costs' can also reduce 'profit'. Therefore, profit decrease is not solely indicative of a decrease in economy_factor.",
