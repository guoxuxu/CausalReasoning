  "Explanation": "Although an increase in daily steps beyond 10,000 decreases weight, weight could also change due to changes in calorie intake (eating more than 700 calories increases the weight by 0.2). Thus, weight decrease alone doesn't definitively indicate an increase in steps as the cause without knowing the food intake.",
