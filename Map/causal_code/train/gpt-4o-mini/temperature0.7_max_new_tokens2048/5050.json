  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, discount, volume): \n\\tfinal_price = price * (1 - discount)\n\\ttotal_sales = final_price * volume\n\\treturn total_sales\n\nprice = 20\nvolume = 100\ndiscount = 0.1\ntotal = calculate_sales(price, discount, volume)\",\n\nIf we control and set `total_sales` to equal the product of `price` and `volume` by setting `discount` to zero, does it mean `price` has decreased if `total_sales` subsequently decreases?",
  "Explanation": "By controlling `discount` at zero, `final_price` becomes purely a function of `price`. Thus, any observed decrease in `total_sales` must be due directly to a decrease in `price` since `volume` is held constant and `discount` is not influencing the `final_price`.",
