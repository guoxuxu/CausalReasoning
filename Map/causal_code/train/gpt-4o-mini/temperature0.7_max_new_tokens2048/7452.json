  "Explanation": "With this intervention policy, an increase in 'final_price' would lead to a maximized 'discount'. If 'final_price' then decreases, it suggests that the increase in 'discount' isn't solely responsible; rather, a likely reduction in 'price' or 'demand_factor' must have contributed, since the 'discount' has been adjusted to be maximally high already.",
