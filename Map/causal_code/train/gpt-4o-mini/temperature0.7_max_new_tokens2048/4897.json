  "Explanation": "Since the failure condition is linked to a high temperature of over 50, actively reducing the temperature by adjusting the settings to 'decrease' (which results in a 10 degree reduction from the adjusted or ambient temperature above 50), will likely bring it out of the failure threshold.",
