  "Explanation": "Yes, if the output is a linear transformation of new_data, a linear model was used. If the output is binary (true/false based on a threshold comparison), a decision tree was used. Thus, the method of prediction indicates the algorithm used in training, establishing a causal pathway from effect to cause without intervention.",
