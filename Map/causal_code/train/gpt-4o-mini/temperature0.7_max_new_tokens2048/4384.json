  "Explanation": "A reduced 'final_total' can result from either a reduction in 'discounts', 'prices', or both, which affects the 'total' amount before 'tax_amount' is calculated, or directly from a different 'tax_rate'. We cannot definitively infer that 'tax_rate' reduction was the cause without specific information on 'prices' and 'discounts'.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Lower discounts and/or lower prices lead to lower discounted prices, which in turn leads to a lower total. A lower total results in a reduced tax amount, and this reduced tax amount contributes to a lower final total.
