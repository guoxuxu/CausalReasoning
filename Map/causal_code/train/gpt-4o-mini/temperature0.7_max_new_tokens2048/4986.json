  "Explanation": "With every item showing a price reduction of exactly 25%, the only possible configuration in the given code is where 'is_member' is True (initial discount_rate = 0.05) and 'promo_code' is 'SAVE20' (which adds an extra 0.20 to the discount rate). This combination would result in a total discount_rate of 0.25. There are no other code paths that produce a 25% discount.",
