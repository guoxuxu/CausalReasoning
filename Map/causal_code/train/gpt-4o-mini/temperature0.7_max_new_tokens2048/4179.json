  "Explanation": "An increase in 's2' could result from either a positive 'D', which doubles 's1', or substantial increases in 'A', 'B', and/or decreases in 'C' outweighing any negative impact of 'D' <= 0 (where 's2' would be 's1' - 10). Without additional information specifically about 'D', we cannot conclusively determine the reason for increase in 's2'.",
