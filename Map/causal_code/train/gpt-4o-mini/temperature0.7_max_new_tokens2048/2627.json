  "Problem": "def compute_sales(price, volume, discount, holiday):\n                      base_price = price * (1 - discount)\n                      if holiday:\n                          extra_fee = 10\n                          sales = (base_price + extra_fee) * volume\n                      else:\n                          sales = base_price * volume\n                      return sales\",\n\nWithout changing any inputs, if 'sales' decreases significantly, can this imply that a 'holiday' recently ended?",
  "Explanation": "The code applies an additional 'extra_fee' of 10 to the 'base_price' on holidays. If 'sales' decreases significantly without any changes in other variables such as 'price', 'volume', or 'discount', this could imply that a 'holiday' ended, removing the 'extra_fee' and thus reducing the 'sales'.",
