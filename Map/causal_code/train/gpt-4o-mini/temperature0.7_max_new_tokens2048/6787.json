  "Explanation": "An increase in `total_sales` reflects higher sum totals in `sales_data`, since `total_sales` directly sums these values. Assuming no other factors modify `sales_data` directly in this calculation, observing a higher `total_sales` suggests that the `sales_data` contained larger values.",
