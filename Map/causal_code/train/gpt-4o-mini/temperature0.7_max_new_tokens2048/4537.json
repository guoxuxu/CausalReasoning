  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(tax_rate, base_price, discount_rate, season):\n    if season == 'holiday':\n        discount_rate += 0.05\n    final_price = base_price * (1 - discount_rate)\n    tax_amount = final_price * tax_rate\n    total_price = final_price + tax_amount\n    return total_price\",\n\nIf we intervene to set the discount rate to zero during a non-holiday season, will the final price equal the base price?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the discount rate to zero means that the final price formula becomes base_price * (1 - 0), which simplifies to base_price. Since it is not a holiday season, there is no additional increment to the discount rate, which allows us to directly conclude that final_price equals base_price when discount rate is zero.",
