  "Explanation": "Increasing 'user_growth_rate' leads to more adjusted_users. This could initially suggest a lower 'interaction_rate' since the denominator increases, but the actual change in 'interaction_rate' depends also on the 'interactions' variable, which remains unaffected by 'user_growth_rate' itself. Therefore, a direct causal decrease isn't guaranteed without knowing how 'interactions' changes.",
