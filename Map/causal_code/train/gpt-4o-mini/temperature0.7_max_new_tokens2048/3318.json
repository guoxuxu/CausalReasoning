  "Problem": "def calculate_sales(price, demand, tax_rate):\n    tax = price * demand * tax_rate\n    final_sales = price * demand + tax\n    return final_sales\",\n\nIf the demand increases, will the final_sales increase assuming no intervention on price and tax_rate?",
  "Explanation": "In the original code, final_sales is calculated based on price, demand, and tax, where tax itself is a function of price, demand, and tax_rate. Increasing demand directly increases both the tax and the product of the price and demand, given the price and tax_rate are constant. Hence, the final_sales will increase.",

Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
