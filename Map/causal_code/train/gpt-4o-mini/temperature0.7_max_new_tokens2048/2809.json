  "Explanation": "Low output from the add method after updating the values does not provide conclusive evidence regarding the original product's value, as the original values of a or b might have been such that they provided a high product with different addition results (e.g., higher a, lower b). This illustrates that an intervention adjusted values without offering information on the original state, thus preventing a reliable inference from effect to cause.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "Calling updateValues directly affects the values of a and b, which in turn influences the outputs of the multiply and add methods. If the sum from add is lower, it indicates that either a or b has decreased. This suggests that the product from multiply was originally higher if both a and b were higher before the update.",
