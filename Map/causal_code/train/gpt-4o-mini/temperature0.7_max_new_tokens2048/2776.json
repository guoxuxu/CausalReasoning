  "Explanation": "Given the method set_temperature directly sets the temperature and updates the weather status to 'cold' if the temperature is 20 degrees or less, setting it to 10 degrees will override any previous weather conditions and set the status to 'cold', independent of the humidity or previous status.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature directly influences the weather status, where a temperature above 20 degrees results in a 'sunny' status, while a temperature that is 20 degrees or below results in a 'cold' status. The humidity also affects the weather status, as humidity levels above 70 cause the weather status to change to 'rainy'. Adjusting the humidity changes the humidity level, and setting the temperature directly modifies its value.",
