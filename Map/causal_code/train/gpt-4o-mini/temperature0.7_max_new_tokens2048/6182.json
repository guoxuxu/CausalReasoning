  "Explanation": "Setting academic_performance high and increasing height does not necessarily imply weight will decrease. Although there is a negative coefficient between weight and academic performance, the equation for academic performance includes both positive and negative influences involving height and weight. The effect of increasing height could still offset any potential decrease in weight to maintain high academic performance.",
