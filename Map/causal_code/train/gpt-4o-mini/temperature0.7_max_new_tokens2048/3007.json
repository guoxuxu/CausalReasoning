  "Explanation": "The calculation of `risk_factor` solely relies on the `age` and does not directly depend on the income. Even though the `income` is adjusted in the `clean` function, this does not affect the calculation of the `risk_factor`; hence, observing a high `risk_factor` cannot specifically let us infer the manipulation of `income`.",
