  "Explanation": "Setting the `ac_on` to True actuates the air conditioning system and leads to a reduction in `temperature`. This intervention bypasses the natural control flow where the AC is conditioned by `external_temp` values, proving a direct causal mechanism where actuating the AC impacts the `temperature`.",
