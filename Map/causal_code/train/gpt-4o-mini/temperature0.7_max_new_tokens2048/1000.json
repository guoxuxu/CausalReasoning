  "Explanation": "Changing `bonus_enabled` from False to True activates the conditional code block inside the function, adding the highest grade (bonus) to the `base_score`, thus increasing it.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The variable 'grades' influences 'base_score' by determining its average value. The variable 'bonus_enabled' affects 'base_score' positively by adding the maximum grade when true. The variable 'penalty_enabled' impacts 'base_score' negatively by subtracting the minimum grade when true. Thus, changing 'bonus_enabled' from False to True will increase 'base_score' due to the addition of the maximum grade.",
