  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    scaled_data = data * 10\n    result = scaled_data + 5\n    return result\n\ndata = 3\noutput = process_data(data)\",\n\nIf the value of 'data' is increased, will 'output' also increase, without any other intervention?",
  "Explanation": "The function 'process_data' scales 'data' by multiplying it by 10 and then adds 5 to it to produce 'output'. An increase in 'data' directly leads to an increase in 'scaled_data', which subsequently increases 'result', and hence 'output'.",
