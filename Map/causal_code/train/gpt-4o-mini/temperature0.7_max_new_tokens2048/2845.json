  "Explanation": "A smaller increase in the total after adding an item might suggest it is less expensive or due to other reasons but under a new policy that eliminates the 'onSale' discounts, similar increases would be observed regardless of items' previous 'onSale' status. The observed effect (lesser increase in total) cannot definitively suggest the cause (item was onSale) when intervention (policy change) eradicates the effect of 'onSale'.",
