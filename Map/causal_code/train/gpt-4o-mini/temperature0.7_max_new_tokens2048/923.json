  "Explanation": "No, because 'isHeating' being false can also be a result of 'currentTemperature' being initially set to a value equal or higher than 'setTemperature' prior to the external method call or the method may not have changed the temperature at all (e.g., only checking the temperature). Thus, without additional information regarding what the external method does, we cannot causally infer that it affected the temperature to meet or exceed 'setTemperature'.",
