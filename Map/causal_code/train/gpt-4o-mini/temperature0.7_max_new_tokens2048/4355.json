  "Explanation": "The method 'checkRain' includes a parameter for 'externalRain' which directly sets 'isRaining' to true if it is true, irrespective of the temperature conditions. Thus, even setting a moderate external temperature of 10 degrees does not prevent the rain state change induced by external rain.",
