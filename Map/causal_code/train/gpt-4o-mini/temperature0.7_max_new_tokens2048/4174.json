  "Problem": "def process_data(data, flag):\n    if flag:\n        data = sorted(data)\n    else:\n        data = [d * 2 for d in data]\n    summary = sum(data)\n    return summary\",\n\nIf the 'flag' parameter is set to True, will the 'summary' likely be different?",
  "Explanation": "Setting the 'flag' to True causes the data to be sorted before the sum is calculated. Sorting the data does not change individual values or their sum. Therefore, the output, 'summary', remains unaffected by sorting but is contingent upon whether data is sorted or doubled, thus influencing the path to get to 'summary'.",
