  "Explanation": "An increase in revenue, while holding costs and tax rate constant, increases the profit before tax. Consequently, despite a proportional increase in tax, the net profit ultimately increases because the increase in profit before tax outweighs the increase in tax. The dependency is linear and direct between revenue and net profit.",
