  "Explanation": "A higher totalAmount could be due to an increase in either principal or time, or a combination of these, not necessarily only due to an increase in the rate. The relationship does not exclusively link a higher totalAmount to a higher rate without considering other contributing factors.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
