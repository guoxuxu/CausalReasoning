  "Problem": "def increment(x): return x + 1\ndef double(x): return x * 2\ndef process_data(x): y = increment(x); z = double(y); return z\",\n\nCan a higher output value of `process_data` function imply that the initial input `x` was higher?",
  "Explanation": "A higher output `z` from `process_data` suggests that the output `y` from the `increment` function was also higher, considering the deterministic nature of the `double` function (`z = 2*y`). Since `y` equals `x+1`, a higher `y` implies a higher `x`. Therefore, observing a higher `z` allows us to infer a higher `x`, even though this is a backwards inference with inherent assumptions of no other influences on `x` or internal function modifications.",
