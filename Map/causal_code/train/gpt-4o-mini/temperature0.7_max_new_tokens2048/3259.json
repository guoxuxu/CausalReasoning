  "Explanation": "A change in `healthStatus` could be the result of updating either `hasHealthyDiet`, `exercisesRegularly`, or both. Thus, observing a change in `healthStatus` alone does not specifically imply that `exercisesRegularly` was updated. Information about the diet or other interventions is also required to draw such a conclusion.",
