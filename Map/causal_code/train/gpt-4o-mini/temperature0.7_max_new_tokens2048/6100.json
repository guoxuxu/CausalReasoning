  "Explanation": "Though a turned-on fan indicates that the humidity is likely above the threshold (greater than 73.53 after being adjusted by 1.08), we cannot definitively conclude this without intervention because other factors not included in the code could influence the fan's status (e.g., manual intervention, other automated systems).",
