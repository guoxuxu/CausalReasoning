  "Problem": "def temperature_adjustment(sensor_data): \n  temp = sensor_data['temperature'] \n  humidity = sensor_data['humidity'] \n  if humidity > 50: \n    adjustment = 0.1 * (humidity - 50) \n  else:  \n    adjustment = 0 \n  adjusted_temp = temp - adjustment \n  return adjusted_temp \n \n sensor_data = {'temperature': 80, 'humidity': 60} \n print(temperature_adjustment(sensor_data))\",\n\nIf the humidity increases without other interventions, will the adjusted temperature decrease?",
  "Explanation": "The code decreases the base temperature by a factor proportional to the humidity above 50. Increasing humidity leads to a higher adjustment, thus a lower adjusted temperature.",
