  "Explanation": "While the 'decreaseTemperature' method decreases humidity by 20 units if the temperature falls below 18, humidity can also marginally increase or decrease through changes made by the 'increaseHeat' method based on the heating source, such as 'solar' or 'geothermal'. Therefore, a decrease in humidity alone does not guarantee a fall in temperature below 18 degrees.",
