  "Explanation": "An increase in savings could arise from either a decrease in expenses, an increase in salary, or a decrease in tax rate via a new tax cut. However, it could not be definitively claimed without ruling out the other possible causes.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
