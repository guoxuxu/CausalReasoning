  "Explanation": "Setting 'heater_on' to True does not activate the heater or control temperature directly. The code's logic requires that 'increase_temperature' or 'decrease_temperature' be called, which are only triggered under specific temperature conditions. Manually setting 'heater_on' True won't invoke these methods without the right temperature conditions.",
