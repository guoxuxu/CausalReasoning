  "Explanation": "Setting the promotion status to true will directly impact the pricing, reducing it to 100 (if inventory is not less than 50). This lower price, as per the sales computation logic, increases sales to 300. Hence, intervening to set the promotion status affects sales through the change in pricing.",
