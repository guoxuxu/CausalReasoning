  "Problem": "def update_status(temperature, rainfall):\n    if temperature > 30 and rainfall < 10:\n        status = 'drought'\n    elif temperature < 0 and rainfall > 50:\n        status = 'flood'\n    else:\n        status = 'normal'\n    return status\n\ndef send_alert(status):\n    if status == 'drought':\n        alert_sent = True\n    elif status == 'flood':\n        alert_sent = True\n    else:\n        alert_sent = False\n    return alert_sent\",\n\nIf the temperature is increased above 30 with a low rainfall, would the `status` definitely be 'drought'?",
  "Explanation": "The `update_status` function sets the status to 'drought' when the temperature exceeds 30 and the rainfall is less than 10. An increase in temperature above 30 with low rainfall fits these conditions, leading to the status being 'drought'.",
