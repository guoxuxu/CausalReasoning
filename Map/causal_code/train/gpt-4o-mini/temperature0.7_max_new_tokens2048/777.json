  "Explanation": "When 'status' is set to 'success', it implies that the 'error' key was not found in the data, as delineated in the conditional if-else structure. Therefore, the code flow suggests that if the 'status' is 'success', there was no error. This tests the reasoning from effect to cause without intervention.",
