  "Explanation": "If you can manipulate the random result and observe that 'final_score' is greater than 20, it must mean 'favorite_shown' was True. This deduction assumes an ability to ensure minimal addition by setting the random function to provide only 1; any score above 20 indicates additional increments beyond minimal control, possible only if 'favorite_shown' was set to True.",
