  "Explanation": "In the function, x is directly proportional to input_data (x = input_data * 2), and y depends linearly on x (y = x + 4). Whether y results in z being y * 2 or y - 2, z is still dependent on the value of y, and hence on input_data. An increase in input_data increases x, which increases y, thus increasing z in both conditional outcomes.",
