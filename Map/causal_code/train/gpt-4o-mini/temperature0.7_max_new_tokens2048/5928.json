  "Explanation": "A lower health score does not always imply older age due to the multiple variables influencing the score, like smoking status and fitness level. A younger person who is a smoker and has low fitness could have a similar or lower score compared to an older non-smoker with high fitness.",

  "causal_map_integration": "A person's age directly influences their health score, with older age leading to a lower score. A higher fitness level increases the health score, while a lower fitness level decreases it. Smoking status negatively impacts the health score, reducing it further. Additionally, being older than 50 results in an additional decrease in the health score.",
