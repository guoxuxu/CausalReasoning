  "Explanation": "Revenue decrease can be due to either a decrease in price or quantity or both. Without additional information, it's unclear whether the decrease in revenue is solely due to a decrease in quantity.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in price leads to an increase in revenue, while an increase in quantity also leads to an increase in revenue. A discount applied to the price decreases the price, thereby affecting revenue. The discount also allows for a prediction of revenue after the price has been reduced, based on the adjusted price and quantity.",
