  "Explanation": "Although using a high factor in the 'standardize' method can lead to a larger spread, a large output spread could also result from large variability in the original data itself or other manipulation not specified in 'process_data'. Thus, we cannot definitively infer that only the 'method' and 'factor' were responsible without additional information.",
