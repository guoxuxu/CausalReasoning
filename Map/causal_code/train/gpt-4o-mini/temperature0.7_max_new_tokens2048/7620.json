  "Problem": "def calculate_discount(price, customer_age, is_first_time_customer): \n    if customer_age > 60 or is_first_time_customer: \n        discount = 0.10 \n    else: \n        discount = 0.05 \n    final_price = price * (1 - discount) \n    return final_price\",\n\nIf we observe a decrease in the final price, can we determine if the shop ran a promotion for all elderly customers?",
  "Explanation": "Although a promotion on elderly customers might result in a lower final price for them by increasing their discount, a decrease in the final price could also occur due to lowering the prices or because the product was bought by a first-time customer. Hence, observing a decrease in the final price does not exclusively indicate a promotion for elderly customers.",
