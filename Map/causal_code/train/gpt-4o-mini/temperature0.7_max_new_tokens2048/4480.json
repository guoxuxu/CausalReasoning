  "Problem": "class WeatherForecast {\n  public bool isRainy;\n  public int temperature;\n\n  public WeatherForecast(bool rain, int temp) {\n    isRainy = updateRainStatus(rain);\n    temperature = adjustTemperature(temp, rain);\n  }\n\n  private bool updateRainStatus(bool rain) {\n    return rain && (temperature < 20);\n  }\n\n  private int adjustTemperature(int temp, bool rain) {\n    if (rain) return temp - 5;\n    return temp;\n  }\n}\",\n\nIf isRainy is true, can we conclude that the initial temperature was below 20?",
  "Explanation": "While isRainy being true requires it to be raining and temperature initially read to be below 20, the temperature could have been adjusted in adjustTemperature. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the exact initial temperature just based on isRainy being true without knowing the rain status.",
