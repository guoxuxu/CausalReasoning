  "Problem": "def student_performance(height, study_hours, part_time_job):\n  stress_level = 0.4 * part_time_job\n  rest_quality = -0.3 * stress_level\n  study_efficiency = study_hours * (0.5 + 0.2 * rest_quality)\n  health = 0.6 * height - 0.5 * stress_level\n  performance = 0.3 * health + 0.7 * study_efficiency\n  return performance\n\n# Example invocation\nperformance = student_performance(170, 5, 1)\",\n\nCan a decrease in performance suggest a reduction in health?",
  "Explanation": "Performance is calculated with a component from health. A decrease in performance could be due to a decrease in health, among other factors, following a retro-causal inference from performance (effect) to health (cause) without direct intervention.",
