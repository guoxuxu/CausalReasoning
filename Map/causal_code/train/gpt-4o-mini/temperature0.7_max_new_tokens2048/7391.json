  "Explanation": "Setting humidity to a higher level of 70 impacts the discomfort index due to the positive term `0.01 * humidity * (0.99 * temperature - 14.3)` and crossing the conditional `if temperature > 25 and humidity > 60` means any result will be multiplied by 1.2. Since the original humidity at 65 also satisfies this condition, increase in humidity will increase the discomfort index itself, leading to a higher score even before considering the conditional multiplier.",
