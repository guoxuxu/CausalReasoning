  "Problem": "def market_behavior(company_sales, economic_growth):\n    if economic_growth > 3:\n        company_sales *= 1.1\n    else:\n        company_sales *= 0.9\n    company_sales -= 100  # constant operating costs\n    return company_sales\",\n\nIf company sales see an increase, does it imply that the economic growth was above 3%?",
  "Explanation": "While higher economic growth leads to increased sales, an increase in sales could be influenced by other external factors or initial higher sales before any change due to economic conditions. Therefore, just an increase in sales alone cannot confirm that the economic growth was above 3%.",
