  "Problem": "def process_data(data):\n    data['profit'] = data['revenue'] - data['costs']\n    data['profit_margin'] = (data['profit'] / data['revenue']) * 100\n    if data['city'] == 'New York':\n        data['adjusted_profit'] = data['profit'] - 100\n    else:\n        data['adjusted_profit'] = data['profit']\n    return data\",\n\nAssuming an intervention has maximized 'profit_margin', can it be concluded that 'costs' were minimized?",
  "Explanation": "Maximizing 'profit_margin' requires maximizing the ratio of 'profit' over 'revenue'. One effective way to achieve this under the given code is by minimizing 'costs', which directly increases 'profit', thus maximizing 'profit_margin'.",
