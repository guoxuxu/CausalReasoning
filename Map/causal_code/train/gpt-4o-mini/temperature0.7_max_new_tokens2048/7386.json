  "Explanation": "Observing a high number of infections at the end does not necessarily imply a high rate of infection throughout the simulation. The high number might be due to other factors such as a prolonged period before any intervention, or ineffectiveness of possible interventions like vaccines. The rate influences infection increase but is not the sole factor determining the end count of infected individuals.",
