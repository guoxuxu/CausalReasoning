  "Explanation": "Changing the random seed indeed influences the sequence of random numbers generated, and hence the noise added. However, the noise remains random and unpredictable (though reproducible with the same seed), not forming a consistent pattern in the data outcomes, reflecting an intervention without a predictable effect.",
