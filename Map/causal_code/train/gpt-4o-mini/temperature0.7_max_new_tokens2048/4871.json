  "Explanation": "Increasing `initial_data` increases `processed_data` (as `processed_data` is a linear function of `initial_data` in `process_data`). Without intervention, a higher `processed_data` results in a higher `final_score` through the functions `process_data`, `evaluate_score`, and potentially `add_bonus`.",
