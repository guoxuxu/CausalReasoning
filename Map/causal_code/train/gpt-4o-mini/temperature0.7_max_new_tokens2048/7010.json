  "Problem": "def compute_score(health_index, environment_factor, genetic_factor):\n    base_score = 50\n    adjusted_health_score = base_score + (health_index * 10) - (environment_factor * 5)\n    final_score = adjusted_health_score + (genetic_factor * 15)\n    return final_score\",\n\nIf health_index increases, will final_score increase without any other changes?",
  "Explanation": "In the function, final_score is dependent on adjusted_health_score, which directly incorporates health_index multiplied by 10. An increase in health_index leads to an increase in adjusted_health_score and thus increases final_score. This is a direct causal relationship without intervention.",
