  "Explanation": "With the 'discount' being fixed, any variation in 'final_price' cannot be attributed to changes in the discount. Thus, if the 'final_price' is observed to be higher, it must be because the underlying 'base_price' or 'sales_tax' increased. Given a constant 'sales_tax', an increase in 'final_price' would indeed suggest that 'base_price' has increased.",
