  "Explanation": "A low 'item_per_user' could be due to either a low 'num_items' or a high 'adjusted_users'. Since 'adjusted_users' depends on both 'num_users' and 'user_growth_rate', a low 'item_per_user' does not necessarily imply a low initial 'num_items'; it could also imply high 'num_users', high 'user_growth_rate', or combinations thereof.",
