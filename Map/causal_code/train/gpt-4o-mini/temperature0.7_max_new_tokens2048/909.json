  "Problem": "def compute_metrics(data):\n  sales = sum(data['sales'])\n  expenses = sum(data['expenses'])\n  profit = sales - expenses\n  roi = (profit / expenses) * 100 if expenses != 0 else 0\n  return {'sales': sales, 'expenses': expenses, 'profit': profit, 'roi': roi}\n\ndata = {'sales': [100, 200, 300], 'expenses': [50, 150, 200]}\nmetrics = compute_metrics(data)\",\n\nIf the computed ROI is observed to decrease, could it imply an increase in expenses?",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in ROI (Return on Investment), which is calculated as (profit / expenses) * 100, could happen due to lesser profit or greater expenses. Given no change in sales, an increase in expenses would reduce profit hence decreasing ROI, assuming profit did not change disproportionately. This shows tracing back from an effect (ROI change) to a potential cause (expenses change) without intervention.",
