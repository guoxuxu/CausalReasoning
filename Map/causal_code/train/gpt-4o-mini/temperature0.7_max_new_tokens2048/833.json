  "Explanation": "Although the temperature exceeding 100 results in the reaction rate doubling, the reaction rate might also increase by other operations or external modifications not shown in the provided code. We don't have evidence that other parts of the program or external factors do not affect the reaction rate, hence we cannot definitively conclude the cause solely based on the effect.",
