  "Explanation": "The fan turns on when the adjusted humidity level exceeds 80. Setting the `humid_level` high enough to achieve this adjusted value will indeed turn on the fan. For instance, setting it to at least 74 would result in an adjusted humidity of approximately 80, thereby turning the fan on.",
