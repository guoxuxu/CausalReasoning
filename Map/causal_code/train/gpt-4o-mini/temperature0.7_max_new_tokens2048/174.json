  "Explanation": "The output 'Add Water' indicates insufficient water, which typically suggests 'water_used' exceeded 'water_level'. However, without intervention, other possibilities like machine malfunctioning or wrong data inputs could not be ruled out, so causal inference just based on output is not definitive.",
