  "Explanation": "After intervention through invest_more method, while the adjust_investment() method adjusts the investment based on market trend, the initial increase comes from the manual addition of funds. Thus, the total investment size could increase regardless of whether the market trend is 'bull', and other factors like additional investments directly affect the total.",
