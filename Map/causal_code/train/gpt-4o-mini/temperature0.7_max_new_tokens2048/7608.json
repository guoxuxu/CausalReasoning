  "Explanation": "Doubling of the total_score could result from doubling the bonus_factor, but it could also occur from changes in the data, such as more records being scored or existing scores increasing due to changes in type distribution ('B' to 'A'). Hence, we cannot definitively conclude the change in bonus_factor without further information.",
