  "Explanation": "Cloudiness (isCloudy = true) indicates that the last state of temperature was below zero or was cloudy from the start. Simply raising the temperature does not instantly make it clear, as the state of cloudiness would only potentially change during the next updateWeather call where conditions are re-evaluated.",
