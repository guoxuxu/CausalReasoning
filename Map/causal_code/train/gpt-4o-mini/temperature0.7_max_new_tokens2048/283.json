  "Problem": "Above Python code\",\n\nIf we intervene to set the heating system to increase output regardless of occupant count or external temperatures, will the internal temperature increase?",
  "Explanation": "Directly manipulating the heating system to increase its output will elevate the internal temperature, independent of other variables such as occupancy or external temperature. This intervention directly targets the primary cause of internal temperature change, i.e., the heating output.",
  "causal_map_prompt": "\nYou are an expert in causal reasoning. Given the following problem description and question, identify all relevant variables and describe their direct causal relationships.Your output should be a clear causal map in textual form, listing directed causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B).Avoid redundancy or duplicate links. List only distinct and meaningful causal relations. Do not provide any final answer to the question. Focus only on extracting the causal structure.

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
