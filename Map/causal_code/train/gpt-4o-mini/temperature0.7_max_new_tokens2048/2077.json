  "Explanation": "While changes in 'DiscountedTotal' might be influenced by 'IsLoyaltyMember' status due to the discount application, it is not causative backward; you cannot reliably predict loyalty membership based purely on the 'DiscountedTotal' value, especially since other factors like 'Total' size also influence it.",
