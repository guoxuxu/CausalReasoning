  "Explanation": "From cause to effect with intervention: By setting the penalty to 0, the adjusted_score increases (since penalty is subtracted in the computation). Assuming all other parameters (base_score, has_bonus, score_multiplier) remain constant, this intervention (reducing the penalty) directly causes an increase in the final_score.",
