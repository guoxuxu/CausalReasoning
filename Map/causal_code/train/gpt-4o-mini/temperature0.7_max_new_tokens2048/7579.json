  "Problem": "def compute_values(temp, pressure):\n    boiling_point = 100 + (pressure - 1) * 0.5\n    if temp > boiling_point:\n        state = 'Gas'\n    elif temp == boiling_point:\n        state = 'Transition'\n    else:\n        state = 'Liquid'\n    return state\",\n\nIf we adjust the pressure to 1 atmosphere and the temperature remains the same, will this ensure the state is 'Liquid'?",
  "Explanation": "Changing the pressure to 1 atmospheres sets the boiling point to 100 degrees Celsius. Whether the state is 'Liquid' still depends on whether the original temperature was less than 100. If the temperature was 100 or higher, adjusting the pressure alone would not make the state 'Liquid'.",
