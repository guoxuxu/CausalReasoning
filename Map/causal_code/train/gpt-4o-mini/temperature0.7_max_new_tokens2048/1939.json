  "Explanation": "Intervening by adding a filter that skips over negative values ensures that any negative shipment entries, which would reduce stock numbers, do not impact the quantity of 'oranges' in the stock, preserving or increasing the count.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
