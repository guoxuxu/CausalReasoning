  "Problem": "def analyze_sales(data):\n  discounts = data['discount'] > 20\n  weekend = data['day'].isin(['Saturday', 'Sunday'])\n  high_sales = data['sales'] > 500\n  if discounts and weekend:\n    increase = 0.15 * data['sales']\n  else:\n    increase = 0.05 * data['sales']\n  data['forecast_sales'] = data['sales'] + increase\n  return data\",\n\nIf we programmatically set all days to be weekends, will this lead to an increase in all forecast_sales calculations?",
  "Explanation": "Changing all days to weekends manipulates the 'weekend' variable to always be true, which, when combined with any present discounts over 20%, will result in utilizing the higher 15% increase formula, thus raising the forecast_sales across the board.",
