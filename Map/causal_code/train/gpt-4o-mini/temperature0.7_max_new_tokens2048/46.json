  "Explanation": "The interest calculation in the `calculate_interest` function is dependent only on the `balance` and the `rate`. A decrease in interest could be due to a decrease in the rate or an untouched balance. The balance is not influenced by the change in interest outright without other external adjustments; it does not automatically decrease when interest does.",
