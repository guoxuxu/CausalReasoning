  "Explanation": "The output weights displayed by the deploy_model function are directly derived from the model trained in train_model, which in turn depends on the input from preprocess_data. However, an unexpected weight output from deploy_model primarily indicates a potential issue or anomaly in the train_model's weight setting or calculation logic, not necessarily a flaw in the preprocessing of data, as preprocessing here only filters None values without modifying data values used to set the weights.",
