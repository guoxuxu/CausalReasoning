  "Explanation": "Although increasing 'b' will increase 'y' (since y = b + 5) and hence increase 'z' and 'w', the return value 'w' can also be increased by manipulating 'a'. Therefore, an increase in 'w' does not distinctly imply an increase in 'b' since the increase could as well derive from 'a'.",
