  "Explanation": "A higher 'average' in the results could stem from a variety of input configurations: having exclusively larger numbers, a mix of high and moderate values, or even fewer but larger positive numbers compared to a previous dataset. Without additional specifics about the distribution and count of the input values, one cannot assert that larger numbers exclusively led to a higher 'average.'",
