  "Problem": "TrafficControlSystem class definition with methods to manage traffic based on car and pedestrian densities.\",\n\nIf the traffic light is Green, can we infer the car traffic density is between 11 and 50?",
  "Explanation": "The only condition under which the traffic_light is set to 'Green' is when the car_traffic_density is between 11 and 50 inclusive.",
