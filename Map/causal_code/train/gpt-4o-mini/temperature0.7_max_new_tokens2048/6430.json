  "Explanation": "Improvements in 'teamB' scores could be due to several factors such as an enhancement in bonus for 'teamA' reducing the relative competition, an error in score recording, or changes in the initial scores. Without controlling for these variables, a causal conclusion that penalty was reduced cannot be drawn confidently.",
