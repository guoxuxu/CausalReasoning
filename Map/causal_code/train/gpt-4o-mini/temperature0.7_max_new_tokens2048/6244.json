  "Explanation": "When the heater is on, it implies that the system had a positive temperature difference (desired_temp > current_temp). Since the system turns on the heater only under this condition, observing the heater on allows us to infer backwards to the state of the temperatures. This is a reasoning from effect to cause without any intervention.",
