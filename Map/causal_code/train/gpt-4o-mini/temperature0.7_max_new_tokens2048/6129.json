  "Problem": "def compute_interest(balance, rate):\n  interest = balance * rate\n  return interest\n\nbalance = 1000\ndiscount_rate = 0.05\nif balance > 500:\n  adjusted_rate = discount_rate - 0.01\nelse:\n  adjusted_rate = discount_rate\nfinal_interest = compute_interest(balance, adjusted_rate)\",\n\nIf we modify the discount_rate to always subtract 0.01, regardless of the balance amount, will this lead to a consistent reduction in final_interest for all balances?",
  "Explanation": "Applying a consistent reduction of 0.01 to the discount_rate, irrespective of the balance, will reduce the adjusted_rate, thereby reducing the computed final interest uniformly across all balances using the interest calculation formula.",

Given the following problem description and question, and optionally a list of causal links, If no causal links are provided, first identify all relevant variables and their direct causal links as \"A → B\" (meaning A directly causes B). Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
