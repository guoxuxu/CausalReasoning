  "Explanation": "A lower inventory could be due to either increased sales or decreased production, or both. It cannot be conclusively determined that sales exceeded production without further information about the production level.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
