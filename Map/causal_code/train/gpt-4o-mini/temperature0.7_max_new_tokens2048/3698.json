  "Problem": "{\n    \"description\": \"A simple inventory system that manages orders and stock for items. When an order is made for an item, the stock quantity decreases. If the stock goes below a minimum threshold, a restock action is triggered automatically.\",\n    \"code\": \"class InventorySystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.stock = {'apple': 50, 'banana': 30}\n        self.min_threshold = {'apple': 10, 'banana': 5}\n\n    def order_item(self, item_name, quantity):\n        if item_name in self.stock:\n            self.stock[item_name] -= quantity\n            if self.stock[item_name] < self.min_threshold[item_name]:\n                self.restock_item(item_name)\n\n    def restock_item(self, item_name):\n        self.stock[item_name] += 100\n\"\n  },\n\nIf a customer orders 45 apples, will this trigger a restock?",
  "Explanation": "Ordering 45 apples decreases the stock from 50 to 5, which is below the minimum threshold (10). According the code, this automatically triggers restocking.",
