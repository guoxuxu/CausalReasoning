  "Explanation": "A 'mild' weather status is determined purely by the specific range of temperatures (between 10 and 30). While humidity could influence these conditions, it is not necessary for an intervention in humidity to have occurred for a 'mild' result, as this can also be due to a standard weather condition without intervention.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature influences the current temperature, and the humidity level directly affects the humidity. A heat wave increases the temperature, while rain increases humidity and can decrease temperature if a certain amount is exceeded. Adjusting humidity can also increase humidity and potentially decrease temperature if the humidity exceeds a threshold. Finally, the temperature affects the weather report.",
