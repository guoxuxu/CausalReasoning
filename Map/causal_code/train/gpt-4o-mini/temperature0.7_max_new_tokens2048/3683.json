  "Explanation": "A change in 'processed_value' implies that there was a change in 'value', as 'processed_value' is computed solely as a function of 'value'. Since 'processed_value' equals 5 times the square of 'value', any alteration in 'processed_value' suggests 'value' was altered, assuming the function itself remains unchanged.",

Examine the causal links to ensure logical consistency: remove duplicate, redundant, or self-referential relations (e.g., both 'A → B' and 'B → A', or 'A → A').Then, synthesize these causal links into concise, natural-language statements, summarizing how one variable causally influence another.Use as few sentences as needed to maintain clarity.
