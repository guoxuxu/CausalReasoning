  "Explanation": "Even with the control of pressure, the heating of the system through the 'heat_system' method can result in a temperature rise above 30 degrees Celsius, which triggers an increase in humidity. The control of pressure does not directly prevent the humidity from increasing as a result of the temperature surpassing 30 degrees.",
