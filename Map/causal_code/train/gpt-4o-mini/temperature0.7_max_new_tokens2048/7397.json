  "Explanation": "A positive temp_change does not guarantee that rain will not occur, because the rain state is ultimately set based on new_rain_condition, regardless of the temperature update. Moreover, the impact of the temperature passing certain thresholds (60 or 80) could also have modified the rain condition beforehand.",
