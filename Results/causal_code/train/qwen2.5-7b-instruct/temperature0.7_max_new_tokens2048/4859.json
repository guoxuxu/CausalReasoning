    "Let's break down the logic of the `prescribe_medication` function to determine if the prescription will be 'Beta Blocker' when the age is over 50 and the heart rate is originally higher than 100.\n\n1. The function checks if the age is greater than 50.\n2. If it is, it then checks if the heart rate is greater than 100.\n3. If both conditions are met (age > 50 and heart_rate > 100), it returns 'Beta Blocker'.\n4. If only the age condition is met (age > 50) but the heart rate is not greater than 100, it returns 'ACE Inhibitor'.\n5. Other conditions are checked for different medications.\n\nGiven the conditions in the question:\n- Age is 55 (which is over 50).\n- Original heart rate is 105 (which is greater than 100).\n\nAccording to the function logic, if both conditions (age > 50 and heart_rate > 100) are met, the function should return 'Beta Blocker'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `prescribe_medication` takes two parameters: `age` and `heart_rate`.\n\n2. The conditions in the function are checked in order:\n   - If `age > 50` and `heart_rate > 100`, it returns 'Beta Blocker'.\n   - If only `age > 50`, it returns 'ACE Inhibitor'.\n   - If `age <= 50` and a random choice of True or False is made, it returns 'Aspirin'.\n   - Otherwise, it returns 'No Medication'.\n\n3. Given that `age = 55` (which is greater than 50) and `heart_rate = 105` (which is greater than 100), we check the first condition.\n\n4. Since both conditions (`age > 50` and `heart_rate > 100`) are met, the function will return 'Beta Blocker'.\n\nTherefore, if the age is over 50 and the heart_rate is originally higher than 100, the standard prescription will indeed be 'Beta Blocker'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
