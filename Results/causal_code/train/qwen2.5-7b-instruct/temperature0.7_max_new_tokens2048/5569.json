    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `AlarmSystem` class has an `__init__` method that initializes two attributes:\n   - `window_open`: A boolean indicating whether the window is open.\n   - `motion_detected`: A boolean indicating whether motion is detected.\n\n2. The `trigger_alarm` method checks these conditions:\n   - If both `window_open` and `motion_detected` are True, it returns \"Alarm triggered due to open window and motion!\"\n   - If only `window_open` is True, it returns \"Alarm triggered due to open window!\"\n   - If only `motion_detected` is True, it returns \"Alarm triggered due to motion!\"\n   - If neither condition is met, it returns \"Alarm not triggered.\"\n\n3. The question specifies that the window remains closed and motion is detected. This means:\n   - `window_open` is False (the window is closed).\n   - `motion_detected` is True (motion is detected).\n\n4. According to the logic in the `trigger_alarm` method, when `window_open` is False and `motion_detected` is True, the method should return \"Alarm triggered due to motion!\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"} because under the given conditions, the alarm would indeed be triggered.",
