    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - `product_a` is an instance of `Product` with a price of 100 and `on_sale` set to `True`.\n   - The discount rate for `product_a` is 0.1 because it is on sale.\n   - `product_a.apply_discount()` is called, which applies the discount to the price. The new price after discount is \\(100 \\times (1 - 0.1) = 100 \\times 0.9 = 90\\).\n\n2. **Customer Information**:\n   - `customer` is an instance of `Customer` with an initial budget of 90.\n\n3. **Can Purchase Check**:\n   - Initially, `customer.can_purchase(product_a)` returns `True` because the customer's budget (90) is equal to the discounted price of the product (90).\n\n4. **Increasing Customer Budget**:\n   - If we increase the customer's budget by 20 units, the new budget becomes \\(90 + 20 = 110\\).\n\n5. **Re-evaluate Can Purchase**:\n   - With the new budget of 110, we check if the customer can purchase the product again using `customer.can_purchase(product_a)`.\n   - Since the product's price is now 90, and the customer's budget is 110, the condition `self.budget >= product.price` evaluates to `True`.\n\nTherefore, increasing the customer's budget by 20 units will indeed enable them to purchase the product.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
