  "Question Type": "from effect to cause with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "After a code modification that ignores the 'error' key when defining the status, the presence of the 'error' key would not affect the status. The status could be 'success' regardless of the 'error' key's presence. Therefore, a status of 'success' does not allow us to infer with certainty that there was no 'error' key originally in the input.",
  "causal_map": "error in data → status set to failed; error not in data → status set to success",
  "causal_map_integration": "The presence of 'error' in the input data leads to 'status' being set to 'failed', while the absence of 'error' results in 'status' being set to 'success'.",
