    "Let's break down the `refuel` method:\n\n1. The method takes an argument `fuel`, which represents the amount of fuel to add.\n2. It adds this amount to the current `fuel_level`.\n3. There is a conditional check to ensure that the `fuel_level` does not exceed 100.\n\nGiven this logic, let's consider what happens when `refuel` is called with a value greater than the remaining capacity (i.e., more than 100 - current `fuel_level`):\n\n- If the added fuel exceeds the remaining capacity, the `if` condition will trigger.\n- This ensures that the `fuel_level` is capped at 100, even if more fuel is attempted to be added.\n\nTherefore, if `refuel` is called with a fuel value that would cause the `fuel_level` to exceed 100, the `fuel_level` will indeed be set to 100.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `refuel` method:\n\n1. The `refuel` method takes an argument `fuel`.\n2. It adds this `fuel` to the current `fuel_level`.\n3. If the resulting `fuel_level` exceeds 100, it sets `fuel_level` to 100.\n\nGiven this logic, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If you call `refuel` with a value that, when added to the current `fuel_level`, would exceed 100, the method will cap the `fuel_level` at 100.\n- For example, if the current `fuel_level` is 80 and you call `refuel(30)`, the new `fuel_level` would be 110, which is capped at 100.\n- Similarly, if the current `fuel_level` is 70 and you call `refuel(40)`, the new `fuel_level` would also be 110 but capped at 100.\n\nTherefore, regardless of how much fuel is provided (as long as it's a positive number), the `fuel_level` will never exceed 100 due to the conditional check in the `refuel` method.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze the `refuel` method step by step:\n\n1. The `refuel` method takes an argument `fuel`, which represents the amount of fuel to add to the vehicle.\n2. The current fuel level (`self.fuel_level`) is incremented by the `fuel` value.\n3. There is a conditional check: `if self.fuel_level > 100:`. If this condition is true, it means the fuel level exceeds the maximum capacity (100).\n4. In such a case, the line `self.fuel_level = 100` ensures that the fuel level is capped at 100.\n\nGiven this logic, if you call the `refuel` method with an amount of fuel that would make the `fuel_level` exceed 100, the `fuel_level` will indeed be set to 100 as a result of the conditional check.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `Vehicle` class has an attribute `fuel_level` which starts at 100 by default.\n2. The `refuel` method takes a parameter `fuel`, which represents the amount of fuel to add to the vehicle.\n3. Inside the `refuel` method, the `fuel_level` is incremented by the value of `fuel`.\n4. There's a conditional check: if the new `fuel_level` exceeds 100, it is capped at 100.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we call `refuel` with a value greater than 100:\n\n- If `fuel` is, for example, 150, then:\n  - `fuel_level` becomes 150 + 100 (initial level) = 250\n  - Since 250 > 100, the `fuel_level` is then set to 100.\n\nThis confirms that if `refuel` is called with a value greater than the current capacity (which is 100), the `fuel_level` will indeed be set to 100.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
