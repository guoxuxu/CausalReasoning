    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a `ProductDatabase` class that manages a list of `Product` objects.\n2. The `addProduct` method adds a `Product` to the list.\n3. The `searchProductByName` method iterates over the list of products and checks if any product's name matches the given name.\n4. If a match is found, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we add a product named 'Gadget':\n\n1. We call `addProduct(Product product)` with a `Product` object that has the name 'Gadget'.\n2. This `Product` object is added to the `products` list.\n\nNext, let's see what happens when we search for 'Gadget':\n\n1. We call `searchProductByName('Gadget')`.\n2. The method iterates over the `products` list.\n3. It finds the `Product` with the name 'Gadget' and returns `true`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the product named 'Gadget' will indeed be found by the `searchProductByName('Gadget')` method.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ProductDatabase` class has a method `addProduct(Product product)` which allows adding a product to the internal list of products.\n\n2.

If we add a product named 'Gadget' using the `addProduct()` method, it will be added to the `products` list.\n\n4. The `searchProductByName('Gadget')` method iterates over the `products` list and checks if any product's name matches 'Gadget'.\n\n5. Since we have just added a product with the name 'Gadget', and the search method looks for an exact match, it will find the product.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If a product with the name 'Gadget' is added using the `addProduct` method, the next time we call `searchProductByName('Gadget')`, it will find this product because:\n   - The list of products contains at least one item with the name 'Gadget'.\n   - The `searchProductByName` method will loop through the list and find the matching product.\n\n4. Since the method returns `true` as soon as it finds a match, it will correctly identify that there is a product named 'Gadget'.\n\nTherefore, if a product named 'Gadget' is added, it will indeed be found by the `searchProductByName('Gadget')` method.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the steps to reason through this problem:\n\n1. **Adding a Product**: The `addProduct` method adds a `Product` object to the `products` list. If we call `addProduct(Gadget)`, a new `Product` instance with the name 'Gadget' is added to the list.\n\n2. **Searching for a Product**: The `searchProductByName` method iterates over the `products` list and checks if any of the products have the specified name. If it finds a match, it returns `true`.\n\n3. **Removing a Product**: The `removeProductByName` method removes products from the list based on their name, but it is not relevant to the question since no removal operation is performed.\n\n4. **Applying a Discount**: The `applyDiscount` method changes the price of products in a specific category, but again, it does not affect the search operation.\n\nGiven these points, let's follow the sequence as described:\n\n- We call `addProduct(Gadget)`, which adds a product with the name 'Gadget' to the `products` list.\n- Then we call `searchProductByName('Gadget')`, which will iterate over the `products` list and find the product with the name 'Gadget'.\n- Since a product with the name 'Gadget' exists in the list, the method will return `true`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Adding a Product**: The `addProduct` method is called with a product named 'Gadget'.

This method iterates through the `products` list and checks if any product has the name 'Gadget'.\n\n3. **Checking the Logic**:\n   - Since we have just added a product with the name 'Gadget' to the list, there will be at least one product in the list with the name 'Gadget'.\n   - The `searchProductByName` method will find this product because it matches the name provided ('Gadget').\n\nGiven these steps, the `searchProductByName('Gadget')` method will indeed return `true`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
