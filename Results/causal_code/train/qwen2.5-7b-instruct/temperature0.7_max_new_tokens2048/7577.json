    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_values` calculates the boiling point based on the input pressure.\n\n2. The boiling point formula is: \n   boiling_point = 100 + (pressure - 1) * 0.5\n\n3. If the temperature (`temp`) is increased while keeping everything else constant, we need to consider how this affects the comparison with the boiling point.\n\n4. For any given pressure, there is a specific boiling point calculated using the formula above.\n\n5. If the new temperature is exactly equal to the boiling point, the state will be 'Transition', not 'Gas'.\n\n6. If the new temperature is less than the boiling point, the state will be 'Liquid', not 'Gas'.\n\n7. Therefore, increasing the temperature alone does not guarantee that the state will always be 'Gas'. It depends on the exact value of the new temperature relative to the recalculated boiling point.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

For the state to be 'Gas', we must have `temp > boiling_point`.\n\n6. As the temperature increases, the boiling point also increases linearly according to the formula provided. However, for any given increase in temperature, there is a corresponding increase in boiling point that keeps the temperature below it.\n\n7. Therefore, simply increasing the temperature does not guarantee that it will always exceed the boiling point; it depends on the initial pressure and how much the temperature is increased.\n\n8. There could be scenarios where the temperature increase is not enough to surpass the new boiling point for the given pressure.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the state will not always be 'Gas' when the temperature is increased, as it depends on the specific values of the initial temperature and pressure.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**:\n   - The function `compute_values` takes two parameters: `temp` (temperature) and `pressure`.\n   - It calculates the `boiling_point` using the formula: `boiling_point = 100 + (pressure - 1) * 0.5`.\n\n2. **Conditions for State Determination**:\n   - If `temp > boiling_point`, the state is 'Gas'.\n   - If `temp == boiling_point`, the state is 'Transition'.\n   - If `temp < boiling_point`, the state is 'Liquid'.\n\n3. **Effect of Increasing Temperature**:\n   - When the temperature (`temp`) is increased, it will shift to the right on the number line.\n   - The `boiling_point` also increases with `pressure`, but since `pressure` is held constant, only `temp` changes.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Conditions**:\n   - Initially, if `temp <= boiling_point`, increasing `temp` will eventually make `temp > boiling_point`, changing the state from 'Liquid' or 'Transition' to 'Gas'.\n   - However, if `temp` is already greater than `boiling_point`, increasing `temp` further will not change the state because `temp` is still greater than `boiling_point`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The state will not always be 'Gas' when the temperature is increased. It depends on the initial values of `temp` and `boiling_point`. If `temp` was already above the `boiling_point` initially, increasing it further will not change the state to 'Gas'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

The question asks if the state will always be 'Gas' when the temperature is increased. This is not entirely accurate because:\n   - Initially, as the temperature increases, the state will transition from 'Liquid' to 'Gas'.\n   - After reaching the 'Gas' state, it will stay there as long as the temperature remains above the boiling point.\n\nTherefore, the state will not always be 'Gas' when the temperature is increased; it will only be 'Gas' after the temperature has surpassed the boiling point.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"

However, as `temp` increases, it may not necessarily be greater than `boiling_point` for all values of `pressure`.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n\n- Suppose the initial pressure is 1 atmosphere (where `boiling_point` would be 100°C).\n- If we increase `temp` to 105°C, it will be greater than 100°C, so the state would be 'Gas'.\n- But if we increase the pressure, the `boiling_point` will also increase.\n- For instance, if the pressure is increased to 2 atmospheres, the new `boiling_point` would be 101°C.\n- In this case, even though `temp` is 105°C, which is still greater than 101°C, the state would still be 'Gas'.\n\nHowever, the key point here is that increasing `temp` alone does not guarantee that the state will always be 'Gas'.
