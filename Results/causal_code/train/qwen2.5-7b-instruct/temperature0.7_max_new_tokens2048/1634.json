    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `control_system` function takes two parameters: `temperature_reading` (current temperature) and `set_point` (desired temperature).\n\n2. It calls the `adjust_temperature` function to determine the action needed and the necessary adjustment.\n\n3. The `adjust_temperature` function compares the `current_temperature` with the `desired_temperature` (set_point):\n   - If `current_temperature` is less than `desired_temperature`, it returns 'increase' and the difference.\n   - If `current_temperature` is greater than `desired_temperature`, it returns 'decrease' and the difference.\n   - If they are equal, it returns 'maintain' and 0.\n\n4. Based on the action returned by `adjust_temperature`, the `control_system` function calls either `heating_system`, `cooling_system`, or `maintain_temperature`.\n\n5. The `heating_system` function is called when the action is 'increase', meaning the current temperature is lower than the set point.\n\n6. The `cooling_system` function is called when the action is 'decrease', meaning the current temperature is higher than the set point.\n\n7. If the system reports it is cooling, this means the `cooling_system` function is being called.\n\n8. For the `cooling_system` to be called, the `adjust_temperature` function must have determined that the action needed is 'decrease'.\n\n9. A 'decrease' action indicates that the current temperature is higher than the set point.\n\nTherefore, if the system reports it is cooling, we can conclude that the original set point was indeed lower than the current temperature.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `control_system` function takes two inputs: `temperature_reading` (current temperature) and `set_point` (desired temperature).\n\n2. It calls the `adjust_temperature` function to determine the necessary action ('increase', 'decrease', or 'maintain') and the required adjustment.\n\n3. If the `adjust_temperature` function returns 'increase', the `heating_system` function is called with the adjustment value.\n4. If the `adjust_temperature` function returns 'decrease', the `cooling_system` function is called with the adjustment value.\n5. If the `adjust_temperature` function returns 'maintain', the `maintain_temperature` function is called.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the system reports it is cooling:\n\n- For the system to be cooling, the `cooling_system` function must have been called.\n- This means the `adjust_temperature` function returned 'decrease'.\n- In the `adjust_temperature` function, returning 'decrease' happens when `current_temperature > desired_temperature`.\n\nTherefore, if the system reports it is cooling, we can conclude that the original set point (`desired_temperature`) was indeed lower than the current temperature.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

For the system to report \"Cooling by X degrees\", the `action` returned from `adjust_temperature` must be 'decrease'.\n\n8.
