    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Methods**:\n   - `update_concentration`: This method presumably updates the concentration of a pollutant (e.g., CO).\n   - `calculate_pollution_index`: This method calculates an index based on various concentrations of pollutants.\n\n2. **Effect of `update_concentration`**:\n   - If `update_concentration` is called multiple times with high values for 'CO', it will incrementally increase the concentration of CO.\n\n3. **Impact on `calculate_pollution_index`**:\n   - The `calculate_pollution_index` method likely takes into account the concentration of various pollutants to determine the pollution index.\n   - If the concentration of CO is increased due to repeated calls to `update_concentration`, then the overall pollution index, which depends on these concentrations, is likely to be higher.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since increasing the concentration of CO will contribute to a higher pollution index, if `update_concentration` is called multiple times with high values for 'CO', the `calculate_pollution_index` method will indeed result in a higher output.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
