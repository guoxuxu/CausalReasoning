If each element is scaled by `c`, the mean is also scaled by `c`.\n\n4. **Variance Calculation**:\n   - Variance is calculated as the average of squared differences from the mean.\n   - Since scaling by a fixed constant scales both the elements and the mean by the same factor, the differences between elements and the mean remain the same in terms of relative magnitude.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The variance, which measures the spread of the data, is unaffected by scaling by a fixed constant because the relative differences between the elements and the mean remain unchanged.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

This is because the mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values, and scaling each value by `c` scales the sum by `c`.\n   - New mean = `(sum(x / c) / n)` = `(1/c * sum(x) / n)` = `mean / c`, where `n` is the number of elements.\n\n3. **Effect on Variance**:\n   - Variance is calculated as `sum((x - mean)^2) / (n - 1)`.\n   - If we scale all values by a constant `c`, the new values become `x' = x / c`. \n   - The new mean becomes `mean' = mean / c`.\n   - The new variance calculation would be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Variance} = \\frac{\\sum((x'/c - \\text{mean}/c)^2)}{n-1}\n     \\]\n     Simplifying inside the summation:\n     \\[\n     (x'/c - \\text{mean}/c)^2 = \\left(\\frac{x}{c} - \\frac{\\text{mean}}{c}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{x - \\text{mean}}{c}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(x - \\text{mean})^2}{c^2}\n     \\]\n     Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Variance} = \\frac{\\sum \\frac{(x - \\text{mean})^2}{c^2}}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum (x - \\text{mean})^2}{n-1} = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\cdot \\text{Original Variance}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Changing the normalization from dividing by the maximum value to dividing by a fixed constant will indeed affect the variance.
