    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficSystem` class has an attribute `trafficFlow` which represents the current state of traffic.\n2. There is a method `updateTrafficLight()` that modifies `trafficFlow` based on the weather conditions.\n3. In the `updateTrafficLight()` method:\n   - If `rainy` is true (i.e., it is raining), `trafficFlow` decreases by 20.\n   - If `rainy` is false (i.e., it is not raining), `trafficFlow` increases by 15.\n4. The `setWeather()` method allows setting the weather condition to either rainy or not rainy.\n5. The question asks specifically what happens when it starts raining.\n\nWhen it starts raining:\n- The `rainy` variable will be set to true using the `setWeather(true)` method.\n- As a result, the `updateTrafficLight()` method will be called.\n- Inside `updateTrafficLight()`, since `rainy` is true, the code block `trafficFlow -= 20;` will execute.\n- This means `trafficFlow` will decrease by 20.\n\nTherefore, if it starts raining, the traffic flow would indeed decrease.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
