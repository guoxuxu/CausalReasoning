    "Let's break down the logic of the function `process_sales_data` step by step:\n\n1. **Discount Rate Calculation**:\n   - If `discount_policy` is 'holiday', the initial `discount_rate` is set to 0.2.\n   - Otherwise, it is set to 0.\n\n2. **Total Sales Calculation**:\n   - The total sales amount is calculated as the sum of all `daily_sales`.\n\n3. **Additional Discount Check**:\n   - If the `total_sales` exceeds 1000, an additional 5% discount is applied to the `discount_rate`.

Since the discount rate is non-zero when `discount_policy` is 'holiday', the `discount_amount` will be subtracted from `total_sales + tax_amount`, leading to a lower `final_amount`.\n\nTherefore, the `final_amount` will indeed decrease for the same `daily_sales` and `tax_rate` when the `discount_policy` is set to 'holiday'.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
