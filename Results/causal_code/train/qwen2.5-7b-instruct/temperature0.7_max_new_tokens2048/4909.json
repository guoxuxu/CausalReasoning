    "Let's break down the scenario step by step to determine if the population calculated by `simulateYear()` will be higher with the intervention compared to without it.\n\n### Initial Conditions:\n- **Initial Population**: 100\n- **Growth Rate**: 10% (or 0.10)\n\n### First Year Simulation Without Intervention:\n1.
