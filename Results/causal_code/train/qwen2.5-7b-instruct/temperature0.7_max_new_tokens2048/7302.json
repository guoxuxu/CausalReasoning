  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The code specifies that if 'vehicle_type' is 'electric', then 'emissions' are set to zero. This is direct causality from 'vehicle_type' to 'emissions'. No other vehicle type or input condition in the code results in zero emissions, implying that observing zero emissions guarantees the vehicle was electric.",
  "causal_map": "vehicle_type → emissions; electric → emissions=0; non-electric → emissions=miles_driven * (1/fuel_efficiency) * 20",
  "causal_map_integration": "The vehicle type directly determines whether emissions are zero. If the vehicle type is electric, then emissions are zero. If the vehicle type is not electric, emissions are calculated based on miles driven and fuel efficiency.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_co2_emissions` takes three parameters:\n   - `vehicle_type`\n   - `miles_driven`\n   - `fuel_efficiency`\n\n2. The function checks if `vehicle_type` is equal to 'electric':\n   - If true, it sets `emissions` to 0.\n   - If false, it calculates emissions using the formula: \n     `emissions = miles_driven * (1 / fuel_efficiency) * 20`\n\n3. We are asked if the vehicle type was 'electric' when 'emissions' were observed to be zero.\n\n4. Looking at the logic of the function:\n   - If the vehicle type is 'electric', `emissions` is explicitly set to 0.\n   - If the vehicle type is not 'electric', the formula will always result in a positive number for `emissions`, as long as `miles_driven` and `fuel_efficiency` are valid inputs.\n\n5.
