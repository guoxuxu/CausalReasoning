    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Initially, the students list contains two active students with scores of 85 and 90.\n2. The initial average score is calculated as (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5.\n\n3. When `update_score(students, 1, 95)` is called:\n   - Student with id 1 (initially having a score of 85) is updated to have a score of 95.\n   - This increases the total score from 175 to 180 (since 95 + 90 = 185).\n\n4. After updating, the average score becomes 180 / 2 = 90.\n\n5. When `deactivate_student(students, 1)` is called:\n   - Student with id 1 (now having a score of 95) is deactivated.\n   - Only one student remains active with a score of 90.\n\n6. The average score after deactivating the student is 90 / 1 = 90.\n\nFrom these steps, we can see that:\n- The first update (from 85 to 95) increased the average score from 87.5 to 90.\n- The subsequent deactivation did not change the average score since only one active student remained.\n\nTherefore, the sharp increase in the average score (from 87.5 to 90) was indeed caused by making an inactive student with a high score active.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Initially, the students list contains:\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=85, active=True\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n2. The initial average score is calculated as (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5.\n\n3. `update_score(students, 1, 95)` changes Student 1's score to 95 while keeping them active. The new average is now (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5.\n\n4. `deactivate_student(students, 1)` makes Student 1 inactive. The active student is now only Student 2 with a score of 90.\n\n5. The final average score is (90) / 1 = 90.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question:\n- We observe that the average score increased from 87.5 to 92.5 and then decreased to 90.\n- The sharp increase happened when Student 1's score was updated to 95.\n- However, this increase was not due to making an inactive student with a high score active, because Student 1 was never inactive during this process.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

We then call `update_score(students, 1, 95)`, which changes the score of student 1 to 95 while keeping them active.\n4. The new average score after updating student 1's score is (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5.\n   - This increase is due to the higher score of 95 replacing the previous score of 85.\n\n5. Next, we call `deactivate_student(students, 1)`, which makes student 1 inactive but does not change their score.\n6. The new average score after deactivating student 1 is (90) / 1 = 90.\n   - This decrease is because the average is now based on only one active student.\n\nThe sharp increase in the average score from 87.5 to 92.5 happened when student 1's score was updated to 95, and this increase was due to the higher score replacing the lower score of 85, not because the student was made active again (since they were already active).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Initially, the students list contains:\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=85, active=True\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n2. The initial average score is calculated as (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5.\n\n3. `update_score` is called with student_id=1 and new_score=95. This updates student 1's score to 95 but does not affect the 'active' status. The list now looks like:\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=95, active=True\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n4. Recalculating the average after updating the score:\n   - New average = (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5\n\n5. `deactivate_student` is then called with student_id=1, setting the 'active' status of student 1 to False. The list now looks like:\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=95, active=False\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n6. Recalculating the average after deactivating student 1:\n   - New average = 90 (since only active students' scores are considered)\n\nFrom these steps, we can see that the average score decreased from 92.5 to 90 when student 1 was deactivated. However, the question asks if we can conclude that the increase in average score (from 87.5 to 92.5) was caused by making an inactive student with a high score active.\n\nSince no student was made active in the sequence of operations provided, and the score increase happened after updating the score of an active student, we cannot conclude that the increase in average score was caused by making an inactive student with a high score active.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. Initially, we have two active students with scores of 85 and 90.\n2. The initial average score is calculated as (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5, which matches the given output.\n\n3. The `update_score` function is called with `student_id` 1 and a new score of 95. This changes the score of the first student from 85 to 95.\n4. Recalculating the average after updating the score:\n   - New scores: 95 and 90\n   - New average: (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5, which matches the given output.\n\n5.
