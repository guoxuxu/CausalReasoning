  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Removing the 'age' field means 'is_adult' key will not be added as its condition won't be fulfilled. This results in the 'credit_score' key not being computed since it relies on the 'is_adult' key. Consequently, 'loan_approval', which depends on 'credit_score', will not be calculated.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If 'age' is present and >= 18, it leads to 'is_adult' being True, which, along with 'purchase_history', can lead to a 'credit_score'. If 'credit_score' exceeds 50, it can result in 'loan_approval'. Removing 'age' prevents 'is_adult' from being True, thus 'loan_approval' may not appear.",
