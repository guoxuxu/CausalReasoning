    "Let's break down the function and analyze how the score changes with an increase in 'age' from 1 to 3.\n\n### Initial Conditions (Age = 1):\n- If age is 1, `bonus = 5` (since `age > 2` is False).\n- Let's assume `system_upgrade` is True (the value can be either True or False; we'll consider both cases).\n\n#### Case 1: `system_upgrade` is True\n- `bonus = 5 + 5 = 10`\n- Score = `100 - error_count + 10`\n\n#### Case 2: `system_upgrade` is False\n- `bonus = 5`\n- Score = `100 - error_count + 5`\n\n### New Conditions (Age = 3):\n- If age is 3, `bonus = 10` (since `age > 2` is True).\n- Again, let's assume `system_upgrade` is True (considering the same scenarios as above).\n\n#### Case 1: `system_upgrade` is True\n- `bonus = 10 + 5 = 15`\n- Score = `100 - error_count + 15`\n\n#### Case 2: `system_upgrade` is False\n- `bonus = 10`\n- Score = `100 - error_count + 10`\n\n### Comparison:\n- **Case 1 (Initial):** `100 - error_count + 10`\n- **Case 1 (New):** `100 - error_count + 15`\n\nIn this case, the score definitely increases from `100 - error_count + 10` to `100 - error_count + 15`.\n\n- **Case 2 (Initial):** `100 - error_count + 5`\n- **Case 2 (New):** `100 - error_count + 10`\n\nSimilarly, the score also increases from `100 - error_count + 5` to `100 - error_count + 10`.\n\nGiven that the only factor changing here is the 'age', and it consistently increases the 'bonus' regardless of the initial conditions, the score will always increase when 'age' increases from 1 to 3.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition (Age = 1):**\n   - `bonus` for age > 2 is 5.\n   - For age = 1, the bonus is 5 (since it's not greater than 2).\n   - If there is a system upgrade (`system_upgrade` is True), the bonus increases by another 5, making it 10.\n   - If there is no system upgrade (`system_upgrade` is False), the bonus remains 5.\n\n2. **Final Score Calculation (Age = 1):**\n   - With system upgrade: `score = 100 - error_count + 10`\n   - Without system upgrade: `score = 100 - error_count + 5`\n\n3. **Condition (Age = 2):**\n   - The bonus for age > 2 is 10.\n   - If there is a system upgrade, the bonus increases by another 5, making it 15.\n   - If there is no system upgrade, the bonus remains 10.\n\n4. **Final Score Calculation (Age = 2):**\n   - With system upgrade: `score = 100 - error_count + 15`\n   - Without system upgrade: `score = 100 - error_count + 10`\n\n5. **Condition (Age = 3 and above):**\n   - The bonus for age > 2 is 10.\n   - If there is a system upgrade, the bonus increases by another 5, making it 15.\n   - If there is no system upgrade, the bonus remains 10.\n\n6. **Final Score Calculation (Age = 3 and above):**\n   - With system upgrade: `score = 100 - error_count + 15`\n   - Without system upgrade: `score = 100 - error_count + 10`\n\nNow, let's compare the scores:\n\n- **From Age = 1 to Age = 2:**\n  - With system upgrade: `100 - error_count + 10` (new) vs `100 - error_count + 5` (old) -> Increase\n  - Without system upgrade: `100 - error_count + 5` (new) vs `100 - error_count + 5` (old) -> No change\n\n- **From Age = 2 to Age = 3 and above:**\n  - With system upgrade: `100 - error_count + 15` (new) vs `100 - error_count + 10` (old) -> Increase\n  - Without system upgrade: `100 - error_count + 10` (new) vs `100 - error_count + 10` (old) -> No change\n\nIn both cases, the score does not decrease; it either increases or stays the same when the age increases from 1 to 3.
