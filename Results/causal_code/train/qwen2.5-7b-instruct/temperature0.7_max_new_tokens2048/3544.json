    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's look at user2's initial state:\n   - Age: 45\n   - Active status: False\n   - Diet quality: 6\n\n2. Now, we need to check user2's activity level using the `activity_level` method:\n   - Since user2 is over 30 (age = 45), we use the second part of the conditional in the `activity_level` method.\n   - The condition checks if `self.active_status` is True or False.\n   - For user2, `self.active_status` is False, so the activity level is set to 'low'.\n\n3. Next, let's consider what happens if we set user2's active_status to True:\n   - We would call `user2.active_status = True`.\n\n4. Now, we need to check if this change affects the activity level:\n   - Again, since user2 is over 30, we use the second part of the conditional in the `activity_level` method.\n   - Now, `self.active_status` is True, so the activity level should be set to 'moderate' based on the new condition.\n\n5.
