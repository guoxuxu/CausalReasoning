  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The method 'willGoHiking()' depends on both 'isSunny' and 'isWeekend' being true. An intervention that sets 'isWeekend' to false overrides any condition even if 'isSunny' is true, thus 'willGoHiking()' will definitely return false.",
  "causal_map": "isWeekend → willGoHiking; isSunny → willGoHiking",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting 'isWeekend' to false directly causes 'willGoHiking()' to return false because 'willGoHiking()' requires both 'isSunny' and 'isWeekend' to be true.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1.

We're asked what happens if we set `isWeekend` to false.\n\n3. If `isWeekend` is false, one of the conditions for `willGoHiking()` is not met (it's not a weekend).\n\n4. Since the method requires both conditions to be true, if either condition is false, the method will return false.\n\n5.
