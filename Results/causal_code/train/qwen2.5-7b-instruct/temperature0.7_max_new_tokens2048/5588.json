  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Since the 'weather_status' function's only parameter and determining factor for setting the weather status is temperature (i.e., warm if greater than 20, otherwise cold), observing a 'Cold' weather status directly implies that the temperature was not greater than 20, according to the code logic.",
  "causal_map": "temperature → weather_status; weather_status → activities; temperature → activities",
  "causal_map_integration": "Temperature directly influences weather status, which in turn influences activities. Temperature → weather_status; temperature → activities.",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The `weather_status` function takes a temperature as input.\n2. If the temperature is greater than 20, it returns 'Warm'.\n3. Otherwise, it returns 'Cold'.\n4. The `decide_activity` function calls `weather_status` with a given temperature.\n5. Based on the returned weather status, it selects a list of activities.\n\nGiven that the observed weather status is 'Cold', we need to determine if this conclusion is correct based on the provided functions.\n\n- For the weather status to be 'Cold', the condition `temp <= 20` must be true in the `weather_status` function.\n- This directly means that the temperature was not higher than 20.\n\nTherefore, if the weather status is observed to be 'Cold', we can indeed conclude that the temperature was not higher than 20.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a function `weather_status(temp)` which returns 'Warm' if the temperature is greater than 20, and 'Cold' otherwise.\n\n2. The `decide_activity(temp)` function calls `weather_status(temp)` to get the weather status.\n\n3. If the weather status is 'Cold', we need to determine if the temperature was not higher than 20.\n\n4. According to the logic in `weather_status(temp)`, a temperature of 15 would definitely result in 'Cold' because 15 is not greater than 20.\n\n5. Therefore, if we observe that the weather status is 'Cold', it confirms that the temperature was not higher than 20.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed conclude that the weather status being 'Cold' is because the temperature was not higher than 20.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
