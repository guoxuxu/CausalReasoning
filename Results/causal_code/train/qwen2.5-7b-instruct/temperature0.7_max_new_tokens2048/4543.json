    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `update_scores` takes three parameters: `score`, `bonus`, and `level`.\n2. It checks if `level` is greater than 5.\n3. If `level` is greater than 5, it adds `bonus * 2` to `score`.\n4. Otherwise, it simply adds `bonus` to `score`.\n\nGiven the values:\n- `user_score = 10`\n- `user_level = 6`\n- `bonus_points = 5`\n\nWe need to determine if changing `bonus_points` directly increases `user_score`.\n\nIn this specific case:\n- Since `user_level` (which is 6) is greater than 5, the condition `if level > 5:` is true.\n- Therefore, the code inside this block will be executed: `score += bonus * 2`.\n- This means `user_score` will be updated to `user_score + bonus_points * 2`.\n\nSo, changing `bonus_points` will indeed change `user_score`, but not directly. The change happens because of the logic within the function.\n\nHowever, the question asks if changing `bonus_points` directly increases `user_score`. \"Directly\" in this context would imply that modifying `bonus_points` results in an immediate and direct modification of `user_score` without any intermediary steps or conditions.\n\nSince `user_score` is only modified based on the value of `bonus_points` through the function call, and not by directly assigning a new value to `user_score` itself, we can conclude that changing `bonus_points` does not directly increase `user_score`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
