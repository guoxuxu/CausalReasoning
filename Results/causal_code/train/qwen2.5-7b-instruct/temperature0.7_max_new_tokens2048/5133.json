    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. Initially, Alice is created with an age of 17.\n2. The `is_adult` attribute is set based on the initial age in the `__init__` method:\n   - `self.is_adult = self.age >= 18` results in `False` for Alice (since 17 < 18).\n3. When `person.birthday()` is called, it calls `update_age(self.age + 1)`, which updates Alice's age to 18 and sets `is_adult` to `True`.\n4. Now, if we manually update Alice's age to 25 using the `update_age` method:\n   - We call `person.update_age(25)`.\n   - Inside `update_age`, `self.age` is set to 25.\n   - Then `self.is_adult` is updated to `self.age >= 18`, which evaluates to `True` (since 25 >= 18).\n\nTherefore, manually updating Alice's age to 25 will indeed affect her `is_adult` status, making it `True`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
