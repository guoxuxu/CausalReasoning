    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The function `compute_sales` calculates the total sales based on the input parameters: `price`, `discount`, and `tax_rate`.\n\n2. **Discount Calculation**:\n   - The `discounted_price` is calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`. This means that if the `discount` increases, the `discounted_price` decreases because we are multiplying the original `price` by a smaller factor (1 - discount).\n\n3. **Tax Calculation**:\n   - The `tax` is then calculated as `discounted_price * tax_rate`. Since `discounted_price` is now smaller due to the increased `discount`, the `tax` will also be smaller.\n\n4. **Total Sales Calculation**:\n   - Finally, the `total_sales` is the sum of `discounted_price` and `tax`: `total_sales = discounted_price + tax`.\n   - Given that both `discounted_price` and `tax` are reduced when the `discount` increases, the `total_sales` will decrease.\n\nTherefore, if you increase the 'discount', the 'total_sales' will decrease, assuming 'price' and 'tax_rate' remain constant.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Formula for Total Sales**:\n   The initial formula provided is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{total\\_sales} = \\text{discounted\\_price} + \\text{tax}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   \\[\n   \\text{discounted\\_price} = \\text{price} \\times (1 - \\text{discount})\n   \\]\n   And:\n   \\[\n   \\text{tax} = \\text{discounted\\_price} \\times \\text{tax\\_rate}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Effect of Increasing Discount**:\n   - When we increase the `discount`, the value inside the parentheses `(1 - discount)` decreases.\n   - This results in a lower `discounted_price` because it is directly multiplied by the `price`.\n   - A lower `discounted_price` means that the amount subject to tax is reduced.\n\n3. **Impact on Tax**:\n   Since the tax is calculated as a percentage of the `discounted_price`, reducing the `discounted_price` also reduces the tax.\n\n4. **Overall Impact on Total Sales**:\n   - The total sales consist of the `discounted_price` plus the tax.\n   - If both the `discounted_price` and the tax are reduced due to an increased discount, then the total sales will decrease.\n\nTherefore, increasing the discount will result in a lower total sales, assuming the `price` and `tax_rate` remain constant.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
