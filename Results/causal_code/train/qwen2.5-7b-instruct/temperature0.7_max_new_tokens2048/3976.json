    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with an instance of `EmployeeSalesData` with some initial values for `sales`, `promotionCount`, and `marketingSpend`.\n\n2. **Apply Promotion Method**:\n   - `promotionCount` is incremented by 1.\n   - `sales` is increased by 500.\n\n3. **Bonus Calculation Before Promotion**:\n   - The bonus is calculated as `(sales * 0.1) + (promotionCount * 50)`.\n\n4. **Bonus Calculation After Promotion**:\n   - After applying the promotion, `sales` becomes `sales + 500`.\n   - `promotionCount` becomes `promotionCount + 1`.\n   - The new bonus would be `(sales + 500) * 0.1 + (promotionCount + 1) * 50`.\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - Let's denote the initial `sales` as `S` and the initial `promotionCount` as `P`.\n   - Initial bonus = `S * 0.1 + P * 50`.\n   - New bonus after promotion = `(S + 500) * 0.1 + (P + 1) * 50`.\n\n6. **Simplifying the New Bonus Expression**:\n   - New bonus = `0.1S + 50 + 50P + 50`.\n   - Simplified = `0.1S + 50P + 100`.\n\n7. **Comparison with Initial Bonus**:\n   - Initial bonus = `0.1S + 50P`.\n   - New bonus = `0.1S + 50P + 100`.\n\nClearly, the new bonus is always greater than the initial bonus because we have added 100 to it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
