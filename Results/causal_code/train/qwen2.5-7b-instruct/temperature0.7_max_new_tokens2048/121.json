    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The class `EnergyUsageCalculator` has an initializer that sets the initial state based on the provided initial temperature.\n\n2.

If the condition is true, `heatingOn` is set to `true`; otherwise, it remains `false`.\n\n5. We are asked specifically about an initial temperature of 15 degrees Celsius.\n\n6. Since 15 is indeed less than 20, the condition `initialTemperature < 20` will evaluate to `true`.\n\n7.
