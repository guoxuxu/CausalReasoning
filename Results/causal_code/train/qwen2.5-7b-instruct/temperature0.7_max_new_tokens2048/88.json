  "Explanation": "The absence of change in 'new_inventory' can occur because the increase in 'units_sold' was exactly equal to the increase in 'current_inventory', balancing out the effects even if 'units_added' is zero.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `update_inventory` takes three parameters:\n   - `sales`, which contains information about units sold (`sales['units_sold']`)\n   - `restock`, which contains information about units added to inventory (`restock['units_added']`)\n   - `current_inventory`, which is the starting inventory level\n\n2. The calculation for `new_inventory` is:\n   - Start with `current_inventory`\n   - Subtract the number of units sold (`sold_units`)\n   - Add the number of units restocked (`restocked_units`)\n\n3. We are asked if the `new_inventory` not changing implies that `units_sold` were zero, given that `units_added` were zero.\n\n4. If `units_added` (from the `restock` parameter) are zero, then the addition part of the equation does not affect the result:\n   - new_inventory = current_inventory - sold_units + 0\n\n5. For `new_inventory` to remain unchanged, the subtraction of `sold_units` must be exactly balanced by some other factor, but since there's no other factor here (as `units_added` is zero), the only way for `new_inventory` to stay the same is if `sold_units` are also zero.\n\n6. Therefore, if `new_inventory` did not change, it must be because `units_sold` were indeed zero.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `update_inventory` takes three parameters:\n   - `sales`, which is expected to have a key `'units_sold'`\n   - `restock`, which is expected to have a key `'units_added'`\n   - `current_inventory`, which is the current state of inventory\n\n2. The function calculates `sold_units` as `sales['units_sold']` and `restocked_units` as `restock['units_added']`.\n\n3. It then computes `new_inventory` as:\n   ```\n   new_inventory = current_inventory - sold_units + restocked_units\n   ```\n\n4. If `restocked_units` (from `restock['units_added']`) is zero, the equation simplifies to:\n   ```\n   new_inventory = current_inventory - sold_units\n   ```\n\n5. For `new_inventory` to be unchanged from `current_inventory`, the term `- sold_units` must equal zero, meaning `sold_units` must also be zero.\n\n6. Therefore, if `units_added` (restocked_units) are zero and `new_inventory` did not change, it implies that `units_sold` (sold_units) must also be zero.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `update_inventory` takes three parameters:\n   - `sales`: A dictionary containing information about units sold.\n   - `restock`: A dictionary containing information about units added to inventory.\n   - `current_inventory`: The current inventory level.\n\n2. The function calculates `sold_units` from the `sales` dictionary and `restocked_units` from the `restock` dictionary.\n\n3. It then computes the new inventory level using the formula:\n   `new_inventory = current_inventory - sold_units + restocked_units`.\n\n4. We need to determine if `new_inventory` not changing (i.e., remaining equal to `current_inventory`) implies that both `units_sold` and `units_added` are zero.\n\n5. Let's consider the equation for new inventory:\n   \\[\n   \\text{new\\_inventory} = \\text{current\\_inventory} - \\text{sold\\_units} + \\text{restocked\\_units}\n   \\]\n\n6. If `new_inventory` remains unchanged, it means:\n   \\[\n   \\text{current\\_inventory} = \\text{current\\_inventory} - \\text{sold\\_units} + \\text{restocked\\_units}\n   \\]\n\n7. Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   0 = - \\text{sold\\_units} + \\text{restocked\\_units}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{sold\\_units} = \\text{restocked\\_units}\n   \\]\n\n8. Given that `restocked_units` is zero (`restock['units_added'] == 0`), the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{sold\\_units} = 0\n   \\]\n\n9. However, the question asks if `new_inventory` not changing necessarily implies that both `units_sold` and `units_added` are zero. From our derivation, we only concluded that `units_sold` must be zero when `units_added` is zero. There is no information provided that `units_added` must also be zero for `new_inventory` to remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
