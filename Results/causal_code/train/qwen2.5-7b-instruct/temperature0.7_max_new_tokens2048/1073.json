    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `evaluate_performance` method checks two conditions for promotion:\n   - If `sales_figures > 100000`\n   - If `previous_performance == 'excellent' and sales_figures > 50000`\n\n2. If the first condition (`sales_figures > 100000`) is met, the `is_promoted` attribute is set to True, regardless of the value of `previous_performance`.\n\n3. If the first condition is not met, it then checks the second condition:\n   - This condition requires both `previous_performance == 'excellent'` and `sales_figures > 50000` to be true simultaneously.\n\n4. Therefore, while sales figures above 100000 do guarantee a promotion (as they meet the first condition), there are other scenarios where an employee can also get promoted without reaching this threshold.\n\n5. However, the question specifically asks if increasing sales figures above 100000 guarantees a promotion, and based on the code provided, this is indeed the case.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The key point here is that the first condition (sales > 100000) is mutually exclusive with the second condition for determining promotion status.\n\n5.

If the `previous_performance` is not 'excellent', even if sales figures exceed 100000, the employee will still not be promoted.\n\n5.
