    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Conditions for Administering Medications**:\n   - If `age > 50` and the patient has a 'cough', they get 'DrugA'.\n   - If `age <= 50` and the patient has a 'fever', they get 'DrugB'.\n   - Otherwise, they get 'DrugC'.\n\n2. **Side Effects of Medications**:\n   - 'DrugA' causes 'drowsiness' and 'nausea'.\n   - 'DrugB' causes 'rash' and 'headache'.\n   - 'DrugC' does not explicitly list any side effects.\n\n3. **Question Analysis**:\n   - The question asks if a patient who did not show any side effects might have been administered 'DrugC'.\n   - Since 'DrugC' is the default option when neither of the specific conditions for 'DrugA' or 'DrugB' are met, it could be administered to patients who do not fit those criteria.\n   - 'DrugC' does not cause any side effects listed (none).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - A patient who did not show any side effects could indeed have been administered 'DrugC', as 'DrugC' does not cause any side effects.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
