  "Explanation": "Although one scenario where 'heater_on' is True is when 'current_temp' is significantly lower than 'desired_temp', 'heater_on' being True does not exclusively specify this condition because the initial temperature state is inadequately communicated by 'heater_on' alone.

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `adjust_temperature` takes two parameters: `sensor` and `desired_temp`.\n2. It first gets the current temperature reading using `get_reading(sensor)`, storing it in `current_temp`.\n3. It then checks if `current_temp` is less than `desired_temp - 5`.\n4. If true, it sets `heater_on` to `True` and increases the temperature by `desired_temp - current_temp`.\n5. If `current_temp` is greater than `desired_temp + 5`, it decreases the temperature.\n6. Otherwise, no action is taken.\n\nThe key part of the question is whether `heater_on` being `True` can be used to infer that `current_temp` was significantly lower than `desired_temp`.\n\nFrom the code:\n- If `heater_on` is `True`, it means the condition `current_temp < desired_temp - 5` was met.\n- This directly implies that `current_temp` was indeed significantly lower than `desired_temp` (by at least 5 degrees).\n\nTherefore, we can confidently infer that if `heater_on` is `True`, `current_temp` was significantly lower than `desired_temp`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `adjust_temperature` function to reason through this:\n\n1. The function starts by getting the current temperature from the sensor.\n2. It checks if the current temperature is below the desired temperature minus 5 degrees.\n3. If it is, the heater is turned on (`heater_on = True`) and the temperature is increased by the difference between the desired temperature and the current temperature.\n4. If the current temperature is above the desired temperature plus 5 degrees, it decreases the temperature, but this is not relevant to our question since we are only considering the case where `heater_on` is True.\n\nGiven that `heater_on` is True, we know from the code that the condition `current_temp < desired_temp - 5` must have been true for the heater to be turned on. This means the current temperature was indeed significantly lower than the desired temperature by at least 5 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The condition `current_temp < desired_temp - 5` means that the current temperature is at least 5 degrees below the desired temperature.\n4. If `heater_on` is True, it implies that the current temperature did not meet the threshold of being within 5 degrees of the desired temperature.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that if `heater_on` is True, then `current_temp` must have been significantly lower than `desired_temp` (at least 5 degrees lower).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The question asks if `heater_on` being True allows us to infer that `current_temp` was significantly lower than `desired_temp`.\n\n6. According to the logic of the code, `heater_on` is set to True only when `current_temp < desired_temp - 5`.\n\n7.

Therefore, while `heater_on` being True does indicate that the temperature was below the threshold, it doesn't necessarily mean it was \"significantly\" lower, as \"significantly\" could imply a larger margin beyond just 5 degrees.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot definitively infer that the current temperature was significantly lower than the desired temperature based solely on `heater_on` being True.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"

    "Let's break down the logic of the `adjust_temperature` function step by step:\n\n1. **Get Current Temperature**: The function starts by getting the current temperature from the sensor.\n2. **Check Conditions**:\n   - If the current temperature is less than `desired_temp - 5`, it means the current temperature is significantly lower than the desired temperature.\n     - In this case, `heater_on` is set to `True`.\n     - The temperature is increased by the difference between `desired_temp` and `current_temp`.\n   - If the current temperature is greater than `desired_temp + 5`, it means the current temperature is significantly higher than the desired temperature.\n     - In this case, `decrease_temperature` is called with the difference between `current_temp` and `desired_temp`.\n\n3. **Return `heater_on` Status**: The function returns whether the heater is on (`True`) or not (`False`).\n\nGiven these conditions, if `heater_on` is `True`, it implies that the current temperature was significantly lower than the desired temperature (by more than 5 degrees).
