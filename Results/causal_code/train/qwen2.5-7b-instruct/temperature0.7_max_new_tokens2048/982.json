  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Even with the control of pressure, the heating of the system through the 'heat_system' method can result in a temperature rise above 30 degrees Celsius, which triggers an increase in humidity. The control of pressure does not directly prevent the humidity from increasing as a result of the temperature surpassing 30 degrees.",
  "causal_map": "temperature → humidity; pressure → temperature",
  "causal_map_integration": "Heating the system increases its temperature, which can increase humidity if the temperature exceeds 30°C. Keeping the pressure below 1.5 atmospheres prevents the temperature from increasing by 3°C when the pressure is increased, thus potentially preventing humidity from increasing due to temperature changes.",
