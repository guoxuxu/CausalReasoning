  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'coupon_code' to 'SUMMER20' causes the 'discount' to be set at 0.2 (20%). This discount is applied to the 'price', reducing the 'final_price' by 20% of the original price, thus guaranteeing 'final_price' is lower than the initial 'price'.",
  "causal_map": "coupon_code → discount; discount → final_price",
  "causal_map_integration": "The coupon code influences the discount applied, which in turn reduces the final price from the initial price.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_discount` takes two parameters: `price` and `coupon_code`.\n2. If `coupon_code` is 'SUMMER20', the discount assigned is 0.2 (which means 20% off).\n3. The final price is calculated as `price - (price * discount)`.\n4. If the discount is 0.2, then the calculation for the final price would be:\n   - `final_price = price - (price * 0.2)`\n   - This simplifies to `final_price = price * (1 - 0.2)`\n   - Which further simplifies to `final_price = price * 0.8`\n5. Multiplying the original price by 0.8 results in a price that is 80% of the original price.\n6. Since 80% is less than 100%, the final price will indeed be lower than the initial price.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
