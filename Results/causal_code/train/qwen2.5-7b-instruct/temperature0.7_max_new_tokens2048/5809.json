  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "With the intervention of artificial humidifiers, the winter base humidity level rises to 50. If it rains (adding an extra 10), the humidity level will reach 60. This is below the threshold of 80 needed for 'High humidity', therefore the display will continue indicating 'Normal humidity'.",

  "causal_map_integration": "In winter, when it is raining, the humidity level increases to 60, which will cause the display to show 'High humidity'.",
