    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `increaseTemperature()` method checks two conditions:\n   - It ensures that the AC is not on (`!acState`).\n   - It also ensures that the number of degrees to increase is greater than 0 (`degrees > 0`).\n\n2. If both conditions are met, it performs the following actions:\n   - Increases the temperature by the specified number of degrees.\n   - Sets the `heaterState` to true.\n\n3. The key point here is the condition `!acState`. As long as the AC is not on, the method will set `heaterState` to true.\n\n4. Given that the question specifies calling `increaseTemperature()` with a positive degree, the first condition (`degrees > 0`) is always satisfied.\n\n5. Therefore, as long as the AC is not already on, `heaterState` will be set to true.\n\nSince the problem description does not specify that the AC is currently on (and the default state is false), we can conclude that under normal circumstances, calling `increaseTemperature()` with a positive degree will indeed make `heaterState` become true.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `increaseTemperature()` method is called with a positive number of degrees.\n\n2. The method checks two conditions:\n   - `!acState`: This means the AC (air conditioner) must not be on.\n   - `degrees > 0`: This condition is already met since a positive number was passed.\n\n3. If both conditions are true, the method proceeds to:\n   - Increase the `temperature` by the given number of degrees.\n   - Set `heaterState` to true.\n\n4. Since the conditions are met (assuming no other state changes), the `heaterState` will indeed be set to true after calling `increaseTemperature()` with a positive degree.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `increaseTemperature()` method takes an integer parameter `degrees`.\n\n2. Inside the method, there are two conditions:\n   - The first condition checks if `!acState` (i.e., the AC is not on)\n   - The second condition checks if `degrees > 0`\n\n3. If both conditions are true, then:\n   - `temperature` is increased by `degrees`\n   - `heaterState` is set to `true`\n\n4. The question specifically asks about what happens when a positive degree is passed to the method.\n\n5. If `degrees` is positive, the second condition (`degrees > 0`) will always be true.\n\n6.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `increaseTemperature()` method is called with a positive integer value for `degrees`.\n\n2.

On the next line, the temperature is increased by the number of degrees passed as an argument.\n\n4. Then, the `heaterState` is set to true.\n\n5. If either of the initial conditions (not `acState` being false or `degrees` not being greater than 0) is not met, the method does not execute the line that sets `heaterState` to true.\n\nGiven that the method only sets `heaterState` to true when the conditions are met, we can conclude that if `increaseTemperature()` is called with a positive degree and all other conditions are satisfied, `heaterState` will indeed become true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
