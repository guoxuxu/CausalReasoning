    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_scores` calculates `s1` based on the values of `data['A']`, `data['B']`, and `data['C']`.\n\n2. Then it checks the value of `data['D']`:\n   - If `data['D'] > 0`, `s2` is set to `s1 * 2`.\n   - Otherwise, `s2` is set to `s1 - 10`.\n\n3. For `s2` to have \"significantly increased\", it must be much larger than `s1`. \n\n4. The only way for `s2` to be significantly larger than `s1` is if `s2` becomes `s1 * 2` (i.e., when `data['D'] > 0`).\n\n5. If `data['D'] <= 0`, then `s2` would only decrease or stay the same compared to `s1` (it could potentially stay the same if `s1 - 10` is still greater than `s1`, but generally, it will decrease).\n\n6. Therefore, if `s2` has significantly increased, it strongly suggests that `data['D']` was indeed positive.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Calculation of `s2`:**\n   - The initial value of `s1` is calculated as \\(5 \\times \\text{data['A']} + 3 \\times \\text{data['B']} - \\text{data['C']}\\).\n   - If `data['D']` is greater than 0, then `s2` is set to `s1 * 2`.\n   - If `data['D']` is not greater than 0 (i.e., it is less than or equal to 0), then `s2` is set to `s1 - 10`.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Impact of `D`:**\n   - If `data['D'] > 0`, then `s2` will be `s1 * 2`. This means `s2` could be significantly larger than `s1`.\n   - If `data['D'] <= 0`, then `s2` will be `s1 - 10`. This means `s2` would be smaller than `s1` but not necessarily significantly smaller unless `s1` is very small.\n\n3. **Determining When `s2` Increases Significantly:**\n   - For `s2` to increase significantly, it must become much larger than its initial value `s1`. Given the formula, the only way for `s2` to be significantly larger than `s1` is when `data['D'] > 0` because multiplying `s1` by 2 will generally result in a larger number compared to subtracting 10 from `s1`.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - If `s2` has significantly increased, it strongly suggests that `data['D']` was indeed positive, because the only scenario where `s2` increases significantly is when `data['D'] > 0`.\n\nTherefore, based on the logic above, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the calculation of `s2`:**\n   - The value of `s2` is determined by the value of `D`.\n   - If `data['D'] > 0`, then `s2 = s1 * 2`.\n   - If `data['D'] <= 0`, then `s2 = s1 - 10`.\n\n2. **Analyzing the effect of `D` on `s2`:**\n   - When `D` is positive, `s2` is doubled compared to `s1`.\n   - When `D` is non-positive (0 or negative), `s2` is reduced by 10 compared to `s1`.\n\n3. **Determining when `s2` would be significantly increased:**\n   - For `s2` to be significantly increased, it must be substantially higher than `s1`.\n   - Doubling `s1` (when `D > 0`) is more likely to result in a significant increase compared to reducing `s1` by 10.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - If `s2` has significantly increased, it is most likely because `D` was positive, leading to `s2 = s1 * 2`.\n\nTherefore, based on the given logic, we can reasonably infer that if `s2` has significantly increased, then `D` was indeed positive.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The formula for calculating `s1` is `5 * data['A'] + 3 * data['B'] - data['C']`. This part of the calculation is independent of whether `data['D']` is positive or negative.\n\n2. The value of `s2` depends on the value of `data['D']`:\n   - If `data['D'] > 0`, then `s2 = s1 * 2`\n   - If `data['D'] <= 0`, then `s2 = s1 - 10`\n\n3. To determine if `s2` has significantly increased, we need to compare the two possible values of `s2`:\n   - When `data['D'] > 0`: `s2 = s1 * 2`\n   - When `data['D'] <= 0`: `s2 = s1 - 10`\n\n4. Comparing these two scenarios:\n   - `s1 * 2` (when `D` is positive) will always be greater than `s1 - 10` (when `D` is non-positive), assuming `s1` is not extremely negative.\n\n5. Therefore, if `s2` has significantly increased, it would imply that `s2` took on the value `s1 * 2`, which only happens when `data['D'] > 0`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that if `s2` has significantly increased, we can indeed infer that `D` was positive.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

For 's2' to be significantly increased, it must be at least twice as large when D > 0 compared to when D ≤ 0.\n\n5. Let's assume the original value of 's1' is X (we don't know its exact value but we can use this variable for comparison).\n\n6. If D > 0, then s2 = 2X.\n7. If D ≤ 0, then s2 = X - 10.\n\n8.
