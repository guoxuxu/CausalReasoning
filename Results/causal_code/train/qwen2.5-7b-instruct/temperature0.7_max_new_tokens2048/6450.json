    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthSystem` class has a private boolean `active` that can be set to true or false.\n2. The `activate()` method sets `active` to true and calls `alertStatus()`.\n3. The `deactivate()` method sets `active` to false and calls `alertStatus()`.\n4. The `alertStatus()` method checks the value of `active` and prints either \"System is active.\" or \"System is inactive.\"\n5. If `active` is hardcoded to always be true, `alertStatus()` will always print \"System is active.\"\n\nNow, considering the question:\n- We know that \"System is active.\" is printed.\n- This could happen if `active` is hardcoded to true.\n- However, it could also happen if `activate()` was called, setting `active` to true.\n\nGiven these points, we cannot conclusively determine that `activate()` was the only method that could have caused the message to be printed. The system could be active due to a hardcoded value or due to an invocation of the `activate()` method.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `active` variable is hardcoded to always be `true`.\n\n2. **Behavior of Methods**:\n   - `activate()` sets `active` to `true` and calls `alertStatus()`.\n   - `deactivate()` sets `active` to `false` and calls `alertStatus()`.\n   - `alertStatus()` checks the value of `active` and prints a corresponding message.\n\n3. **Hardcoding and Initial Value**:\n   - Since `active` is hardcoded to `true`, it means the system will always print \"System is active.\" regardless of whether `activate()` or `deactivate()` is called directly.\n   \n4. **Invoking Methods**:\n   - If `activate()` is invoked, it will set `active` to `true` and call `alertStatus()`, which will print \"System is active.\"\n   - However, if `active` is already `true` due to being hardcoded, invoking `activate()` again won't change its value, but `alertStatus()` will still be called, printing \"System is active.\"\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that `active` is hardcoded to `true`, the system will always print \"System is active.\" even without invoking `activate()`. \n   - Therefore, just because \"System is active.\" is printed does not necessarily mean that the `activate()` method was invoked. It could also be due to the hardcoded value.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot conclusively say that the `activate()` method was invoked solely based on the printed message.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

The `alertStatus()` method checks the value of `active`. If it's `true`, it prints \"System is active.\" If it's `false`, it prints \"System is inactive.\"\n\n5. We are asked about a scenario where `active` is hardcoded to always be `true`.\n\n6. If `active` is hardcoded to `true`, the `alertStatus()` method will always print \"System is active.\"\n\n7.

The `active` field could have been set to `true` in other ways as well:\n   - It could have been set directly.\n   - Another method could have set it to `true`.\n   - The constructor could have initialized it to `true`.\n\n9.
