    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The `exercise` method takes an argument `duration_minutes`, which represents the duration of the exercise.\n\n2. Inside the `exercise` method:\n   - `self.heart_rate += 0.1 * duration_minutes`\n     This line increases the heart rate by 10% of the exercise duration.\n   - `self.intake_calories += 0.2 * duration_minutes`\n     This line increases the calorie intake by 20% of the exercise duration.\n\n3. Both these operations directly depend on the value of `duration_minutes`.\n\n4. If the `duration_minutes` increases:\n   - The heart rate will increase proportionally to the increase in `duration_minutes`.\n   - The calorie intake will also increase proportionally to the increase in `duration_minutes`.\n\nTherefore, if the exercise duration increases, both the heart rate and calorie intake will indeed increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The `exercise` method in the `HealthMonitor` class takes a parameter `duration_minutes`, which represents the duration of the exercise.\n\n2.

The first line increases the heart rate by 10% of the exercise duration (in minutes).\n4. The second line increases the calorie intake by 20% of the exercise duration (in minutes).\n\n5. Both changes are directly proportional to the `duration_minutes` parameter.
