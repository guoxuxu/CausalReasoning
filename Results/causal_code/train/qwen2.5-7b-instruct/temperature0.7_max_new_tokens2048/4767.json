  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "While the state will be set to 'gas' if the temperature is above 100 degrees, the state might not always remain 'gas' if other interventions occur. For example, an increase in pressure can change other properties like compressibility or density but does not affect the state directly determined by temperature in this code.",
