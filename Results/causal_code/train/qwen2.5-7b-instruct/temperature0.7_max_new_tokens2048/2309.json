    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We have a `TrafficLight` object initialized with `green_light_duration = 30` and `yellow_light_duration = 5`.\n   - The `red_light_duration` is calculated as `max(30, green_light_duration + yellow_light_duration - 10)`, which results in `red_light_duration = 35`.\n\n2. **`is_safe_to_cross` Method**:\n   - For the yellow light (`light_color == 'yellow'`), the method returns `True` only if `yellow_light_duration < 5`.\n\n3. **Initial Check**:\n   - Initially, `yellow_light_duration = 5`, so `is_safe_to_cross('yellow')` returns `False` because `5 < 5` is `False`.\n\n4. **Modification**:\n   - An external function `update_light_durations` modifies `yellow_light_duration` to be less than 5 (e.g., to 4).\n\n5. **Re-evaluation**:\n   - After the modification, `yellow_light_duration = 4`.\n   - When calling `is_safe_to_cross('yellow')` again, it now checks `4 < 5`, which is `True`.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Yes, if `yellow_light_duration` is modified to be less than 5, the `is_safe_to_cross` function will change its return value for the yellow light from `False` to `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `TrafficLight` object is initialized with `green_light_duration` of 30 and `yellow_light_duration` of 5.\n2. **Red Light Duration Calculation**: \n   - `red_light_duration` is calculated as `max(30, green_light_duration + yellow_light_duration - 10)`.\n   - With the initial values, `red_light_duration` would be `max(30, 30 + 5 - 10)`, which is 35.\n3. **Initial Safety Check**:\n   - The `is_safe_to_cross` method checks if the light color is 'yellow'.\n   - For a yellow light, it returns `True` only if `yellow_light_duration < 5`.\n   - Initially, since `yellow_light_duration` is 5, `is_safe_to_cross('yellow')` returns `False`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if we modify the `yellow_light_duration` to be less than 5:\n\n4. **Modification**:\n   - An external function (`update_light_durations`) changes `yellow_light_duration` to a value less than 5.\n5. **Safety Check After Modification**:\n   - If `yellow_light_duration` is now, say, 4 (less than 5), then when `is_safe_to_cross` is called with 'yellow', it will return `True` because `4 < 5`.\n\nGiven that the `is_safe_to_cross` function does indeed check if `yellow_light_duration < 5` and returns `True` if this condition is met, changing `yellow_light_duration` to be less than 5 will cause the `is_safe_to_cross` function to return `True` for a yellow light.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
