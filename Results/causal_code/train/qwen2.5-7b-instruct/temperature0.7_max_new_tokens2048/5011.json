    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We have a function `update_temperature` that takes three parameters: `settings`, `current_temp`, and `is_heating_on`.\n\n2. The condition we are focusing on is when `is_heating_on` is set to `True`.\n\n3. Within this condition, there's an `if` statement that checks if `current_temp` is less than `settings['desired_temp'] - settings['threshold']`.\n\n4. If the above condition is true (i.e., `current_temp` is below `desired_temp` minus `threshold`), the code inside the `if` block will execute.\n\n5. Inside the `if` block, the code increments `current_temp` by `settings['increase_rate']`.\n\nGiven these steps, if `is_heating_on` is `True` and `current_temp` is below `desired_temp` minus `threshold`, then `current_temp` will indeed increase.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
