    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `alarm` variable is set to true when the `temperature` exceeds 100.\n2. The `resetAlarm()` method sets `alarm` to false if the `temperature` is less than or equal to 100.\n3. If the `alarm` is observed as true, it means the condition for setting `alarm` to true (i.e., `temperature > 100`) must have been met at some point.\n4. However, between the time the `alarm` was last set to true and the current observation, there could have been a call to `resetAlarm()` which would have set `alarm` back to false if the `temperature` was then less than or equal to 100.\n5. Therefore, observing `alarm` as true does not guarantee that the `temperature` has never been less than or equal to 100 since the last time `alarm` was set to true.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot definitively conclude that the temperature was always above 100 before any potential `resetAlarm` call.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `alarm` variable is set to true when the `temperature` exceeds 100.\n2. The `resetAlarm()` method only sets `alarm` to false if the `temperature` is less than or equal to 100.\n3. This means that `resetAlarm()` will not change `alarm` to false if the `temperature` is still above 100 after calling it.\n4. Therefore, if we observe that `alarm` is true, it must have been set to true due to the `temperature` exceeding 100 at some point.\n5. However, there could be a scenario where the `resetAlarm()` method was called after the temperature exceeded 100 but before the observation, which would have set `alarm` back to false.\n6.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the `increaseTemp` method**:\n   - This method increases the `temperature` by a given amount (`increment`).\n   - If the new `temperature` exceeds 100, it sets `alarm` to `true`.\n\n2. **Understanding the `resetAlarm` method**:\n   - This method only resets the `alarm` to `false` if the current `temperature` is less than or equal to 100.\n   - It does not change the `temperature` value.\n\n3. **Observing the `alarm` as `true`**:\n   - If `alarm` is observed to be `true`, it means that at some point, the `temperature` was increased to a value greater than 100.\n\n4. **Potential for `resetAlarm` being called**:\n   - The `resetAlarm` method could have been called after the `temperature` exceeded 100 but before the observation of `alarm` being `true`.\n   - However, for `alarm` to be `true` at the time of observation, the `temperature` must have been greater than 100 at least once since the last reset (if any).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that `alarm` is `true`, it is definitive that the `temperature` was higher than 100 at some point, even if a `resetAlarm` call has been made subsequently.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

However, between the time the `alarm` was triggered and the time it is observed as `true`, there could have been a `resetAlarm()` call that reset the `alarm` to `false` without changing the `temperature` back to below 100.\n\nTherefore, just observing that the `alarm` is `true` does not definitively mean that the `temperature` was higher than 100 before any potential `resetAlarm()` call.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
