    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `restock` method is called with parameters for an item, quantity to add, and the cost per unit.\n\n2. It first checks if the store has enough balance (`self.balance`) to cover the cost of restocking:\n   - If not, it returns False without modifying the inventory.\n\n3. Assuming the balance check passes, it proceeds to update the inventory:\n   - If the item already exists in `self.inventory`, it increases the existing quantity.\n   - If the item does not exist, it creates a new entry in `self.inventory` with the specified quantity.\n\n4. Regardless of whether the item was added or increased, the method ensures that the inventory for that item will be updated to reflect the new quantity.\n\n5. Therefore, as long as the `restock` method completes successfully (i.e., the balance check passes), the inventory for the particular item will indeed increase.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
