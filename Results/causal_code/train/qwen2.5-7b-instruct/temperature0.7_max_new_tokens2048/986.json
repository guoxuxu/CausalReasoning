    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `MotionSensor` class has two main states to consider:\n   - `isActive`: A boolean that determines whether the sensor is active.\n   - `detectedMovements`: An integer counter for the number of movements detected.\n\n2. The `activate()` method sets `isActive` to true, allowing the sensor to start detecting movements.\n\n3. The `detectMovement()` method increments `detectedMovements` only if `isActive` is true.\n\n4. The `isAlarmTriggered()` method checks if both `isActive` is true AND `detectedMovements` is greater than 5.\n\n5. For the alarm to be triggered, we need:\n   - `isActive` to be true (which can be achieved by calling `activate()`)\n   - `detectedMovements` to be greater than 5\n\n6. If we call `activate()`, it sets `isActive` to true. \n\n7. We then need to call `detectMovement()` at least 6 times after activating the sensor for the alarm to trigger (`detectedMovements > 5`).\n\n8. There's no upper limit on how many times `detectMovement()` can be called, so theoretically, we could call it 6 times or more after activation.\n\nTherefore, with subsequent movements, the alarm can indeed be triggered.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `MotionSensor` class to determine if the alarm can be triggered after calling the `activate` method:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The sensor is initially inactive (`isActive = false`) and has no detected movements (`detectedMovements = 0`).\n\n2. **Activation**:\n   - When `activate()` is called, `isActive` is set to `true`.\n\n3. **Detection of Movements**:\n   - Each time `detectMovement()` is called, if the sensor is active (`isActive` is `true`), the `detectedMovements` counter is incremented.\n\n4. **Alarm Trigger Condition**:\n   - The alarm is triggered if both conditions are met:\n     - The sensor is active (`isActive` is `true`).\n     - More than 5 movements have been detected (`detectedMovements > 5`).\n\nNow, let's reason through the scenario:\n\n- After calling `activate()`, the sensor becomes active.\n- For the alarm to trigger, we need more than 5 movements to be detected while the sensor remains active.\n- If `detectMovement()` is called multiple times while the sensor is active, the `detectedMovements` count will increase.\n- Once `detectedMovements` exceeds 5, the condition `detectedMovements > 5` will be satisfied.\n- As long as the sensor remains active (`isActive` stays `true`), the alarm condition will persist.\n\nTherefore, if `activate()` is called and `detectMovement()` is called at least 6 times subsequently, the alarm will indeed be triggered.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `isActive` is initially set to `false`.\n   - `detectedMovements` is initially set to `0`.\n\n2. **Calling `activate()`**:\n   - This sets `isActive` to `true`.\n\n3. **Subsequent Movement Detection**:\n   - The `detectMovement()` method increments `detectedMovements` only if `isActive` is `true`.\n   - Each time `detectMovement()` is called when `isActive` is `true`, `detectedMovements` will increase by 1.\n\n4. **Alarm Trigger Condition**:\n   - The `isAlarmTriggered()` method returns `true` if both `isActive` is `true` AND `detectedMovements` is greater than 5.\n   - Since `isActive` becomes `true` after calling `activate()`, we need to check how many times `detectMovement()` needs to be called for `detectedMovements` to exceed 5.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If `detectMovement()` is called 6 times after activating the sensor, `detectedMovements` will become 6.\n   - With `isActive` being `true`, the condition `isActive && detectedMovements > 5` will be satisfied, triggering the alarm.\n\nTherefore, if `activate()` is called and `detectMovement()` is subsequently called at least 6 times, the alarm will be triggered.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `MotionSensor` class has an `isActive` flag that determines whether the sensor is active.\n2. It also keeps track of `detectedMovements`, which increments every time `detectMovement()` is called while the sensor is active.\n3. The `activate()` method sets `isActive` to true.\n4. The `deactivate()` method sets `isActive` to false.\n5. The `detectMovement()` method checks if the sensor is active (`isActive` is true). If it is, it increments `detectedMovements`.\n6. The `isAlarmTriggered()` method returns true if both `isActive` is true and `detectedMovements` is greater than 5.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we call `activate()`:\n\n- When `activate()` is called, `isActive` is set to true.\n- Subsequent calls to `detectMovement()` will increment `detectedMovements` as long as `isActive` remains true.\n- For the alarm to be triggered, `detectedMovements` must exceed 5, and `isActive` must still be true.\n\nSo, if we call `activate()` and then make at least 6 calls to `detectMovement()` (since `detectedMovements` starts at 0), the alarm will indeed be triggered.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

If we call `activate`, it sets `isActive` to `true`.\n\n7. Subsequent calls to `detectMovement` will increment `detectedMovements` as long as `isActive` remains `true`.\n\n8. Once `detectedMovements` reaches 6, the `isAlarmTriggered` method will return `true`.\n\nTherefore, if the `activate` method is called and there are at least 6 subsequent detections of movement, the alarm will eventually be triggered.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
