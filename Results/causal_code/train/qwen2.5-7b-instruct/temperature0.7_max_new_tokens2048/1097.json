    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial temperature is set to 26 degrees.\n2. The `adjustTemperature()` method checks the current temperature.\n3.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `EnvironmentMonitor` class is initialized with an initial temperature of 26 degrees.\n2. The `adjustTemperature()` method is called.\n3.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `EnvironmentMonitor` class has an initial temperature set to 26 degrees when the object is created.\n2.

In our case, the initial temperature is 26 degrees.\n4. Since 26 is greater than 25, the condition `if (temperature > 25)` is true.\n5. Therefore, the method will execute the block of code inside this if statement:\n   - It sets `airConditioningOn` to `true`.\n   - It subtracts 5 from the current temperature.\n\nGiven these steps, the air conditioning will indeed turn on after calling `adjustTemperature()` with an initial temperature of 26 degrees.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
