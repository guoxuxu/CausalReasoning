    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a function `weather_condition()` that returns one of three possible weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. The `traffic_jam(weather)` function checks the weather condition:\n   - If it's 'rainy', traffic jam is guaranteed to occur (returns True).\n   - If it's 'sunny', traffic jam definitely won't occur (returns False).\n   - For 'cloudy' weather, it randomly decides whether there will be a traffic jam (returns either True or False with equal probability).\n\n3. The question specifically asks about the scenario where the weather is 'sunny'.\n\n4. According to the `traffic_jam(weather)` function, when the weather is 'sunny', it explicitly returns `False`.\n\n5. A return value of `False` for the `traffic_jam()` function means there will not be a traffic jam.\n\nTherefore, if the weather is sunny, the traffic jam will not occur.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

This means that if the weather is sunny, the traffic jam will not occur.\n\nTherefore, if the weather is sunny, the traffic jam will definitely not occur, which means it does not \"likely\" not occur; it will not occur at all.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",

The `car_speed` function determines the speed based on whether there's a traffic jam:\n   - If there is a traffic jam, the speed is set to 25 mph.\n   - If there isn't a traffic jam, the speed is set to 60 mph.\n\n4.
