    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `process_data` function takes an input `input_data`.\n2. It first modifies the data by multiplying it by 2: `modified_data = input_data * 2`.\n3. Then it adds 10 to the modified data: `final_data = modified_data + 10`.\n4. Therefore, the formula for `final_data` in terms of `input_data` is: `final_data = (input_data * 2) + 10`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if `final_data` decreases:\n\n- For `final_data` to decrease, `(input_data * 2) + 10` must result in a smaller value than the previous calculation.\n- Since the addition of 10 is constant, the only way for the expression to decrease is if `input_data * 2` decreases.\n- And the only way for `input_data * 2` to decrease is if `input_data` itself decreases.\n\nTherefore, if `final_data` is observed to decrease, we can indeed infer that `user_input` has definitely decreased, assuming no changes were made to the `process_data` function.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `process_data` function takes an input, multiplies it by 2, and then adds 10 to get the final result.\n2. The formula for `final_data` is: `final_data = input_data * 2 + 10`.\n3. If we increase `input_data`, `modified_data` (which is `input_data * 2`) will also increase, and consequently, `final_data` will increase.\n4. Conversely, if we decrease `input_data`, `modified_data` will decrease, and `final_data` will decrease as well.\n5. The question asks if observing a decrease in `final_data` means that `user_input` has definitely decreased, assuming no changes to the `process_data` function.\n\nGiven the relationship described above, if `final_data` decreases, it must be because `input_data` (or `user_input`) has decreased, as the function does not contain any logic that would cause `final_data` to decrease without a corresponding decrease in `input_data`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

We know that `final_data` is calculated as `2 * input_data + 10`.\n\n3. If `final_data` decreases, it means the value of `2 * input_data + 10` has become smaller.\n\n4. For `2 * input_data + 10` to be smaller, one of two things must have happened:\n   - The value of `input_data` must have decreased.\n   - There must have been some change to the function itself (which is not the case here since the function is unchanged).\n\n5. Since the function `process_data` is fixed and no other variables or external factors are mentioned, the only logical conclusion is that if `final_data` decreases, `input_data` must have decreased.\n\nTherefore, if `final_data` is observed to decrease, we can indeed infer that `user_input` has definitely decreased without any changes to the `process_data` function.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
