    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a `Car` object with `is_fueled` set to `False`.\n2. The `add_fuel(20)` method is called, which sets `is_fueled` to `True` because the condition `if quantity > 0:` is met.\n3. Now, `is_fueled` is `True`.\n4. The `start_engine()` method is called.\n5. Inside `start_engine()`, there's an `if self.is_fueled:` check.\n6. Since `is_fueled` is now `True`, the condition is met, and `self.is_running` is set to `True`.\n\nTherefore, if `is_fueled` is set to `True` before calling `start_engine`, the car's `is_running` attribute will indeed be set to `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

In the `start_engine()` method, there's an if-else statement:\n   - If `self.is_fueled` is True, then `self.is_running` is set to True.\n   - If `self.is_fueled` is False, then `self.is_running` remains False and a message is printed.\n\nGiven that `is_fueled` was set to True by the `add_fuel(20)` call, the condition `if self.is_fueled:` will evaluate to True when `start_engine()` is called.\n\nTherefore, `self.is_running` will be set to True.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have a Car object `car` initialized with `brand='Toyota'` and `is_fueled=False`.\n\n2. The `add_fuel(20)` method is called on this car object. This sets `is_fueled` to True because the condition `if quantity > 0:` is satisfied.\n\n3. Now, the car's state is:\n   - brand: Toyota\n   - is_fueled: True\n   - is_running: False\n\n4. Next, `start_engine()` is called on the car object.\n\n5. In the `start_engine()` method:\n   - It checks if `self.is_fueled` (which is now True).\n   - Since `is_fueled` is True, it sets `self.is_running` to True.\n\n6. Therefore, after calling `start_engine()`, the car's `is_running` attribute will indeed be set to True.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Car` class is defined with attributes `brand`, `is_fueled`, and `is_running`.\n2. The `start_engine` method checks if `is_fueled` is True.\n3. If `is_fueled` is True, it sets `is_running` to True.\n4. If `is_fueled` is False, it prints \"Cannot start engine, no fuel.\" and sets `is_running` to False.\n\nNow let's follow the code execution:\n\n- We create a `Car` object with `brand='Toyota'` and `is_fueled=False`.\n- We call `add_fuel(20)`, which sets `is_fueled` to True.\n- Then we call `start_engine()`. At this point:\n  - `is_fueled` is True (due to the `add_fuel` call).\n- Inside `start_engine`, the condition `if self.is_fueled:` evaluates to True.\n- Therefore, `self.is_running` is set to True.\n\nSo, if a Car object has `is_fueled` set to True before calling `start_engine`, the car's `is_running` attribute will indeed be set to True.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a `Car` object with `is_fueled` initially set to `False`.\n\n2. The `add_fuel` method is called with a quantity of 20. This sets `is_fueled` to `True`.\n\n3. Next, the `start_engine` method is called on the `car` object.\n\n4. Inside `start_engine`, there's an `if` statement that checks if `self.is_fueled` is `True`.\n\n5. Since we've just set `is_fueled` to `True` in the previous step, this condition evaluates to `True`.\n\n6. As a result, the line `self.is_running = True` is executed, setting `is_running` to `True`.\n\n7. The `else` block, which prints a message when there's no fuel, is not executed because the `if` condition was true.\n\nTherefore, after calling `start_engine` on the `car` object with `is_fueled` set to `True`, the `is_running` attribute will indeed be set to `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
