    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `calculateScore` function takes two parameters:\n   - `questionsCorrect`: an integer representing the number of correct answers.\n   - `bonusReceived`: a boolean indicating whether a bonus was received.\n\n2. Inside the function, the score is initially set to `10 * questionsCorrect`.\n\n3. If `bonusReceived` is true, 50 points are added to the score.\n\n4. In the `main` function, `correctAnswers` is set to 8 and `hasBonus` is set to true.\n\n5. The `calculateScore` function is called with these values, resulting in:\n   - Initial score: \\(10 \\times 8 = 80\\)\n   - Since `hasBonus` is true, an additional 50 points are added, making the final score 130.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where we set `bonusReceived` to true, irrespective of the value of `questionsCorrect`:\n\n- Regardless of how many questions are correct (`questionsCorrect`), as long as `bonusReceived` is true, 50 points will always be added to the initial score.\n\nTherefore, setting `bonusReceived` to true will always increase the score, assuming the initial score from `questionsCorrect` is positive.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculateScore` takes two parameters: `questionsCorrect` and `bonusReceived`.\n2. The base score is calculated as `10 * questionsCorrect`.\n3. If `bonusReceived` is true, an additional 50 points are added to the score.\n4. In the `main` function, `correctAnswers` is set to 8 and `hasBonus` is set to true.\n5. The score calculation will be:\n   - Base score: 10 * 8 = 80\n   - Since `hasBonus` is true, an additional 50 points are added: 80 + 50 = 130\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where we intervene to set `bonusReceived` to true, irrespective of `questionsCorrect`:\n\n1. If `bonusReceived` is always true, then the additional 50 points will always be added to the base score.\n2. Even if `questionsCorrect` is 0, the score would still be 10 * 0 + 50 = 50.\n\nIn both cases, setting `bonusReceived` to true results in an increase in the score, because the additional 50 points are always added when `bonusReceived` is true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

We need to determine if setting `bonusReceived` to true will always increase the score, regardless of `questionsCorrect`.\n\n5. Consider the case where `questionsCorrect` is 0:\n   - Initial score: 10 * 0 = 0\n   - With bonus: 0 + 50 = 50\n   - Score increases from 0 to 50.\n\n6. Now consider any positive value for `questionsCorrect`:\n   - Let's say `questionsCorrect` is 1:\n     - Initial score: 10 * 1 = 10\n     - With bonus: 10 + 50 = 60\n     - Score increases from 10 to 60.\n   \n7.
