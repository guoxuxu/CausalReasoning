    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - The `Server` starts with `requestsHandled = 0` and `serverLoad = 'Low'`.\n   - The `Database` starts with `connections = 0` and `dataLoad = 'Low'`.\n\n2. **Function Execution**:\n   - The `simulateActivity` function runs a loop 60 times.\n   - In each iteration, it calls `server.handleRequest('NewRequest')`.\n\n3. **Server Handling Requests**:\n   - Each call to `handleRequest` increments `requestsHandled` by 1.\n   - If `requestsHandled` exceeds 50, `serverLoad` is set to 'High'.\n   \n4. **Check Point**:\n   - Since the loop runs 60 times, `handleRequest` is called 60 times.\n   - This means `requestsHandled` will be incremented 60 times, reaching 60.\n   - At `requestsHandled = 60`, the condition `if (this.requestsHandled > 50)` will be true, setting `serverLoad` to 'High'.\n\n5. **Database Connections**:\n   - Every 5th iteration, `database.openConnection()` is called.\n   - This increments `connections` by 1.\n   - The condition for `dataLoad` to change to 'High' is not relevant here as we are only asked about the serverLoad.\n\nGiven that the loop runs 60 times, and `requestsHandled` will exceed 50, the serverLoad will indeed become 'High' after the 60th request.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `handleRequest` method of the `Server` class increments the `requestsHandled` counter each time it is called.\n2. If `requestsHandled` exceeds 50, the `serverLoad` is set to 'High'.\n3. In the `simulateActivity` function, we call `handleRequest` 60 times.\n4. Each call to `handleRequest` increments `requestsHandled` by 1.\n5. Therefore, after 60 calls, `requestsHandled` will be 60.\n6. Since 60 is greater than 50, the condition `if (this.requestsHandled > 50)` will be true.\n7. This means that after the 60th call to `handleRequest`, `serverLoad` will be set to 'High'.\n\nThe `simulateActivity` function does not check or change the `serverLoad` directly, but it does ensure that `handleRequest` is called 60 times, which will inevitably make `requestsHandled` exceed 50.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Server Class Logic**:\n   - `handleRequest` increments `requestsHandled` by 1 each time it is called.\n   - If `requestsHandled` exceeds 50, `serverLoad` is set to 'High'.\n\n2. **Database Class Logic**:\n   - `openConnection` increments `connections` by 1 each time it is called.\n   - If `connections` exceeds 100, `dataLoad` is set to 'High' (though this does not affect the serverLoad).\n\n3. **simulateActivity Function**:\n   - Calls `handleRequest` 60 times.\n   - Every 5th call (i.e., when `i % 5 == 0`), it calls `openConnection`.\n\nNow, let's see how many requests the server will handle and how many connections will be opened:\n\n- The loop runs 60 times.\n- For every 5th call, `openConnection` is invoked. So, `openConnection` will be called 12 times (60 / 5 = 12).\n- Therefore, `handleRequest` will be called 60 times.\n\nSince `handleRequest` is called 60 times, `requestsHandled` will be incremented 60 times. This means `requestsHandled` will definitely exceed 50 after the 51st call to `handleRequest`.\n\nGiven that `requestsHandled` will be greater than 50, the condition `if (this.requestsHandled > 50)` will evaluate to true, setting `serverLoad` to 'High'.\n\nTherefore, the serverLoad will indeed become 'High'.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - `server.requestsHandled` starts at 0.\n   - `server.serverLoad` starts as 'Low'.\n\n2. **handleRequest Method**:\n   - Each time `handleRequest` is called, `requestsHandled` increases by 1.\n   - If `requestsHandled` exceeds 50, `serverLoad` changes to 'High'.\n\n3. **simulateActivity Function**:\n   - This function calls `handleRequest` 60 times.\n   - For every 5th call, it also calls `database.openConnection`.\n\n4. **Request Handling Loop**:\n   - The loop runs 60 times.\n   - `handleRequest` is called once per iteration, so `requestsHandled` will increase from 0 to 60.\n\n5. **Check for High Load**:\n   - Since `handleRequest` is called 60 times, `requestsHandled` will be 60 after the loop.\n   - Once `requestsHandled` reaches 51 (or any value greater than 50), `serverLoad` will change to 'High'.\n\nGiven this analysis, the serverLoad will indeed become 'High' after the simulateActivity function completes because `requestsHandled` will exceed 50.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
