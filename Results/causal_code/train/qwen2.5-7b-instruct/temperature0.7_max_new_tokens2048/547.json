  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Applying the '20OFF' coupon code means a discount of 20% of the total amount is taken. As the discount increases the total deductions on the sum of the items (assuming all else remains constant), the final amount payable decreases compared to a scenario with a smaller or no discount.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discount` takes two parameters: `items` (a list of dictionaries with each dictionary containing 'price' and 'quantity') and `coupon_code`.\n\n2. It calculates the total cost of all items first using:\n   ```python\n   total = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n   ```\n\n3. Then it checks the `coupon_code` to determine the discount:\n   - If `coupon_code` is '20OFF', the discount is `total * 0.2`\n   - If `coupon_code` is '10OFF', the discount is `total * 0.1`\n\n4. Finally, it returns the total minus the calculated discount:\n   ```python\n   return total - discount\n   ```\n\n5. For the specific case where the coupon code is '20OFF':\n   - The discount applied would be `total * 0.2`, which is 20% of the total.\n   - This means the final payable amount would be `total - (total * 0.2)`, which simplifies to `total * 0.8`.\n\n6. Since 0.8 (or 80%) is less than 1, applying the '20OFF' coupon effectively reduces the total amount.\n\nTherefore, the final payable amount will indeed decrease when the '20OFF' coupon is applied.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

We are specifically asked about the '20OFF' coupon.\n\nFor the '20OFF' coupon:\n- A 20% discount means the customer pays only 80% of the original total.\n- Mathematically, if the original total is `T`, the payable amount after applying '20OFF' would be `T - (0.2 * T) = 0.8 * T`.\n\nSince 0.8 * T is less than T, the final payable amount will indeed decrease when the '20OFF' coupon is applied.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

We are specifically asked about the '20OFF' coupon code.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when '20OFF' is applied:\n- A 20% discount means 80% of the total price is paid (100% - 20% = 80%).\n- Mathematically, this can be represented as: `total - (total * 0.20)`, which simplifies to `total * 0.80`.\n\nSince 80% is less than 100%, applying the '20OFF' coupon will indeed result in a lower final payable amount compared to the original total price.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
