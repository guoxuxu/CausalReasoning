    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Mutation Rate Definition**: The `mutation_rate` is defined as 0.1 (or 10%).\n\n2. **Random Selection Mechanism**: In the function `mutate_population`, each individual in the population has a chance to be mutated based on the `mutation_rate`. Specifically, for each individual, a random number between 0 and 1 is generated. If this number is less than the `mutation_rate`, the individual is mutated.\n\n3. **Scenario with Mutation Rate of Zero**: If the `mutation_rate` is set to 0, the condition `if random.random() < mutation_rate` will never be true because `random.random()` always returns a value between 0 and 1, which is never less than 0.\n\n4. **Effect on Population**: Since the condition is never met when `mutation_rate` is 0, no individual in the population will be mutated.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: With a mutation rate of 0, there will be no mutated individuals in the population.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

The key point here is that when the mutation rate is 0, the condition `if random.random() < mutation_rate` will never be true because `random.random()` always generates a number between 0 and 1, but never exactly 0.\n\n5. Therefore, no matter how many times the loop runs, the condition will always be false when the mutation rate is 0, and no individuals will be mutated.\n\n6.
