    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The `suggestActivity()` method has three possible outcomes:\n   - \"Stay indoors\"\n   - \"Go skiing\"\n   - \"Go hiking\"\n\n2. For each of these outcomes, there are specific conditions that lead to them:\n   - \"Stay indoors\" is suggested if it is raining.\n   - \"Go skiing\" is suggested if the temperature is below 32 (freezing).\n   - \"Go hiking\" is suggested if neither of the above conditions are met.\n\n3. We need to determine if suggesting \"Stay indoors\" necessarily means it is raining.\n\n4. From the logic:\n   - If it is raining, then \"Stay indoors\" is suggested.\n   - However, \"Stay indoors\" can also be suggested even if it is not raining, specifically when the temperature is below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (freezing).\n\n5.
