    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Algorithm**:\n   - Computes the mean (`mean`) and standard deviation (`std_dev`) of the data.\n   - Normalizes the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.\n   - Sets `alert_flag` to `True` if any normalized value is greater than 2.\n\n2. **Modified Algorithm**:\n   - Computes the mean (`mean`) and standard deviation (`std_dev`) of the data.\n   - Normalizes the data by subtracting three times the standard deviation and dividing by the standard deviation.\n   - Sets `alert_flag` to `True` if any normalized value is greater than 2.\n\n3. **Effect on Alert Flag**:\n   - In the original algorithm, extreme data values that are far from the mean (but not necessarily far from zero) can trigger the alert flag if they are more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean.\n   - In the modified algorithm, extreme data values that are far from the mean will now be shifted further away from zero when three times the standard deviation is subtracted. This means that even values that were within 2 standard deviations of the mean in the original algorithm could now be outside the threshold of 2 after normalization.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the alert flag will indeed be affected by extreme data values under the modified algorithm, but in a different way compared to the original algorithm.
