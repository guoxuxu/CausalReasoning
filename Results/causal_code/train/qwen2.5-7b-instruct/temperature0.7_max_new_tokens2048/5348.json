    "To determine if the `applyDiscount` method being called can be inferred from the `totalCost` slightly decreasing, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the `applyDiscount` Method**:\n   - The `applyDiscount` method takes a `percentage` as input.\n   - It reduces the `totalCost` by that percentage.\n   - Mathematically, it calculates the reduction as `totalCost * percentage / 100` and subtracts it from `totalCost`.\n\n2. **Effect of `applyDiscount` on `totalCost`**:\n   - If `applyDiscount` is called with any non-zero percentage, `totalCost` will definitely decrease.\n   - However, if `applyDiscount` is called with a zero percentage, `totalCost` remains unchanged.\n   - The amount of decrease depends on the percentage applied.\n\n3. **Observing a Slight Decrease in `totalCost`**:\n   - A slight decrease in `totalCost` could occur due to other reasons unrelated to `applyDiscount`.\n   - For example, if the `totalCost` was already at a very low value and then a small price addition followed by a minor subtraction (e.g., due to rounding errors), it might appear as a slight decrease.\n   - Additionally, if multiple items were added and then immediately removed (or their prices slightly adjusted), it could also result in a slight decrease.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - While a slight decrease in `totalCost` strongly suggests that `applyDiscount` might have been called, it cannot be conclusively inferred without further evidence.\n   - Other factors could also cause a slight decrease in `totalCost`.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot definitively infer that `applyDiscount` was called solely based on a slight decrease in `totalCost`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

Other operations could also cause a slight decrease in `totalCost`.\n\n4. **Possible Scenarios**:\n   - If `applyDiscount` was called, then `totalCost` would definitely decrease.\n   - If `totalCost` decreases slightly, it could have been due to `applyDiscount`, but it could also be due to other factors such as rounding errors, small adjustments, or even accidental modifications to `totalCost` outside the `applyDiscount` method.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - A slight decrease in `totalCost` does not provide enough evidence to conclude that `applyDiscount` was the cause.
