    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function Behavior**:\n   - `foo(x)` multiplies `x` by 10 to get `y`.\n   - If `y > 50`, then `z = y + 20`.\n   - If `y ≤ 50`, then `z = y - 20`.\n\n2. **New Function Behavior (always adding 20)**:\n   - We modify the function so that `z = y + 20` for all cases.\n   - This means regardless of whether `y > 50` or `y ≤ 50`, `z` will be `y + 20`.\n\n3. **Effect of Changing `x`**:\n   - When `x` is small (1-5), `y = x * 10` will be between 10 and 50.\n     - In these cases, `z = y + 20`, which means `z` will be between 30 and 70.\n   - When `x` is large (6-10), `y = x * 10` will be between 60 and 100.\n     - In these cases, `z = y + 20`, which means `z` will be between 80 and 120.\n\n4. **Comparison of Results**:\n   - For any given `x`, the new function will produce a higher `z` because `z` is always `y + 20` rather than potentially being `y - 20`.\n   - Since `y` itself increases linearly with `x`, and we are always adding 20 to `y`, higher values of `x` will indeed always result in higher values of `z`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
