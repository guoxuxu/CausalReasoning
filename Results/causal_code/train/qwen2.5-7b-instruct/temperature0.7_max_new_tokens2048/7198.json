We have a causal relationship given: \"Checkout successful with promotion → Promotion applied\"\n   This means that if a promotion is applied during checkout, the message will be \"Checkout successful with promotion\".\n\n2. We need to determine if a promotion has been applied based on the message \"Checkout successful with promotion\".\n\n3. The message \"Checkout successful with promotion\" directly indicates that a promotion was applied during the checkout process.\n\n4.
