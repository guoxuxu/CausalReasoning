    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have an `EnvironmentController` class that regulates temperature based on the current temperature compared to the target temperature.\n\n2. The `regulate_temperature` method reads the current temperature using `temp_sensor.read_temperature()`.\n\n3. If the current temperature is less than the target temperature, it turns on the heater.\n   - This is the condition: `if current_temp < self.target_temp: self.heater.turn_on()`\n\n4. If the current temperature is not less than the target temperature (i.e., it's greater than or equal to the target temperature), it turns on the cooler instead.\n   - This is the alternative condition: `else: self.cooler.turn_on()`\n\n5. The question specifically asks about the case where the heater is turned on.\n\n6.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `regulate_temperature` method is responsible for adjusting the temperature based on the current temperature compared to the target temperature.\n\n2.

We then compare the current temperature (`current_temp`) with the target temperature (`self.target_temp`).\n\n4.

This means that if the heater is turned on, it must be because the current temperature was indeed below the target temperature.\n\n6.
