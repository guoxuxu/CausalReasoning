    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have an `Environment` class that initializes with a given temperature.\n2. The `Environment` class has a condition attribute based on the temperature:\n   - If temperature is 25, condition is 'normal'\n   - Otherwise, condition is 'extreme'\n\n3. We have an `Animal` class that takes an environment as input during initialization.\n4. The `Animal` class has a method `determine_activity()` which determines the activity level based on the environment's condition:\n   - If condition is 'extreme', activity level is 'low'\n   - Otherwise, activity level is 'high'\n\n5. Now, let's consider the scenario where the environment temperature is set to 25:\n   - When `env = Environment(25)` is called, the condition of the environment will be set to 'normal'.\n\n6. Then, when we create an animal with this environment (`animal = Animal(env)`), the `determine_activity()` method is called.\n\n7. Since the environment's condition is 'normal', the `determine_activity()` method will return 'high'.\n\nTherefore, if the environment temperature is set to 25, the animal's activity level will indeed be 'high'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Environment Initialization**:\n   - The `Environment` class is initialized with a `temperature` parameter.\n   - If the `temperature` is 25, the `condition` is set to 'normal'. Otherwise, it's set to 'extreme'.\n\n2. **Animal Initialization**:\n   - The `Animal` class is initialized with an `environment` object.\n   - The `determine_activity` method checks the `condition` of the environment:\n     - If the condition is 'extreme', the activity level is set to 'low'.\n     - If the condition is 'normal', the activity level is set to 'high'.\n\n3. **Scenario with Temperature 25**:\n   - When the temperature is 25, the `condition` of the environment is set to 'normal'.\n   - Therefore, when initializing the `Animal`, the `determine_activity` method will check that the condition is 'normal'.\n   - Since the condition is 'normal', the activity level will be set to 'high'.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if the environment temperature is set to 25, the animal's activity level will indeed be 'high'.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have an `Environment` class that takes a temperature as input.\n2.

Now, let's consider the scenario where the environment temperature is set to 25:\n   - The condition would be set to 'normal' (not 'extreme').\n\n4. Next, we create an `Animal` instance with this environment:\n   - The `Animal` class has a method `determine_activity()`.\n\n5.
