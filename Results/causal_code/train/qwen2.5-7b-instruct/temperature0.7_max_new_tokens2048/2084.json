    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a list of data items as input.\n2. For each data item in the list, it checks the 'temperature' key.\n3. If the temperature is greater than 25, it sets the 'status' key to 'high'.\n4. If the temperature is not greater than 25, it sets the 'status' key to 'normal'.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition in question:\n- We need to determine if the status will invariably be 'high' when the temperature is greater than 25.\n\nLooking at the code:\n- The condition `if data_item['temperature'] > 25:` directly leads to setting `data_item['status'] = 'high'`.\n- There is no other condition or logic that would override this setting.\n\nTherefore, if the temperature of an input data item is indeed greater than 25, the status will be set to 'high' without any exceptions.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
