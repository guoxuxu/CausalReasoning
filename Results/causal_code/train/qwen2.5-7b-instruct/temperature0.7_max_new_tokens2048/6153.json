    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `reset()` method sets both `steps` to 0 and `active` to false.\n2. The `recordSteps(int count)` method adds the specified number of steps to the current `steps` value.\n3. If the updated `steps` value exceeds 10,000, the `active` flag is set to true.\n4. We are asked if recording any number of steps under 10,000 will change the `active` status to true after a reset.\n\nGiven that:\n- A reset operation sets `active` to false.\n- The condition for setting `active` to true is that `steps` must be greater than 10,000.\n\nSince we are only recording steps under 10,000, the `steps` value will never reach or exceed 10,000 after a reset.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthApp` class has a `steps` counter initialized to 0 and an `active` flag initialized to false.\n\n2. The `recordSteps` method is called to add steps to the `steps` counter. If the total steps exceed 10,000, the `active` flag is set to true.\n\n3. A `reset` operation is performed, which sets both `steps` to 0 and `active` to false.\n\n4. Now, we need to determine if recording any number of steps under 10,000 will change the `active` status to true.\n\n5. Since the `active` flag is only set to true when `steps` exceeds 10,000, and the `reset` operation ensures that `steps` is always reset to 0 before any new recording, it follows that recording any number of steps under 10,000 will not change the `active` status to true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
