    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a class `HealthMonitor` with methods to update heart rate and temperature.\n2. The `update_heart_rate` method checks if the new heart rate is greater than 100.\n3. If it is, the method sets the `heart_rate` attribute to the new value and calls the `alert` method with 'high_heart_rate' as the argument.\n4. The `alert` method prints an alert message.\n\nNow, let's look at the code execution:\n\n```python\nmonitor = HealthMonitor()\nmonitor.update_heart_rate(101)\n```\n\n- The initial heart rate is set to 70.\n- `update_heart_rate(101)` is called.\n- Since 101 is greater than 100, the condition `if new_rate > 100` is true.\n- The heart rate is updated to 101.\n- The `alert` method is called with 'high_heart_rate'.\n\nTherefore, when the heart rate is increased to 101 (which is higher than 100), an 'Alert: high_heart_rate' message is indeed printed.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

In the given code, we create an instance of `HealthMonitor` and then call `update_heart_rate(101)`.\n6. Since 101 is indeed greater than 100, the condition in `update_heart_rate` is met.\n7. This triggers the setting of `heart_rate` to 101 and the calling of the `alert` method with 'high_heart_rate'.\n\nTherefore, increasing the heart rate higher than 100 does cause an 'Alert: high_heart_rate' message to be printed.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's break down the code step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthMonitor` class is defined with an `__init__` method that initializes `heart_rate` to 70 and `temperature` to 98.6.\n2. The `update_heart_rate` method checks if the new heart rate is greater than 100.\n3. If it is, the method sets `self.heart_rate` to the new value and calls the `alert` method with the argument 'high_heart_rate'.\n4. If it is not, the method simply sets `self.heart_rate` to the new value without calling the `alert` method.\n\nNow let's look at the specific calls made:\n\n- `monitor.update_heart_rate(101)` is called, which is greater than 100. This will trigger the `alert('high_heart_rate')` call.\n- `monitor.update_temperature(100)` is called, but this does not affect the heart rate alert logic.\n\nGiven this analysis, increasing the heart rate higher than 100 does indeed cause an 'Alert: high_heart_rate' message to be printed.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
