    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1.

To determine if a decrement operation was applied recently, we need to consider the sequence of operations that could lead to a temperature below 10.\n\n4. Possible scenarios leading to a temperature < 10:\n   - Initial temperature was set to < 10 (in the constructor)\n   - Temperature was increased to a value >= 10, then decreased to < 10\n   - Temperature was only decreased from an initial value\n\n5. We cannot definitively say that a decrement operation was the most recent operation just because the temperature is < 10.
