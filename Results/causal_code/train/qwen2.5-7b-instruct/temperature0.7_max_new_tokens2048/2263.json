    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` takes three parameters:\n   - `base_score`: The initial score.\n   - `bonus_points`: Points that may be added to the base score.\n   - `has_bonus`: A boolean indicating whether bonus points should be added.\n\n2. The function checks if `has_bonus` is True:\n   - If True, it adds `bonus_points` to `base_score` to get the `final_score`.\n   - If False, it simply returns `base_score` as the `final_score`.\n\n3. To determine if increasing `base_score` will increase `final_score`, we need to consider both scenarios:\n   - When `has_bonus` is True: Increasing `base_score` will directly result in an increase in `final_score` because `final_score = base_score + bonus_points`.\n   - When `has_bonus` is False: Increasing `base_score` will not change `final_score` because `final_score = base_score`.\n\n4. However, the question asks about the general case \"assuming no change in other variables.\" This means we're considering the effect of changing only `base_score`.\n\n5. In both cases (True and False for `has_bonus`), if `base_score` increases, `final_score` will also increase when `has_bonus` is True.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If `has_bonus` is `True`, the `final_score` is calculated as `base_score + bonus_points`.\n\n3. If `has_bonus` is `False`, the `final_score` remains equal to `base_score`.\n\n4. The question asks if increasing `base_score` will always result in an increase of `final_score`, assuming no change in other variables.\n\n5. Let's consider the scenarios:\n   - If `has_bonus` is `True`, increasing `base_score` will directly lead to an increase in `final_score` because `final_score = base_score + bonus_points`.\n   - If `has_bonus` is `False`, increasing `base_score` will not change `final_score` because `final_score = base_score`.\n\n6. Therefore, whether `final_score` increases depends on the value of `has_bonus`. If `has_bonus` is `True`, increasing `base_score` will indeed increase `final_score`; if `has_bonus` is `False`, it won't.\n\n7. The question specifies \"assuming no change in other variables,\" which means we're only considering changes to `base_score` while keeping `bonus_points` and `has_bonus` constant.\n\n8. Given the above analysis, if `has_bonus` is `True`, increasing `base_score` will increase `final_score`.\n\nHowever, the statement does not specify that `has_bonus` must be `True`. If `has_bonus` can be `False`, then increasing `base_score` would not necessarily increase `final_score`.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the possible values for `has_bonus`, the answer is \"No\".\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

The logic of the function:\n   - If `has_bonus` is True, the final score is calculated as `base_score + bonus_points`.\n   - If `has_bonus` is False, the final score remains just `base_score`.\n\n3. The question asks if increasing `base_score` will also increase `final_score`, assuming no change in other variables.\n\n4.

If `has_bonus` is `True`, the function calculates the `final_score` as `base_score + bonus_points`.\n3.

When `has_bonus` is `True`:\n   - Increasing `base_score` directly results in an increase of `final_score` because `final_score` is calculated as `base_score + bonus_points`. Since `bonus_points` remains unchanged, any increase in `base_score` will lead to a proportional increase in `final_score`.\n\n5. When `has_bonus` is `False`:\n   - Increasing `base_score` does not affect `final_score` because `final_score` is simply equal to `base_score`.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"assuming no change in other variables,\" which implies we are only considering changes to `base_score` and not the value of `has_bonus` or `bonus_points`.\n\nGiven this analysis, if `has_bonus` is `True`, increasing `base_score` will indeed increase `final_score`. If `has_bonus` is `False`, increasing `base_score` will not change `final_score`.\n\nSince the question doesn't specify the state of `has_bonus`, we must consider the general case where `has_bonus` could be either `True` or `False`.
