However, the question specifically asks if the revenue increased at least once by 100 without any sales or discount events. Since the revenue increase of 100 always happens after adding 5 customers (and is tied to the `applyDiscount` method being called when revenue reaches 500), it is always accompanied by a `hasDiscount` event.\n\nTherefore, the revenue did not increase by 100 without any sales or discount events.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
