    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Weather` class has an `__init__` method that takes a temperature parameter.\n2. The `is_rainy` method checks if the temperature is less than 20 degrees and returns `True` if so, otherwise `False`.\n3. The `decide_outfit` function calls `is_rainy` on a `Weather` object and returns 'raincoat' if it's rainy, otherwise 't-shirt'.\n4. Initially, the temperature is set to 18 degrees, which makes the weather not rainy (`False`).\n5. If we change the temperature to 15 degrees, the `Weather` object will be updated with this new temperature.\n6. With a temperature of 15 degrees, the `is_rainy` method will return `True` because 15 is less than 20.\n7. Since `is_rainy` returns `True`, the `decide_outfit` function will return 'raincoat'.\n\nTherefore, if we change the weather in the simulation to rainy by setting the temperature to 15 degrees, a raincoat will indeed be chosen.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the current setup**:\n   - The `Weather` class has an `is_rainy` method that returns `True` if the temperature is less than 20 degrees.\n   - The `decide_outfit` function checks if the weather is rainy and returns 'raincoat' if it is, otherwise it returns 't-shirt'.\n\n2. **Initial scenario**:\n   - The initial temperature is set to 18 degrees.\n   - The `Weather` object `current_weather` is created with this temperature.\n   - The `is_rainy` method of `current_weather` returns `True` because 18 is less than 20.\n   - The `decide_outfit` function then returns 'raincoat' based on the result of `is_rainy`.\n\n3. **Change the scenario**:\n   - We want to check what happens if we change the temperature to 15 degrees.\n   - If the temperature is changed to 15 degrees, the `is_rainy` method will still return `True` because 15 is less than 20.\n   - Therefore, the `decide_outfit` function will still return 'raincoat'.\n\nGiven this reasoning, changing the temperature to 15 degrees will still result in a raincoat being chosen.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
