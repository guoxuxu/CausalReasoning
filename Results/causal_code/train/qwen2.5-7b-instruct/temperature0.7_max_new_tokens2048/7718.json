    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `willItRain()` method has two conditions for returning true:\n   - `isCloudy` must be true\n   - `temperature` must be less than 20\n\n2. If `willItRain()` returns true, it means at least one of these conditions is met.\n\n3. However, the method only returns true if both conditions are satisfied simultaneously.\n\n4. Therefore, if `willItRain()` returns true, we can be certain that `isCloudy` is true because it is a necessary condition for the method to return true.\n\n5. We do need to check the temperature as well, but if the method returns true, we already know `isCloudy` is true regardless of the temperature.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Even though the method also checks the temperature, for `willItRain()` to return true, `isCloudy` must be true as one of the conditions.\n\n5. However, the method does not provide any information about the state of `isCloudy` if the temperature condition is not met. It only explicitly checks `isCloudy` when returning true.\n\n6. Therefore, while `isCloudy` being true is a necessary condition for `willItRain()` to return true, we cannot definitively conclude that `isCloudy` was true based solely on the return value of `willItRain()`, as the method doesn't provide explicit information about `isCloudy` when the temperature condition fails.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
