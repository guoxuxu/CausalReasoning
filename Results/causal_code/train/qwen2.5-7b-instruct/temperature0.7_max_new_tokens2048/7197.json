    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to consider what happens when a 'Book' is added to a cart.\n2. Generally, books have a price associated with them.\n3. When an item is added to a shopping cart, its price is typically included in the total cost of the cart.\n4. Therefore, adding a book to the cart would logically increase the total price, assuming the book has a non-zero price.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that adding a book to the cart will indeed increase the total price.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to consider what typically happens when an item is added to a shopping cart.\n2. Generally, when a book (or any other product) is added to an online shopping cart:\n   - The system calculates the price of the book.\n   - This price is then added to the current total price of items already in the cart.\n3. Assuming there were no items previously in the cart, the addition of the book would be the first item being added.\n4. Therefore, the total price of the cart would increase because it now includes the price of the book.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Generally, when a book (or any other item) is added to a shopping cart, the total price of the cart increases because the item has a cost associated with it.\n3. The cost of the book would be added to the existing total price of items already in the cart.\n4. There are no exceptions mentioned in the question that would negate this typical behavior.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that adding a book to the cart will indeed increase the total price.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the question step by step:\n\n1. We need to consider what happens when a 'Book' is added to the cart.\n2. Generally, adding an item to a cart means that item's price is added to the total price of the cart.\n3. Assuming the book has a positive price (which is standard for books), adding it to the cart would logically increase the total price.\n\nGiven these steps, the logical conclusion is that the total price would indeed increase if a 'Book' is added to the cart.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We need to consider the basic premise of adding an item to a shopping cart.\n2. Generally, when a book (or any item) is added to a shopping cart, it increases the total number of items in the cart.\n3. Assuming the book has a positive price (i.e., it costs money), adding it to the cart would also add its price to the total cost.\n4. Therefore, if we start with a certain total price for the items in the cart and add a book with a positive price, the new total price must be higher than the original total price.\n\nBased on these logical steps, we can conclude that adding a 'Book' to the cart will indeed increase the total price.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"

    "To determine if adding a 'Book' to the cart will increase the total price, let's break down the causal relationship:\n\n1. **Identify the components**: We have a 'Book' and a 'total price'.\n2. **Understand the relationship**: The statement \"Book → total price\" suggests that the presence of a book affects the total price.\n3. **Analyze the effect**: Generally, in most e-commerce scenarios, adding an item (such as a book) to a shopping cart increases the total price because it adds the cost of that item to the existing total.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that adding a 'Book' to the cart will indeed increase the total price.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
