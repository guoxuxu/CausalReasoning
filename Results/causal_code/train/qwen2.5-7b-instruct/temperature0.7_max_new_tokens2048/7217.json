    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `enroll_student` takes two parameters: `students` (a list of student names) and `department_capacity` (an integer representing the maximum number of students that can be enrolled).\n\n2. If the length of the `students` list is greater than `department_capacity`, it returns an empty list.\n\n3. Otherwise, it shuffles the list of students randomly and then selects the first `department_capacity` students from the shuffled list to be enrolled.\n\n4. Increasing the `department_capacity` value directly increases the number of students that can potentially be enrolled.\n\n5. As long as there are enough students in the `students` list to meet or exceed the new `department_capacity`, more students will be enrolled when the capacity is increased.\n\n6. Even if the `students` list is smaller than the new `department_capacity`, the function will still return an empty list, but this is not about increasing the number of enrolled students; rather, it's about the capacity being exceeded.\n\nTherefore, if the department capacity is increased, it will indeed likely increase the number of enrolled students, assuming there are enough students available.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The function checks if the length of the `students` list exceeds the `department_capacity`. If it does, the function returns an empty list because no students can be enrolled.\n\n3. If the `students` list is within the capacity, the function shuffles the list randomly and then selects the first `department_capacity` students from the shuffled list to be enrolled.\n\n4. The key point here is that the number of enrolled students is directly determined by the `department_capacity` parameter. As long as there are enough students in the list to meet or exceed this capacity, all students up to that capacity will be enrolled.\n\n5. Therefore, if the `department_capacity` is increased, assuming there are enough students in the list to meet this new higher capacity, more students will be enrolled.\n\n6. However, if the `department_capacity` is increased but there are not enough students in the list, the number of enrolled students will remain the same or decrease, depending on whether the current number of students is less than or equal to the new capacity.\n\nGiven the general case where there are enough students to meet the new capacity, increasing the department capacity would indeed likely increase the number of enrolled students.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The key point here is that the function enrolls up to `department_capacity` students regardless of how many students are actually in the list as long as it doesn't exceed the capacity.\n\nNow, considering the question:\n- If the department capacity is increased, it means the maximum number of students that can be enrolled at once has increased.\n- However, the function still only enrolls up to `department_capacity` students, even if there are more students available.\n- Therefore, increasing the department capacity does not necessarily increase the number of enrolled students because the enrollment is capped by the function logic.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1.

Conversely, if the new `department_capacity` is smaller or equal to the current one, the number of enrolled students might decrease or stay the same.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that increasing the department capacity will likely increase the number of enrolled students, provided there are enough students available to fill this new capacity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
