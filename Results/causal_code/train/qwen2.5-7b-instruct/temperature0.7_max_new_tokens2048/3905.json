    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discounted_price` takes three parameters: `price`, `discount`, and `is_member`.\n2. If `is_member` is True, the function adds an additional 0.05 to the `discount`.\n3. The `discounted_price` is then calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n4. In the given example:\n   - `price = 100`\n   - `is_member = True`\n   - `received_discount = 0.10`\n5. Since `is_member` is True, the actual discount applied would be `0.10 + 0.05 = 0.15`.\n6. Therefore, the calculated `discounted_price` would be `100 * (1 - 0.15) = 85`.\n\nNow, considering the question:\n\n- If after implementing a policy change that increases discounts, the `discounted_price` decreases significantly across sales data, this could indeed indicate the application of the new policy.\n- However, we need to consider other factors that might also cause a decrease in `discounted_price`, such as changes in the base `price` or changes in how `discount` is calculated.\n\nGiven that the significant decrease in `discounted_price` aligns with the expected behavior after increasing the discount, it strongly suggests the application of the new policy.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discounted_price` takes three parameters: `price`, `discount`, and `is_member`.\n2. If `is_member` is `True`, the function adds an additional 0.05 to the `discount`.\n3. It then calculates the `discounted_price` as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n4. In the provided example:\n   - `price` is set to 100.\n   - `is_member` is set to `True`, so an additional 0.05 is added to `received_discount`.\n   - `received_discount` is initially set to 0.10.\n\nGiven these inputs:\n- The actual `discount` used in the calculation would be `0.10 + 0.05 = 0.15`.\n- Therefore, the `discounted_price` would be `100 * (1 - 0.15) = 100 * 0.85 = 85`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where there is a policy change that increases the discount further. If this policy change results in a significant decrease in `discounted_price` across sales data, it does indeed indicate that the new policy is being applied correctly.\n\nFor instance, if the new policy sets the initial `received_discount` to 0.20 (which is a higher discount), and assuming `is_member` remains `True`, the `discount` would become `0.20 + 0.05 = 0.25`. The new `discounted_price` would then be `100 * (1 - 0.25) = 100 * 0.75 = 75`.\n\nThis significant decrease from 85 to 75 indicates that the new policy is being applied, as expected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function Logic**:\n   - The function `compute_discounted_price` takes three parameters: `price`, `discount`, and `is_member`.\n   - If `is_member` is `True`, it adds an additional 5% to the `discount`.\n   - It then calculates the `discounted_price` as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n\n2. **Given Parameters**:\n   - `price = 100`\n   - `is_member = True`\n   - `received_discount = 0.10`\n\n3. **Calculation with Given Parameters**:\n   - Since `is_member` is `True`, the function will add an additional 5% to `received_discount`, making the total discount `0.15`.\n   - The calculation for `discounted_price` would be `100 * (1 - 0.15) = 100 * 0.85 = 85`.\n\n4. **Policy Change**:\n   - The problem states that there was a policy change to include more discount.\n   - This implies that the new discount rate applied might be higher than `0.15`.\n\n5. **Impact on `discounted_price`**:\n   - If the new policy indeed increases the discount, the `discounted_price` should decrease further from the original calculated value of `85`.\n   - For instance, if the new discount is `0.20` (a common increase in discount), the `discounted_price` would be `100 * (1 - 0.20) = 100 * 0.80 = 80`, which is less than `85`.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - A significant decrease in `discounted_price` across sales data indicates that the application of the new policy has increased the overall discount rate, leading to lower prices.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
