    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_health_index` calculates a base health score starting at 100.\n\n2. There are three factors that can modify this base score:\n   - Age: For every year over 50, the score decreases by 0.75 points.\n   - Diet quality: If the diet quality is less than 3, 20 points are deducted. Otherwise, for each point above 3, 5 points are added.\n   - Exercise frequency: Each unit of exercise frequency adds 10 points to the score.\n\n3. We're specifically asked about the effect of increasing exercise frequency on the health index.\n\n4. According to the code, the only factor that directly increases the base health score is exercise frequency. It adds 10 points for each unit of exercise frequency.\n\nTherefore, if a person increases their exercise frequency, their health index will indeed increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Base Health Score**: The base score is set to 100.\n\n2. **Age Adjustment**:\n   - If age > 50, the score decreases by 0.75 points for each year over 50.\n   - This means that increasing age will decrease the health index, but it does not directly affect the exercise frequency.\n\n3. **Diet Quality**:\n   - If diet quality is less than 3, there is a fixed penalty of 20 points.\n   - If diet quality is 3 or higher, the score increases by 5 points for each unit of diet quality.\n   - Increasing diet quality can potentially increase the health index, but it doesn't directly relate to exercise frequency.\n\n4. **Exercise Frequency**:\n   - The health score increases by 10 points for each unit of exercise frequency.\n   - Therefore, increasing exercise frequency will directly increase the health index.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that increasing exercise frequency will indeed increase the health index.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_health_index` calculates a health score based on three factors: age, diet quality, and exercise frequency.\n\n2. The base health score is set to 100.\n\n3. For each year over 50, the base score decreases by 0.75 points per year.\n4. If the diet quality is less than 3, there's a direct deduction of 20 points from the base score.\n5. If the diet quality is 3 or more, the score increases by 5 points for each unit of diet quality.\n6. The score also increases by 10 points for each unit of exercise frequency.\n\nGiven these rules, we can conclude that increasing the exercise frequency will directly contribute to an increase in the health index because it adds 10 points for each unit of exercise frequency to the base score.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_health_index` takes three parameters: `age`, `diet_quality`, and `exercise_frequency`.\n\n2. The base health score is set to 100.\n\n3. There are conditional adjustments to the base health score based on the input values:\n   - If the person's age is greater than 50, the score decreases by 0.75 points for each year over 50.\n   - If the diet quality is less than 3, 20 points are deducted from the score.\n   - If the diet quality is 3 or higher, the score increases by 5 points for each point of diet quality.\n   - The score increases by 10 points for each unit increase in exercise frequency.\n\n4. The question specifically asks about the effect of increasing exercise frequency on the health index.\n\n5. From the logic provided in the function, we can see that there is a direct positive relationship between exercise frequency and the health index. Specifically, for every unit increase in exercise frequency, the health score increases by 10 points.\n\nTherefore, if a person increases their exercise frequency, their health index will indeed increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
