    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `compute_income` function calculates the total income based on the following logic:\n   - If `hours_worked` is greater than 40:\n     - Calculate `extra_hours` as `hours_worked - 40`.\n     - Calculate `extra_pay` as `extra_hours * (salary * 0.5)`.\n     - Calculate `total_income` as `(salary * hours_worked) + extra_pay * rate_increase`.\n\n2. When `hours_worked > 40`, the formula for `total_income` includes a term that depends on `rate_increase`:\n   - `extra_pay * rate_increase`\n\n3. The `extra_pay` itself is already dependent on the `salary`:\n   - `extra_pay = extra_hours * (salary * 0.5)`\n\n4. Therefore, any increase in `rate_increase` directly multiplies the `extra_pay` component of the total income.\n\n5. Since the `total_income` calculation explicitly includes `rate_increase` in the `extra_pay` component, an increase in `rate_increase` will indeed result in an increase in `total_income` when `hours_worked > 40`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the `compute_income` function step by step to determine if an increase in `rate_increase` will lead to an increase in `total_income` when `hours_worked > 40`.\n\n1. **Condition Check**: The function first checks if `hours_worked > 40`.\n2. **Extra Hours Calculation**: If true, it calculates `extra_hours` as `hours_worked - 40`.\n3. **Extra Pay Calculation**: It then calculates `extra_pay` as `extra_hours * (salary * 0.5)`. This means for each extra hour beyond 40, the pay is half of the regular hourly rate.\n4. **Total Income Calculation**:\n   - If `hours_worked > 40`, the total income is calculated as `(salary * hours_worked) + extra_pay * rate_increase`.\n   - If `hours_worked <= 40`, the total income is simply `salary * hours_worked`.\n\nGiven that we are focusing on the scenario where `hours_worked > 40`, let's look at the formula for `total_income`:\n\n\\[ \\text{total\\_income} = (\\text{salary} \\times \\text{hours\\_worked}) + (\\text{extra\\_hours} \\times (\\text{salary} \\times 0.5)) \\times \\text{rate\\_increase} \\]\n\n- The term \\((\\text{salary} \\times \\text{hours\\_worked})\\) is the base income.\n- The term \\((\\text{extra\\_hours} \\times (\\text{salary} \\times 0.5)) \\times \\text{rate\\_increase}\\) includes the extra pay multiplied by the `rate_increase`.\n\nSince `rate_increase` is a multiplier applied to the extra pay, any increase in `rate_increase` will directly result in an increase in the extra pay component of the total income.\n\nTherefore, if `hours_worked > 40`, an increase in `rate_increase` will indeed cause an increase in `total_income`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `compute_income` function to understand how the `total_income` is calculated based on the parameters provided:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If `hours_worked` is less than or equal to 40:\n   - The total income is simply the product of `salary` and `hours_worked`.\n\n2. **Extra Hours Case**: If `hours_worked` is greater than 40:\n   - `extra_hours` = `hours_worked - 40`\n   - `extra_pay` = `extra_hours * (salary * 0.5)`\n   - `total_income` = `(salary * hours_worked) + extra_pay * rate_increase`\n\nGiven this, let's analyze how an increase in `rate_increase` affects the `total_income` when `hours_worked > 40`:\n\n- The base salary and regular working hours contribute to the total income as usual.\n- The extra pay for the additional hours (`extra_hours * (salary * 0.5)`) remains constant regardless of the `rate_increase`.\n- The term `extra_pay * rate_increase` is directly proportional to `rate_increase`. This means that if `rate_increase` increases, the extra pay component of the total income will also increase.\n\nTherefore, given that `hours_worked > 40`, an increase in `rate_increase` will indeed result in an increase in `total_income`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
