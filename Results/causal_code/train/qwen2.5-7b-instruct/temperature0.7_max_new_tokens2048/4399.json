  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Calling setWaterSupply(true) sets the waterSupply variable to true. The conditional inside the setWaterSupply function checks if the status is true, and thus triggers the alertSystem with the message 'Water supply restored.'.",
  "causal_map": "setWaterSupply(true) → alertSystem('Water supply restored.')",
  "causal_map_integration": "Calling setWaterSupply(true) will trigger the alertSystem('Water supply restored.') method.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `setWaterSupply` method is called with the argument `true`.\n2.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `PlantManager` class has a private boolean variable `waterSupply`.\n\n2.

Inside the `setWaterSupply` method, there's an `if-else` statement that checks the value of `status`:\n   - If `status` is true, it calls `alertSystem('Water supply restored.')`.\n   - If `status` is false, it calls `alertSystem('Water supply cut off.')`.\n\n4.
