  "Explanation": "While an increase in visits generally implies an increase in sales, a significant jump in sales can also be caused by activating a promotion, which doubles the sales increment per visit. Thus, sales can increase significantly either due to more visits or due to the effect of promotion, not definitively one or the other.",

    "Let's analyze the provided code step by step:\n\n1. **Class Structure**: The `ECommerceSystem` class contains three attributes:\n   - `sales`: Tracks the total sales.\n   - `visits`: Tracks the total number of visits.\n   - `promotionActive`: A boolean flag indicating whether a promotion is active.\n\n2. **updateSystemStatistics Method**:\n   - This method updates both `sales` and `visits` based on the `newVisits` parameter.\n   - If `promotionActive` is `true`, each visit contributes twice to the sales.\n   - If `promotionActive` is `false`, each visit contributes once to the sales.\n\n3. **activatePromotion and deactivatePromotion Methods**:\n   - These methods simply toggle the `promotionActive` flag between `true` and `false`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the `sales` number increases significantly:\n\n- **Sales Increase Due to Promotion**: If the promotion is active (`promotionActive == true`), then each visit contributes twice to the sales. Therefore, a significant increase in sales could be due to an increase in visits, especially if the promotion is driving more traffic.\n- **Sales Increase Without Promotion**: If the promotion is not active (`promotionActive == false`), then each visit contributes only once to the sales. In this case, a significant increase in sales would directly correspond to an increase in visits.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the significant increase in sales could also be due to other factors such as:\n- Increased conversion rate (i.e., more visitors making purchases).\n- Changes in product prices or discounts.\n- Seasonal trends affecting customer behavior.\n\nGiven these points, while a significant increase in sales might indicate an increase in visits, we cannot definitively infer that the number of visits has increased without additional context about the state of `promotionActive` and other potential influencing factors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The `updateSystemStatistics` method updates the `sales` and `visits` based on the `newVisits` parameter.\n2. If `promotionActive` is true, each visit results in two sales.\n3. If `promotionActive` is false, each visit results in one sale.\n4. The `deactivatePromotion` and `activatePromotion` methods simply toggle the `promotionActive` flag.\n\nGiven these rules:\n- If there's no promotion (`promotionActive = false`), each visit directly contributes to one sale.\n- If there's a promotion (`promotionActive = true`), each visit contributes to two sales.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `sales` increase significantly:\n- This could be due to an increase in visits.\n- However, it could also be due to the activation of a promotion, which would double the contribution of each visit to sales without necessarily increasing the number of visits.\n\nTherefore, a significant increase in sales does not definitively imply a significant increase in visits; it could be due to a promotion.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
