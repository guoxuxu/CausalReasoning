    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `complex_computation(x)` takes an input `x` and performs a series of operations to compute `result`.\n\n2. First, it calculates `y = x * 2`. This means `y` is directly proportional to `x`.\n\n3. Then, it calculates `z = y + 3`, which can be rewritten as `z = (x * 2) + 3`. Again, this shows that `z` is directly related to `x`.\n\n4. The key decision point is the `if` statement:\n   - If `z > 10`, then `result = z - 5`.\n   - Otherwise, `result = z + 5`.\n\n5. Let's analyze the two cases:\n   - When `z > 10`: \n     - `result = z - 5`\n     - Since `z = (x * 2) + 3`, for large enough `x`, `z` will indeed be greater than 10.\n   - When `z <= 10`:\n     - `result = z + 5`\n     - Here, `result` is `z + 5`, which is still directly dependent on `x`.\n\n6. To determine if `result` definitely increases with `x`, we need to consider both scenarios:\n   - In the case where `z > 10`, increasing `x` will increase `z`, and thus `result = z - 5` will also increase because `z` is increasing.\n   - In the case where `z <= 10`, increasing `x` will increase `z`, and thus `result = z + 5` will also increase.\n\n7. Therefore, in both cases, as `x` increases, `result` will definitely increase.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's analyze the function `complex_computation(x)` step by step to determine if the result will definitely increase as x increases.\n\n1. **Initial Computation**:\n   - `y = x * 2`\n   - `z = y + 3` which can be rewritten as `z = (x * 2) + 3`\n\n2. **Conditional Check**:\n   - The condition `if z > 10:` checks whether `(x * 2) + 3 > 10`.\n\n3. **Result Calculation**:\n   - If `z > 10`, then `result = z - 5`.\n   - If `z <= 10`, then `result = z + 5`.\n\nNow let's consider how the result changes with increasing x:\n\n- **Case 1**: When `x` is such that `z > 10`\n  - `result = z - 5`\n  - As `x` increases, both `y` and `z` increase linearly.\n  - Since `z = (x * 2) + 3`, when `x` increases, `z` also increases, and thus `result = z - 5` will increase.\n\n- **Case 2**: When `x` is such that `z <= 10`\n  - `result = z + 5`\n  - Again, as `x` increases, `z` increases because `z = (x * 2) + 3`.\n  - Since `z + 5` is an increasing function of `z`, `result` will also increase as `x` increases.\n\nIn both cases, we see that as `x` increases, the value of `result` also increases.
