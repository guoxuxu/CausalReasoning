    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` sets the `status` of the input data to 'adult' if the age is greater than 20.\n2.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` sets the `status` of the input data to either 'adult' or 'young' based on the age condition.\n2.
