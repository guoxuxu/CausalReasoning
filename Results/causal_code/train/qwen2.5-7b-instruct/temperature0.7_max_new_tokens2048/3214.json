    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `foo` takes an input `x`.\n2. It multiplies `x` by 10 to get `y`.\n3. If `y > 50`, it adds 20 to `y` to get `z`.\n4. If `y <= 50`, it subtracts 20 from `y` to get `z`.\n\nNow, let's consider how increasing `x` affects `z`:\n\n1. If `x` is less than 6 (since 6 * 10 = 60), then `y` will be less than or equal to 50.\n   - In this case, increasing `x` will decrease `y` (because `y = x * 10`), and since we subtract 20 from `y`, `z` will also decrease.\n\n2.

If `y` is not greater than 50, `z` is calculated as `y - 20`.\n\nNow, let's consider how changes in `x` affect `z`:\n\n- When `x` is small (1 to 5):\n  - `y = x * 10` ranges from 10 to 50.\n  - Since `y` is not greater than 50, `z = y - 20`.\n  - As `x` increases, `y` increases linearly, but `z` decreases because we are subtracting 20.\n\n- When `x` is large (6 to 10):\n  - `y = x * 10` ranges from 60 to 100.\n  - Since `y` is greater than 50, `z = y + 20`.\n  - As `x` increases, `y` increases linearly, and so does `z`.\n\nSo, for `x` values from 1 to 5, increasing `x` results in a decrease in `z`.

At this point, the behavior changes from `z = y - 20` to `z = y + 20`.\n\nTherefore, for values of `x` that keep `y` below 50, increasing `x` will decrease `z`.
