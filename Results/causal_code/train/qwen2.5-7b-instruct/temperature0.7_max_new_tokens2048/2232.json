    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The Human class has a method `check_comfort` that determines if the person feels comfortable based on the current temperature.\n\n2. The `check_comfort` method returns True if the temperature is between 22°C and 28°C (inclusive).\n\n3. If the `check_comfort` method returns False, it means the person does not feel comfortable, implying they are either too cold or too hot.\n\n4. The `adjust_heat` method is called when the person doesn't feel comfortable. This method checks if the person feels cold or hot and then calls either `increase_heat` or `decrease_heat` on the environment.\n\n5. The `feel_cold` and `feel_hot` methods directly return whether the temperature is below 22°C or above 28°C, respectively.\n\n6. Therefore, if a human feels uncomfortable (not within the 22-28°C range), the temperature must be either below 22°C or above 28°C.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that a feeling of discomfort in humans does indeed imply that the temperature is outside the 22-28°C range.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The environment starts at 25°C.\n2. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `environment.temperature` affects `Human.comfortable`.\n   - If `Human.feel_cold()` returns `True`, then `Human.comfortable` is `False`.\n   - If `Human.feel_hot()` returns `True`, then `Human.comfortable` is `False`.\n3. **Comfort Check**:\n   - `Human.comfortable` is initially checked based on the current temperature.\n   - If the temperature is not within 22-28°C, `Human.comfortable` will be `False`.\n4. **Adjust Heat**:\n   - If `Human.comfortable` is `False`, the human will attempt to adjust the heat:\n     - If the temperature is below 22°C, it will call `environment.increase_heat()`.\n     - If the temperature is above 28°C, it will call `environment.decrease_heat()`.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that if a human feels cold or hot (i.e., `feel_cold()` or `feel_hot()` returns `True`), it implies that the temperature is outside the 22-28°C range.
