  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Rain occurs if the humidity is above 50 and a random boolean is true. High humidity can result either from temperature being above 25 degrees or less, as the set 40% humidity can still cross 50 given random factors and other uncontrolled aspects in practical scenarios. Thus, rain is not solely dependent on high temperatures.",
  "causal_map": "temperature > 25 → humidity; humidity > 50 → isRaining",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature is above 25 degrees, then the humidity will be high (80%), which increases the likelihood of rain. However, rain can also occur if the humidity is above 50% regardless of the temperature.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `simulateWeather` method generates weather conditions based on a seed value.\n2. The temperature is set to a random integer between 10 and 29 (inclusive).\n3. The humidity is determined based on the temperature:\n   - If temperature > 25, humidity is set to 80.\n   - Otherwise, humidity is set to 40.\n4. It will rain if:\n   - The humidity is greater than 50 AND\n   - A random boolean value generated by `rand.nextBoolean()` is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition for rain:\n- For rain to occur, the humidity must be > 50.\n- Based on the temperature rule, humidity can only be 80 if the temperature is > 25.\n- However, humidity can also be 40 if the temperature is ≤ 25, which means it could still rain even if the temperature is not > 25.\n\nTherefore, just because it is observed that it is raining does not necessarily mean the temperature was above 25 degrees.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

For it to rain, `humidity` must be greater than 50.\n2. If `temperature <= 25`, `humidity` will be set to 40, which is not greater than 50.\n3.
