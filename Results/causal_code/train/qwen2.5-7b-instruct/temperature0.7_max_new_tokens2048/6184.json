    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Calculator` class has two integer variables `a` and `b`.\n\n2. The `sum()` method simply returns the value of `a + b`.\n\n3. We are told that `sum()` returns 20. This means:\n   a + b = 20\n\n4. We need to determine if `a` and `b` could both be 10.\n\n5. If `a` and `b` were both 10, then:\n   a + b = 10 + 10 = 20\n\n6. While it is true that `a` and `b` could both be 10 to satisfy the equation `a + b = 20`, there are other possible combinations as well. For example:\n   - a = 15, b = 5\n   - a = 9, b = 11\n   - a = 20, b = 0\n   - etc.\n\n7.
