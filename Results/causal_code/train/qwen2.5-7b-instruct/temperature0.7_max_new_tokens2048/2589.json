    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **System Overload Check**:\n   - The `is_system_overloaded` method checks two conditions:\n     - If `temperature > 100` or `cpu_usage > 90`, it returns `True`.\n     - Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n2. **Cooling Required Check**:\n   - The `cooling_required` method first checks if the system is overloaded using `is_system_overloaded`.\n   - If the system is not overloaded, it then checks if `temperature > 80`.\n   - If either of these conditions is met, it returns `True`.\n   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n3. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if the `is_system_overloaded` method will still return `True` when the CPU usage is at 95 and the temperature is reduced below 80 with external cooling.\n\n4. **Conditions for `is_system_overloaded`**:\n   - The method will return `True` if either:\n     - `temperature > 100`\n     - `cpu_usage > 90`\n\n5. **Given Conditions**:\n   - Temperature is reduced below 80.\n   - CPU usage is at 95.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the temperature is now below 100, the condition `temperature > 100` is not met.\n   - The condition `cpu_usage > 90` (which is 95) is met.\n   - Therefore, `is_system_overloaded` will return `True` based on the CPU usage alone.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `is_system_overloaded` and `cooling_required` methods to understand how they work:\n\n1. **`is_system_overloaded` Method:**\n   - It checks two conditions:\n     1. If the `temperature` is greater than 100.\n     2. If the `cpu_usage` is greater than 90.\n   - If either condition is true, it returns `True`, indicating the system is overloaded.\n\n2. **`cooling_required` Method:**\n   - It first checks if the system is overloaded using the `is_system_overloaded` method.\n   - If the system is not overloaded, it then checks if the `temperature` is greater than 80.\n   - If either condition (system is overloaded or temperature > 80) is true, it returns `True`, indicating that cooling is required.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where external cooling reduces the temperature below 80 but the CPU usage is at 95.\n\n- The `is_system_overloaded` method will check the `cpu_usage` condition first because the temperature is now below 80.\n- Since the `cpu_usage` is 95, which is greater than 90, the `is_system_overloaded` method will return `True`.\n\nTherefore, even though the temperature is reduced below 80, the `is_system_overloaded` method will still return `True` due to the high CPU usage.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The `cooling_required` method:\n   - First checks if `is_system_overloaded()` is True.\n   - If not, it then checks if the temperature is > 80.\n\n4. We're asked about a scenario where external cooling reduces the temperature to below 80, but the CPU usage is at 95.\n\n5. In this scenario:\n   - The temperature condition would be False because it's below 80.\n   - The CPU usage is 95, which meets the second condition for `is_system_overloaded`.\n\n6.

Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n2. **Cooling Required Check**:\n   - This method first calls `is_system_overloaded`.\n   - If `is_system_overloaded` returns `True`, it immediately returns `True` without further checks.\n   - If `is_system_overloaded` returns `False`, it then checks if the temperature is greater than 80.\n   - If the temperature is greater than 80, it returns `True`.
