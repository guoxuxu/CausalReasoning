If we manually set the discount to 20% for any season, regardless of the actual season, the discount will always be 20%.\n\n3. The `calculateFinalPrice` method subtracts the discount from the original price.\n\n4. Let's calculate the final price for each season with a manual 20% discount:\n   - Season 1 (Winter): \n     - Discount: 20% of 500 = 100\n     - Final Price: 500 - 100 = 400\n   - Season 2:\n     - Discount: 20% of 500 = 100\n     - Final Price: 500 - 100 = 400\n   - Season 3:\n     - Discount: 20% of 500 = 100\n     - Final Price: 500 - 100 = 400\n   - Default (Season 4):\n     - Discount: 20% of 500 = 100\n     - Final Price: 500 - 100 = 400\n\n5.

If we manually set the discount to 20% for any season, the discount calculation would always be 20%, regardless of the actual season.\n\n3. Now, let's consider how the final price is calculated:\n   - Final Price = Product Price - Discount\n\n4. If the discount is set to 20% manually, then:\n   - For any season, the discount will be 20% of the product price.\n   - Therefore, the final price will be 80% of the original price (100% - 20%).\n\n5. Let's verify with an example:\n   - Original Price = 500\n   - Manual Discount = 20%\n   - Final Price = 500 - (500 * 20 / 100) = 500 - 100 = 400\n\n6.
