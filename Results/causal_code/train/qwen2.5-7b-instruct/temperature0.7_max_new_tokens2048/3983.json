    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` takes three parameters: `grade`, `bonus`, and `isMember`.\n\n2. If `isMember` is `True`, the final score is calculated as `grade + bonus + 20`.\n\n3. If `isMember` is `False`, the final score is calculated as `grade + bonus`.\n\n4. In the provided code:\n   - `membership_status` is set to `True`.\n   - `basic_grade` is set to `85`.\n   - `additional_bonus` is set to `15`.\n   - The function is called with these values.\n\n5. Since `isMember` is `True`, the final score will be `85 + 15 + 20 = 120`.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"Can observing a change in 'final_score' indicate a change in 'isMember' status?\"\n\n- The `final_score` calculation directly depends on the value of `isMember`.\n- If `isMember` changes from `True` to `False`, the final score would change because the constant `20` would no longer be added.\n- Conversely, if `isMember` changes from `False` to `True`, the final score would also change due to the addition of the `20`.\n\nTherefore, a change in `final_score` can indeed indicate a change in `isMember` status.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `compute_final_score` function takes three parameters: `grade`, `bonus`, and `isMember`.\n\n2. The function checks if `isMember` is `True`. If it is:\n   - It adds 20 to the sum of `grade` and `bonus`.\n   - Otherwise, it just adds `bonus` to `grade`.\n\n3. The `isMember` variable is explicitly passed into the function as `True` in the invocation.\n\n4. Changing the value of `final_score` would not affect the value of `isMember` because `final_score` is calculated based on the values of `grade`, `bonus`, and `isMember`, but it does not modify `isMember`.\n\n5. Since `isMember` is set to `True` and remains unchanged within the function (as no code inside modifies it), any observed change in `final_score` cannot be attributed to a change in `isMember`.\n\nTherefore, observing a change in `final_score` cannot indicate a change in `isMember` status.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` takes three parameters: `grade`, `bonus`, and `isMember`.\n\n2. The logic inside the function:\n   - If `isMember` is True, it adds an extra 20 to the final score.\n   - If `isMember` is False, it doesn't add the extra 20.\n\n3. We are given specific values:\n   - `membership_status = True`\n   - `basic_grade = 85`\n   - `additional_bonus = 15`\n\n4. Let's calculate the `final_score` with these values:\n   - Since `isMember` is True, the calculation will be: `final_score = 85 + 15 + 20 = 120`\n\n5. Now, let's consider what would happen if we changed `isMember` to False:\n   - The calculation would be: `final_score = 85 + 15 = 100`\n\n6. Comparing the two results:\n   - With `isMember = True`: `final_score = 120`\n   - With `isMember = False`: `final_score = 100`\n\n7. We can see that changing the `isMember` status from True to False does indeed result in a different `final_score`.\n\nTherefore, observing a change in `final_score` can indicate a change in the `isMember` status.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
