    "Let's break down the logic of the methods to determine if 'processData' will definitely return true after calling 'updateData' with a positive integer.\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - `data` is initialized to an integer value.\n   - `status` is initially set to `false`.\n\n2. **Calling `updateData` with a Positive Integer**:\n   - The `updateData` method checks if the `newData` is greater than 0.\n   - If it is, both `data` and `status` are updated:\n     - `data` is set to `newData`.\n     - `status` is set to `true`.\n\n3. **Subsequent Call to `processData`**:\n   - The `processData` method checks the current `status`.\n   - If `status` is `true`, it increments `data` by 10 and returns `true`.\n   - If `status` is `false`, it returns `false`.\n\nGiven these steps:\n\n- If we call `updateData` with a positive integer, `status` will be set to `true`.\n- On the next call to `processData`, since `status` is `true`, `processData` will increment `data` by 10 and return `true`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `DataProcessor` class is initialized with an `int` value for `data` and a `boolean` value for `status`. Initially, `status` is set to `false`.\n\n2. **updateData Method**:\n   - If a positive integer is passed to `updateData`, it updates `data` to the new value.\n   - It then sets `status` to `true`.\n   - If a non-positive integer is passed, it only sets `status` to `false`.\n\n3. **processData Method**:\n   - This method checks the `status`.\n   - If `status` is `true`, it increments `data` by 10 and returns `true`.\n   - If `status` is `false`, it returns `false`.\n\n4. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - For `processData()` to return `true`, `status` must be `true`.\n   - `status` becomes `true` only when a positive integer is passed to `updateData()`.\n\nTherefore, if `updateData` is called with a positive integer, `status` will be set to `true`, and `processData` will definitely return `true` on the subsequent call.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The `processData` method checks the `status`:\n   - If `status` is `true`, it increments `data` by 10 and returns `true`\n   - If `status` is `false`, it returns `false`\n\nGiven these points, let's consider what happens when we call `updateData` with a positive integer:\n- `data` is updated to the new value.\n- `status` is set to `true`.\n\nWhen we then call `processData`:\n- Since `status` was set to `true` by `updateData`, `processData` will execute the block where it increments `data` by 10 and returns `true`.\n\nTherefore, if `updateData` is called with a positive integer, `processData` will indeed return `true` on the subsequent call.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
