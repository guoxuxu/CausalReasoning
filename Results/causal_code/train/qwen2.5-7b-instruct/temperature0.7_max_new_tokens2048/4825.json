    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Function**: \n   - `compute_scores` takes two parameters: `data` (a list of lists with numeric values) and `weights` (a list of numeric weights).\n   - It computes the weighted sum for each sub-list in `data` using the corresponding weights.\n\n2. **Weight Calculation**:\n   - For each sub-list `item` in `data`, it performs a weighted sum calculation: `sum(d * w for d, w in zip(item, weights))`.\n   - This means that each element `d` in `item` is multiplied by its corresponding weight `w`.\n\n3. **Effect of Setting Weights to Zero**:\n   - If we set all weights to zero (`weights = [0, 0]`), then the expression inside the sum becomes `d * 0` for every element `d` in `item`.\n   - Any number multiplied by zero results in zero.\n\n4. **Resulting Scores**:\n   - Given that all weights are zero, the weighted sum for any sub-list will be zero.\n   - Therefore, no matter what the values in `data` are, if all weights are zero, the resulting scores will all be zero.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since all weights are zero, no non-zero data items in `data` will contribute to the scores because they will all be multiplied by zero.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Function Understanding**: The function `compute_scores` takes `data` and `weights` as inputs.\n   - `data` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains numeric data points.\n   - `weights` is a list of numeric weights.\n\n2. **Calculation Process**:\n   - For each sublist in `data`, the function multiplies each element by its corresponding weight.\n   - It then sums these products to get a score for that sublist.\n\n3. **Effect of Setting Weights to Zero**:\n   - If we set all weights to zero (`weights = [0, 0]`), the calculation inside the function will be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{score} = \\sum (\\text{d} \\times \\text{w}) = \\sum (0) = 0\n     \\]\n   - This means no matter what values are in the `data` sublists, when multiplied by zero, the result will always be zero.\n\n4. **Non-Zero Data Items**:\n   - Even if there are non-zero values in the `data` sublists, multiplying them by zero will result in zero.\n   - Therefore, any non-zero data items will not contribute to the scores because they will all become zero after the multiplication.\n\nGiven this reasoning, non-zero data items in `data` will not contribute to the scores if all weights are set to zero.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
