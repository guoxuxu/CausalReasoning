    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**:\n   - `process_data` takes two arguments: `data` (a list of dictionaries with each dictionary containing a 'score' key) and `filter_threshold` (default is 10).\n   - It filters the data to include only those items where the 'score' is greater than `filter_threshold`.\n   - It then calculates the average score of the filtered data.\n\n2. **Given Data**:\n   - The provided data has scores ranging from 5 to 22.\n   - The `filter_threshold` is set to 12 in the example call to the function.\n\n3. **Filtering Process**:\n   - With a threshold of 12, only items with scores greater than 12 will be included in `filtered_data`.\n   - From the given data, these items are: `{'score': 15}` and `{'score': 22}`.\n\n4. **Average Score Calculation**:\n   - The average score is calculated as `(15 + 22) / 2 = 18.5`.\n\n5. **Analyzing the Question**:\n   - The question asks if a low 'average_score' can suggest that the 'filter_threshold' was set too high.\n   - If the 'filter_threshold' were higher, fewer items would pass the filter, potentially leading to an even smaller dataset for calculating the average score.\n   - Conversely, if the 'filter_threshold' were lower, more items would pass the filter, possibly including items with lower scores, which could bring down the average score.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - A low 'average_score' can indeed suggest that the 'filter_threshold' was set too high because it implies that not many items passed the filter, and those that did had relatively high scores.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
