    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `update_temperature` takes two parameters: `ambient_temp` (the current temperature) and `heater_on` (a boolean indicating whether the heater is on).\n\n2. If `heater_on` is true, the function returns `ambient_temp + 5`. This means that if the heater is forced to be true, the temperature will increase by 5 degrees.\n\n3. If `heater_on` is false, the function returns `ambient_temp - 1`. However, the question specifically asks what happens when `heater_on` is forced to be true.\n\n4. Therefore, when `heater_on` is true, the `update_temperature` function will indeed show an increase in temperature.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
