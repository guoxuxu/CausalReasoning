  "Explanation": "From cause to effect without intervention: Increasing the base_score directly increases the adjusted_score, which is positively proportional to the final_score. As there are no changes in the other parameters (has_bonus, penalty, score_multiplier), increasing the base_score will result in a higher final_score.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` takes four parameters:\n   - `base_score`: The initial score.\n   - `has_bonus`: A boolean indicating whether a bonus is applied.\n   - `penalty`: A value subtracted from the adjusted score.\n   - `score_multiplier`: A value that multiplies the adjusted score.\n\n2. If `has_bonus` is True, the bonus is set to 20; otherwise, it's 0.\n\n3. The `adjusted_score` is calculated as:\n   - `base_score + bonus - penalty`\n\n4. The `final_score` is then computed as:\n   - `adjusted_score * score_multiplier`\n\n5. Now, let's consider what happens when the `base_score` increases:\n   - The `bonus` remains unchanged (either 0 or 20).\n   - The `penalty` remains unchanged.\n   - The `score_multiplier` remains unchanged.\n\n6. Since only the `base_score` is changing, and it is added directly to the `adjusted_score`, an increase in `base_score` will result in an increase in `adjusted_score`.\n\n7. An increase in `adjusted_score` will result in an increase in `final_score`, because `final_score` is simply the `adjusted_score` multiplied by a constant (`score_multiplier`).\n\nTherefore, with no changes in other parameters, an increase in `base_score` will definitely lead to an increase in `final_score`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
