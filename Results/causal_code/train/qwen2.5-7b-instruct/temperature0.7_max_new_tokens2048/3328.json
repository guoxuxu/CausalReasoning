    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_sales_data` calculates the total sales, then calculates the total tax based on the given tax rate, and finally computes the final revenue as the sum of total sales and total tax.\n\n2. If `tax_percentage` is set to zero, the calculation for `total_tax` would be:\n   - `total_tax = total_sales * 0.00` (since `tax_percentage = 0.05` but we're considering the scenario where it's zero)\n\n3.
