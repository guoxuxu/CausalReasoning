    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `weather_condition()` function generates a random choice between 'sunny', 'rainy', and 'cloudy'.\n\n2. The `decide_picnic(weather)` function takes the weather as input and returns:\n   - 'go' if the weather is 'sunny'\n   - 'cancel' if the weather is 'rainy'\n   - 'wait' if the weather is 'cloudy'\n\n3. In the main code:\n   - `weather_today` is assigned the result of `weather_condition()`\n   - `picnic_decision` is then set to the result of calling `decide_picnic(weather_today)`\n\n4. If the weather is 'sunny':\n   - `weather_today` will be 'sunny'\n   - `decide_picnic('sunny')` will return 'go'\n\n5. However, the question asks if the picnic will definitely happen if it is sunny.\n   - While the function does return 'go' for 'sunny' weather, the term 'go' in this context doesn't necessarily mean the picnic will definitely happen. It just means the decision is to proceed with the picnic plan.\n\n6. There's still a possibility that external factors or other considerations could prevent the picnic from happening even if the weather is 'sunny'.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logic of the functions, we cannot definitively say the picnic will happen just because it's sunny.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `weather_condition()` function randomly selects from three options: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2.

The variable `picnic_decision` is set to the result of calling `decide_picnic(weather_today)`. Given that `weather_today` can be any of the three outcomes, we need to consider each case:\n   - If `weather_today` is 'sunny', `picnic_decision` will be 'go'.\n   - If `weather_today` is 'rainy', `picnic_decision` will be 'cancel'.\n   - If `weather_today` is 'cloudy', `picnic_decision` will be 'wait'.\n\n5.

For the picnic to definitely happen, `picnic_decision` must always return 'go' when `weather_today` is 'sunny'.\n\n6.
