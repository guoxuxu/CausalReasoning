    "Let's break down the logic of the `sales_prediction` function to determine if sales will definitely increase when a promotion is introduced at temperatures above 20 degrees.\n\n1. **Base Sales**: The base sales value is set to 100.\n2. **Temperature Check**:\n   - If the temperature is greater than 20:\n     - If promotion is active, sales = base_sales + 50.\n     - If promotion is not active, sales = base_sales + 20.\n   - If the temperature is 20 or below:\n     - If promotion is active, sales = base_sales + 30.\n     - If promotion is not active, sales = base_sales.\n\nNow, let's focus on the scenario where the temperature is above 20 degrees and there is a promotion:\n\n- When temperature > 20 and promotion_active:\n  - The function sets `sales = base_sales + 50`, which means sales increase by 50 from the base sales.\n\n- When temperature > 20 but promotion_active is False:\n  - The function sets `sales = base_sales + 20`, which still represents an increase from the base sales.\n\nIn both cases (promotion_active being True or False when temperature > 20), sales increase compared to the base sales.\n\nTherefore, when a promotion is introduced and the temperature is above 20 degrees, sales will definitely increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `sales_prediction` function to determine if sales will definitely increase when a promotion is introduced at temperatures above 20 degrees.\n\n1. **Base Case (Temperature ≤ 20):**\n   - If the temperature is 20 degrees or below, the sales calculation is straightforward.\n   - Regardless of whether the promotion is active or not, the sales will be:\n     - `base_sales` (which is 100) plus an additional amount based on the promotion status:\n       - If promotion is active: `100 + 30`\n       - If promotion is not active: `100`\n\n2. **Case (Temperature > 20):**\n   - If the temperature is above 20 degrees, the sales calculation changes:\n   - If the promotion is active, the sales will be:\n     - `base_sales` (which is 100) plus an additional 50 units.\n     - So, `100 + 50` which equals `150`.\n   - If the promotion is not active, the sales will be:\n     - `base_sales` (which is 100) plus an additional 20 units.\n     - So, `100 + 20` which equals `120`.\n\nNow, let's compare these scenarios with the base case:\n\n- For temperatures ≤ 20:\n  - Without promotion: Sales = 100\n  - With promotion: Sales = 130 (for temperature ≤ 20)\n- For temperatures > 20:\n  - Without promotion: Sales = 120\n  - With promotion: Sales = 150\n\nFrom this comparison, we can see that for both temperature ranges, introducing a promotion always results in higher sales compared to not having a promotion.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"If a promotion is introduced when the temperature is above 20 degrees, will sales definitely increase?\" is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The base sales value is set to 100.\n2. We need to consider two main conditions:\n   - Temperature (T) being greater than 20\n   - Promotion status (P)\n\n3. If T > 20 and P is active:\n   - Sales = base_sales + 50 = 100 + 50 = 150\n4. If T > 20 and P is not active:\n   - Sales = base_sales + 20 = 100 + 20 = 120\n5. If T ≤ 20 and P is active:\n   - Sales = base_sales + 30 = 100 + 30 = 130\n6. If T ≤ 20 and P is not active:\n   - Sales = base_sales = 100\n\nFrom the analysis above, we can see that:\n- When the temperature is above 20 and there is a promotion, sales increase to 150.\n- When the temperature is above 20 but there is no promotion, sales increase to 120.\n\nIn both cases where the temperature is above 20, whether there is a promotion or not, sales do increase from the base of 100.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_prediction` takes two parameters: `temperature` and `promotion_active`.\n\n2. The base sales value is set to 100.\n\n3. We have different scenarios based on the temperature and whether a promotion is active:\n   - If the temperature is greater than 20:\n     - And if promotion is active: Sales will be `base_sales + 50`\n     - If promotion is not active: Sales will be `base_sales + 20`\n   - If the temperature is 20 or below:\n     - And if promotion is active: Sales will be `base_sales + 30`\n     - If promotion is not active: Sales will be `base_sales`\n\n4. We need to determine if sales will definitely increase when a promotion is introduced and the temperature is above 20.\n\n5. Let's consider the specific scenario where the temperature is above 20 and a promotion is active:\n   - In this case, the sales prediction formula is `sales = base_sales + 50`.\n   - Since the base sales are 100, with a promotion active and temperature above 20, the new sales will be 150.\n   - This is an increase from the base sales of 100.\n\n6. However, we also need to consider the scenario where the temperature is 20 or below and a promotion is active:\n   - In this case, the sales prediction formula is `sales = base_sales + 30`.\n   - With a promotion active and temperature 20 or below, the new sales will be 130.\n   - This is still an increase from the base sales of 100, but it does not guarantee a definite increase over all possible conditions.\n\nSince the question asks for a definite increase in sales, and there is a scenario (temperature 20 or below) where the sales do not increase as much as the base plus 50, the answer is no, sales will not definitely increase in all cases.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Base Case (Temperature ≤ 20):**\n   - If the promotion is active, sales = base_sales + 30.\n   - If the promotion is not active, sales = base_sales.\n\n2. **Case When Temperature > 20:**\n   - If the promotion is active, sales = base_sales + 50.\n   - If the promotion is not active, sales = base_sales + 20.\n\nNow, let's compare the sales scenarios with and without promotions for both temperature ranges:\n\n- **Temperature ≤ 20:**\n  - With Promotion: Sales = 100 + 30 = 130\n  - Without Promotion: Sales = 100\n\n- **Temperature > 20:**\n  - With Promotion: Sales = 100 + 50 = 150\n  - Without Promotion: Sales = 100 + 20 = 120\n\nIn all cases, introducing a promotion results in an increase in sales compared to not having a promotion. Therefore, if a promotion is introduced when the temperature is above 20 degrees, sales will definitely increase.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the conditions:**\n   - If the temperature is above 20 degrees (`temperature > 20`), then we have two scenarios based on whether there is a promotion (`promotion_active`):\n     - If `promotion_active` is True, sales will be `base_sales + 50`.\n     - If `promotion_active` is False, sales will be `base_sales + 20`.\n\n2. **Base case (temperature ≤ 20):**\n   - If the temperature is not above 20 degrees, we again have two scenarios based on whether there is a promotion:\n     - If `promotion_active` is True, sales will be `base_sales + 30`.\n     - If `promotion_active` is False, sales will remain at `base_sales`.\n\n3. **Comparing scenarios:**\n   - When `temperature > 20` and `promotion_active` is True, sales will be `100 + 50 = 150`.\n   - When `temperature > 20` and `promotion_active` is False, sales will be `100 + 20 = 120`.\n   - When `temperature ≤ 20` and `promotion_active` is True, sales will be `100 + 30 = 130`.\n   - When `temperature ≤ 20` and `promotion_active` is False, sales will remain at `100`.\n\n4. **Determining if sales will definitely increase with a promotion:**\n   - In all cases where a promotion is active (`promotion_active` is True):\n     - For `temperature > 20`, sales increase from `base_sales` (which is 100) to either 120 or 150.\n     - For `temperature ≤ 20`, sales increase from `base_sales` (which is 100) to 130.\n\nSince in every scenario where a promotion is active, sales will increase from the base sales of 100, we can conclude that sales will definitely increase if a promotion is introduced.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
