  "Explanation": "The code checks if the 'current_temp' is more than 5 degrees below 'desired_temp'.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `adjust_temperature` takes two parameters: `sensor` and `desired_temp`.\n\n2. It first gets the current temperature from the sensor using `get_reading(sensor)`.\n\n3. It initializes a boolean variable `heater_on` to False.\n\n4. The function then checks if `current_temp` is less than `desired_temp - 5`.\n\n5. If this condition is true (meaning `current_temp` is significantly lower than `desired_temp`), it sets `heater_on` to True and increases the temperature by the difference between `desired_temp` and `current_temp`.\n\n6. If `current_temp` is not significantly lower than `desired_temp`, the function checks another condition: if `current_temp` is greater than `desired_temp + 5`. If this is true, it decreases the temperature but does not affect the value of `heater_on`.\n\n7. Regardless of whether the temperature is increased or decreased, the function returns the value of `heater_on`.\n\nGiven this logic, if the current temperature (`current_temp`) is significantly lower than the desired temperature (`desired_temp`), specifically below `desired_temp - 5`, the condition in step 4 will be true, and `heater_on` will be set to True.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `adjust_temperature` function to determine if 'heater_on' will likely be set to True when 'current_temp' is significantly lower than 'desired_temp'.\n\n1. The function first gets the current temperature reading from the sensor using `get_reading(sensor)`.\n2. It then checks if the current temperature is less than the desired temperature minus 5 degrees.\n3. If this condition is true (i.e., `current_temp < desired_temp - 5`), it sets `heater_on` to True and increases the temperature to match the desired temperature minus the current temperature.\n4. If the condition is not met, it checks if the current temperature is greater than the desired temperature plus 5 degrees and adjusts the temperature accordingly.\n\nThe question asks specifically about the case where the current temperature is significantly lower than the desired temperature. In this scenario, we need to focus on the condition `current_temp < desired_temp - 5`.\n\nIf the current temperature is significantly lower than the desired temperature, it means that the difference between the two temperatures is more than 5 degrees. Therefore, the condition `current_temp < desired_temp - 5` would evaluate to True, and as a result, `heater_on` would be set to True.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `adjust_temperature` takes two parameters: `sensor` (which we don't need to know about for this logic) and `desired_temp`.\n\n2. It first retrieves the `current_temp` using `get_reading(sensor)`.\n\n3. Then it checks if `current_temp` is less than `desired_temp - 5`. \n\n4. If this condition is true, it sets `heater_on` to `True` and increases the temperature by the difference between `desired_temp - current_temp`.\n\n5. If `current_temp` is not less than `desired_temp - 5`, it checks if `current_temp` is greater than `desired_temp + 5`. If this condition is true, it decreases the temperature but does not set `heater_on` to `True`.\n\n6. The question specifically asks if the 'current_temp' being \"significantly lower\" than 'desired_temp' would likely result in 'heater_on' being set to `True`.\n\n7. According to the code, 'heater_on' is only set to `True` when `current_temp` is less than `desired_temp - 5`. This means that 'current_temp' needs to be at least 5 degrees below the `desired_temp` for 'heater_on' to be set to `True`.\n\n8. The term \"significantly lower\" implies a much larger difference than just 5 degrees.\n\nTherefore, if 'current_temp' is \"significantly lower\" than 'desired_temp', it would indeed likely result in 'heater_on' being set to `True`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
