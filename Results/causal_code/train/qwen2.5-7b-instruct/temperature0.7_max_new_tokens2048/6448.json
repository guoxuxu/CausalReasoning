    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `alertStatus` method checks the value of `active` and prints either \"System is active.\" or \"System is inactive.\"\n\n2. We need to determine which method could change the value of `active` to trigger this specific print.\n\n3. The `deactivate` method sets `active` to false and calls `alertStatus`.\n\n4. The `activate` method sets `active` to true and also calls `alertStatus`.\n\n5. If \"System is inactive.\" is printed, it means `active` must be false at that moment.\n\n6. Given the methods provided, only `deactivate` sets `active` to false.\n\n7. Therefore, if \"System is inactive.\" is printed, it logically follows that the `deactivate` method was most likely called (though not necessarily exclusively, as `active` could have been set to false in another way not shown in the provided code).\n\nHowever, based on the information given and the logic of the methods provided, we can reasonably infer that the `deactivate` method was called when \"System is inactive.\" is printed.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `alertStatus` method checks the value of `active` and calls `sendAlert` with an appropriate message.\n2.

However, `active` could also be set to `false` in other ways:\n   - It could be initially `false` when the object is first instantiated.\n   - It could be set to `false` directly via `active = false;` somewhere else in the code.\n5. Therefore, just because `'System is inactive.'` is printed, it does not necessarily mean that the `deactivate` method was the one that caused `active` to become `false`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot definitively infer that the `deactivate` method was called solely based on the output.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
