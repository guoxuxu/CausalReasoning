    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_prediction` takes two parameters: `temperature` and `promotion_active`.\n\n2. The base sales are set to 100.\n\n3. If the temperature is above 20 degrees:\n   - And promotion is active, sales increase by 50.\n   - And promotion is not active, sales increase by 20.\n\n4. If the temperature is 20 degrees or below:\n   - And promotion is active, sales increase by 30.\n   - And promotion is not active, sales remain at the base of 100.\n\n5. We need to determine if a significant increase in sales can definitively indicate that the temperature was above 20 degrees.\n\n6. Let's consider the possible scenarios for a significant increase in sales:\n   - Temperature > 20 and promotion active: Sales = 100 + 50 = 150\n   - Temperature > 20 and promotion not active: Sales = 100 + 20 = 120\n   - Temperature <= 20 and promotion active: Sales = 100 + 30 = 130\n   - Temperature <= 20 and promotion not active: Sales = 100 (no change)\n\n7. From these scenarios, we see that significant increases (above 130) can occur in two cases:\n   - Temperature > 20 with promotion active (150)\n   - Temperature <= 20 with promotion active (130)\n\n8. Therefore, a significant increase in sales does not definitively indicate that the temperature was above 20 degrees; it could also be due to a promotion being active when the temperature was 20 degrees or below.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_prediction` calculates sales based on two factors: temperature and whether a promotion is active.\n2. There are different outcomes for sales depending on these factors:\n   - If temperature > 20 AND promotion is active: sales = base_sales + 50\n   - If temperature > 20 AND promotion is not active: sales = base_sales + 20\n   - If temperature ≤ 20 AND promotion is active: sales = base_sales + 30\n   - If temperature ≤ 20 AND promotion is not active: sales = base_sales\n\n3. We need to determine if significant sales increase can definitively mean the temperature was above 20 degrees.\n\n4. To have a significant sales increase, we need to compare it to the base sales (100). Let's consider possible scenarios:\n   - If the promotion is active:\n     - Sales could be 150 (temperature > 20) or 130 (temperature ≤ 20)\n   - If the promotion is not active:\n     - Sales could be 120 (temperature > 20) or 100 (temperature ≤ 20)\n\n5. For a significant increase, let's assume it means more than 120 (since 120 is the maximum without promotion).\n\n6. If sales are more than 120:\n   - It must be due to a temperature > 20 and a promotion being active, leading to 150 sales.\n   - Or it could be due to only a promotion being active and temperature ≤ 20, leading to 130 sales.\n\n7. Therefore, a significant sales increase does not definitively mean the temperature was above 20 degrees because there are other combinations of conditions that can lead to such an increase.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `sales_prediction` calculates sales based on temperature and whether a promotion is active.\n\n2. If the temperature is above 20 degrees:\n   - With promotion active: sales = base_sales + 50\n   - Without promotion: sales = base_sales + 20\n\n3. If the temperature is 20 degrees or below:\n   - With promotion active: sales = base_sales + 30\n   - Without promotion: sales = base_sales\n\n4. To determine if the temperature was definitely above 20 degrees when sales increased significantly, we need to consider all possible scenarios where sales could increase significantly.\n\n5. Significant increase in sales could happen in these cases:\n   - Temperature > 20 and promotion active (sales = 150)\n   - Temperature > 20 and promotion not active (sales = 120)\n   - Temperature ≤ 20 and promotion active (sales = 130)\n\n6. In all of these cases where sales increased significantly, it's possible for the temperature to be either above or at 20 degrees (with promotion active) or 20 degrees or below (with promotion active).\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the temperature was definitely above 20 degrees just because sales increased significantly.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem to understand the relationship between temperature, promotions, and sales.\n\n1. **Base Sales**: The base sales amount is 100.\n2. **Temperature Condition**:\n   - If the temperature is greater than 20 degrees:\n     - With promotion active: Sales = 100 + 50 = 150\n     - Without promotion active: Sales = 100 + 20 = 120\n   - If the temperature is not greater than 20 degrees:\n     - With promotion active: Sales = 100 + 30 = 130\n     - Without promotion active: Sales = 100\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where sales have increased significantly:\n\n- A significant increase could mean any substantial jump from the base sales of 100.\n- The possible sales amounts based on different conditions are 120, 130, and 150.\n\nGiven these possibilities:\n- Sales of 150 indicate the temperature was above 20 degrees AND promotion was active.\n- Sales of 130 indicate the temperature was below or equal to 20 degrees BUT promotion was active.\n- Sales of 120 indicate the temperature was above 20 degrees BUT promotion was not active.\n\nFrom this, we see that significant increases (to 150 or 130) could occur under multiple conditions, not just when the temperature is above 20 degrees.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the temperature was definitely above 20 degrees if sales have increased significantly.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
