  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The initial setup had the temperature at 25, which is above the threshold of 20. However, after applying an intervention by adjusting the temperature with a delta of -10, the new temperature becomes 15 degrees. Since this is below 20, willItRain will return true.",
  "causal_map": "temperature → willItRain; temperature → willItRain",
  "causal_map_integration": "The temperature directly influences whether it will rain, with lower temperatures increasing the likelihood of rain.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Temperature**: The initial temperature is set to 25 degrees.\n2. **Adjustment**: The temperature is then adjusted by a delta of -10 degrees.\n3. **New Temperature**: To find the new temperature, we calculate:\n   \\[\n   \\text{new temperature} = \\text{initial temperature} + \\Delta = 25 + (-10) = 15 \\text{ degrees}\n   \\]\n4. **willItRain Method**: This method checks if the temperature is less than 20 degrees. If it is, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n5. **Check Condition**: Since the new temperature is 15 degrees, which is less than 20 degrees, the condition for the `willItRain` method is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the `willItRain` method will return `true`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
