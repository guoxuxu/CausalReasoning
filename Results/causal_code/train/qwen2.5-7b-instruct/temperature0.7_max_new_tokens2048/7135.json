    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `infect_population` takes two parameters: `population` and `infection_rate`.\n2. It initializes an empty list `infected` to store the names of infected individuals.\n3. It iterates over each person in the `population`.\n4. For each person, it uses `random.random()` to generate a random number between 0 and 1.\n5. If this random number is less than the `infection_rate`, the person is considered infected and added to the `infected` list.\n6. The `infection_rate` is set to 0.3 in the provided example.\n\nNow, if we control and set the `infection_rate` to 0, let's see what happens:\n\n7. When `infection_rate` is 0, no matter what random number `random.random()` generates (which is always between 0 and 1), it will never be less than 0.\n8. Therefore, no person in the population will be added to the `infected` list.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if the infection rate is set to 0, there will be no infected individuals in the population.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

The key point here is that `random.random()` always returns a value between 0 and 1, inclusive of 0 but exclusive of 1.\n\n6. If we set the `infection_rate` to 0, then the condition `if random.random() < infection_rate:` will never be true because `random.random()` will always be greater than 0.\n\n7.
