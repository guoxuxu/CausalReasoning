    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `traffic_influence` takes two parameters: `speed` and `weather`.\n\n2.

When the weather is 'rainy', the function will subtract 20 from the current speed.\n\n6. This means that if the initial speed was 50 (as in the provided code), with 'rainy' weather, the new speed would be 50 - 20 = 30.\n\n7.
