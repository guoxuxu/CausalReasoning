The `check_status` method compares the `current_temperature` with the `target_temperature` and returns an action to take:\n   - If `current_temperature` > `target_temperature`, it returns 'Turn AC on'\n   - If `current_temperature` < `target_temperature`, it returns 'Turn heater on'\n   - If `current_temperature` == `target_temperature`, it returns 'Hold at current setting'\n\nNow, let's consider when the status would show 'Turn AC on':\n- This happens when `current_temperature` is greater than `target_temperature`.\n- For this to be true after an update, the only way the temperature could have increased enough to exceed the target is if the external factor was 'sunny' (since it increases the temperature by the most).\n\nHowever, we need to check if other conditions can also lead to 'Turn AC on':\n- If the initial `current_temperature` was already above the `target_temperature`, updating it further won't change the result.\n- If the `current_temperature` was below the `target_temperature` but became above it due to an external factor, then the external factor could have been 'sunny', 'cloudy', or even 'rainy' if the decrease brought it very close.\n\nGiven this analysis, it is not necessarily true that the external condition was 'sunny' just because the status shows 'Turn AC on'.

To conclude 'Turn AC on', the temperature needs to exceed the target temperature. This can happen with any of the three conditions, not just 'sunny'. \n\n7.

Considering the possible changes in temperature from the different external factors:\n   - 'sunny' can potentially make the temperature higher, but it's not the only factor that can lead to a temperature above the target.\n   - 'cloudy' will only slightly increase the temperature.\n   - 'rainy' will decrease the temperature, which is unlikely to cause the status to show 'Turn AC on'.\n6.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `TemperatureController` class has a method `update_temperature` which adjusts the `current_temperature` based on the `external_factor`.\n\n2.

The `check_status` method determines whether to turn the AC on, heater on, or hold at the current setting based on how `current_temperature` compares to `target_temperature`.\n\n4. If the status shows 'Turn AC on', it means `current_temperature` is greater than `target_temperature`.\n\n5. For 'sunny' external factor:\n   - Starting from 20°C, if it becomes sunny, the new temperature would be 20 + 5 = 25°C.\n   - This could potentially make `current_temperature` greater than `target_temperature`, leading to 'Turn AC on'.\n\n6.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1.
