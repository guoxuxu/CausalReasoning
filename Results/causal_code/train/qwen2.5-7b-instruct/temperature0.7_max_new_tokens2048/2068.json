    "Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: A `ShoppingCart` object is created.\n2. **Adding Items**: Two items with prices of 50 and 80 are added to the cart.\n3. **Applying Discount Code**: The `apply_discount_code` method is called with the argument `'SAVE20'`. This method multiplies each item price in the cart by 0.8 (i.e., applies an 80% discount).\n4. **Calculating Total**: The `calculate_total` method is called. It first checks if there are any items in the cart. Since there are, it proceeds to calculate the total. If the sum of the items is greater than 100, a 10% discount is applied. However, since the sum of the items is 130, a 10% discount is applied. But because the `apply_discount_code` method has already discounted the items by 20%, the `calculate_total` method will not apply the additional 10% discount.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n- Initially, the sum of the items is 130.\n- After applying the `'SAVE20'` discount code, each item is reduced by 20%. Therefore, the new sum of the items becomes \\(130 \\times 0.8 = 104\\).\n- The `calculate_total` method then applies a 10% discount on the sum of the items if the sum is greater than 100. Since the sum is 104, which is greater than 100, a 10% discount is applied. The final total is calculated as \\(104 - (104 \\times 0.1) = 104 - 10.4 = 93.6\\).\n\nGiven that the final total (93.6) is indeed less than the initial sum of the added item prices (130), and this reduction is due to the application of the `'SAVE20'` discount code, we can conclude that the discount code was successfully applied.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
