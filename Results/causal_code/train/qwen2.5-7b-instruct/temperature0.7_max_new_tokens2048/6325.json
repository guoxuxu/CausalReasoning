    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `addBook` method checks if the book is already in the stock using `this.stock.includes(book)`.\n2. If the book is not in the stock, it adds the book to the stock with `this.stock.push(book)` and logs \"Book added.\".\n3. The original implementation does not modify the `sales` attribute when adding a book.\n\nNow, let's consider the modification:\n- If we modify the `addBook` method to increase `sales` by 1 for every book added, the updated method would look like this:\n\n```javascript\naddBook(book) {\n  if (!this.stock.includes(book)) {\n    this.stock.push(book);\n    this.sales += 1; // This line is added\n    console.log('Book added.');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Book already in stock.');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. With this modification, whenever a book is added, `this.sales` will be incremented by 1.\n\nTherefore, under the modified `addBook` method, adding a book will indeed increase sales by 1.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
