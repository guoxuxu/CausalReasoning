    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `EnvironmentalControlSystem` class has an `adjustTemperature` method that adjusts the temperature based on the input value.\n\n2. If the new temperature is less than 18, the `turnOnHeater()` method is called.\n\n3. The `turnOnHeater()` method sets the temperature to 21, which is a default warm temperature.\n\n4. However, the method only gets called when the new temperature is explicitly set to be less than 18.\n\n5. There's no information provided about how the temperature was initially set or any other conditions under which the heater might be turned on.\n\n6. The code does not indicate that the heater being turned on necessarily implies the initial temperature was set below 18.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `EnvironmentalControlSystem` class has an `adjustTemperature` method that adjusts the temperature based on the input parameter `newTemp`.\n\n2.

The question asks if we can infer that the initial temperature was set below 18 if the heater was manually turned on.\n\n5. However, the code snippet does not mention any manual turning on of the heater.

The question asks if we can infer that the initial temperature was set below 18 if the heater was manually turned on.\n\nTo manually turn on the heater, it must be called via the `adjustTemperature` method with a value less than 18.
