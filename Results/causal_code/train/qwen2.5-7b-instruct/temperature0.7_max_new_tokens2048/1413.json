Therefore, the initial temperature of `20` will always make `isWeatherWarm()` return `true` unless the temperature is manually set to be less than or equal to `15` before calling `manualRainStart`.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that the temperature will not always decrease when `manualRainStart` is executed because the initial temperature of `20` will make `isWeatherWarm()` return `true`, preventing the temperature from decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
