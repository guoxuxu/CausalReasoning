    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have a function `process_data` that takes a `data` object as an argument.\n2.

If 'error' is not found, the function sets `data.corrected` to `True` and then performs additional checks on `data.input_value`.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude:\n\n- If 'error' is present in `data.status`, the function explicitly sets `data.corrected` to `False`.\n- If 'error' is not present, `data.corrected` might be set to `True`, but this does not affect the answer to our specific question.\n\nTherefore, if the 'status' of the data object is set to 'error', the 'corrected' attribute of the data object will indeed always be set to `False`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a function `process_data` that takes a `data` object as an argument.\n2.

If the condition is true (i.e., `'error'` is in `data.status`), then:\n   - `data.corrected` is set to `False`.\n   - The function returns `'Error found'`.\n\n5. If the condition is false (i.e., `'error'` is not in `data.status`), then:\n   - `data.corrected` is set to `True`.\n   - Some calculations are performed on `data.input_value`.\n   - A check is made to see if the calculated value is greater than 100.\n   - Depending on the result, either `'Value too high'` or `'Processing complete'` is returned.\n\n6.
