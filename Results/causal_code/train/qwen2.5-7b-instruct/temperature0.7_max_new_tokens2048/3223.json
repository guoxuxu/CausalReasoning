    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The function `weather_impact` takes one parameter `weather_condition`.\n\n2. It has two conditions:\n   - If `weather_condition` is 'sunny':\n     - `mood` is set to 'happy'\n     - `productivity` is set to `mood == 'happy'`, which means `True`\n   - If `weather_condition` is 'rainy':\n     - `mood` is set to 'sad'\n     - `sports_activity` is set to 'indoors'\n     - `productivity` is set to `mood == 'sad'`, which means `True`\n\n3. In both cases ('sunny' and 'rainy'), `productivity` is set to `True`.\n\n4. The question asks if we can infer that the weather was rainy if productivity is low.\n\n5. However, from our analysis, we see that productivity is always set to `True` regardless of whether the weather is sunny or rainy.\n\n6.
