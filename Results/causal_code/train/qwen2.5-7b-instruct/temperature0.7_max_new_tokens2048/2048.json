    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `temperature` is set to 70.\n   - `humidity` is set to 50.\n\n2. **simulateHeatWave Method**:\n   - Increases `temperature` by 20.\n   - Decreases `humidity` by 10.\n   \n3. **startRain Method**:\n   - Increases `humidity` by 20.\n   - If `humidity` exceeds 60, it decreases `temperature` by 5.\n\n4. **Sequence of Events**:\n   - We call `simulateHeatWave()` first.\n     - `temperature` becomes 90 (70 + 20).\n     - `humidity` becomes 40 (50 - 10).\n   - Then we call `startRain()` after `simulateHeatWave()`.\n     - `humidity` becomes 60 (40 + 20).\n     - Since `humidity` is now 60, `temperature` decreases by 5, making it 85 (90 - 5).\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where we block the `simulateHeatWave` method and then call `startRain()`:\n\n- If `simulateHeatWave` is blocked, `temperature` remains at 70.\n- We still call `startRain()`.\n  - `humidity` increases to 70 (50 + 20).\n  - Since `humidity` is 70, which is greater than 60, `temperature` decreases by 5, making it 65 (70 - 5).\n\nIn both scenarios, the increase in `temperature` is not due to the `startRain` method alone. The initial increase in `temperature` comes from the `simulateHeatWave` method, and the decrease in `temperature` during `startRain` is due to the condition check on `humidity`.\n\nTherefore, the increase in `temperature` cannot be caused solely by the `startRain` method if `simulateHeatWave` is blocked.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
