    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficLightsSystem` class has an initializer that sets the initial state of the traffic light based on whether it is raining or not.\n\n2. The `change_light` method checks if it is raining (`self.is_rainy`).\n\n3. If it is raining, the traffic light changes to 'Yellow'.\n\n4. If it is not raining, the traffic light cycles between 'Green' and 'Red'.\n\n5. The question asks specifically about what happens when it starts raining.\n\n6. When it starts raining, the condition `if self.is_rainy:` will be true.\n\n7. As a result, the traffic light color will change from whatever it was previously (likely 'Green' or 'Red') to 'Yellow'.\n\nTherefore, if it starts raining, the traffic light will indeed change its current state.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficLightsSystem` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the system with a boolean `is_rainy` value and sets the initial light color to 'Green'.\n\n2. The `change_light` method checks if it is raining (`self.is_rainy`).\n\n3. If it is raining, the light color changes to 'Yellow'.\n4. If it is not raining, the light color cycles between 'Green' and 'Red'.\n\n5. Now, let's consider the scenario where it starts raining.\n\n6. When it starts raining, the system will call the `change_light` method.\n\n7. In the `change_light` method, there is a direct condition for when `self.is_rainy` is True (it starts raining).\n\n8. When it starts raining, the light color will immediately change to 'Yellow'.\n\nTherefore, if it starts raining, the traffic light will indeed change its current state from 'Green' to 'Yellow'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Since we are considering the scenario where it starts raining, `self.is_rainy` will be `True`.\n\n9. Given that `self.is_rainy` is `True`, the method sets `self.light_color` to 'Yellow'.\n\nTherefore, if it starts raining, the traffic light will indeed change its current state from 'Green' to 'Yellow'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

When it starts raining:\n   - The `change_light` method is called.\n   - Since `self.is_rainy` is True, the light color changes from whatever it was (initially 'Green') to 'Yellow'.\n\n7.
