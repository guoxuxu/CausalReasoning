    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `increase_temperature` method checks if adding the specified increment to the current temperature would exceed the maximum temperature (`max_temp`).\n\n2. If the sum of the current temperature and the increment is greater than `max_temp`, the method sets `current_temp` to `max_temp`.\n\n3. If the sum does not exceed `max_temp`, the method simply adds the increment to `current_temp`.\n\n4. The question states that `current_temp` doesn't change after calling `increase_temperature`.\n\n5.
