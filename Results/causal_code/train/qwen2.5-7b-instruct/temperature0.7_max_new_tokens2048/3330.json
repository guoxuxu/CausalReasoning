    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Values**:\n   - A = 5\n   - B = 10\n   - C = A + B = 5 + 10 = 15\n   - D = C * 2 = 15 * 2 = 30\n\n2. **Condition Check**:\n   - The condition is `if B > 5:` which is true because B = 10.\n   - Therefore, E = D + 10 = 30 + 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Effect of Increasing A**:\n   - If A increases, let's say to A' where A' > 5 (since B is already 10 and we're only considering the effect of A).\n   - New value of C = A' + B.\n     - Since A' > 5 and B remains 10, A' + 10 > 5 + 10 = 15.\n   - So, C will definitely be greater than the original value of C (which was 15).\n\nTherefore, if A increases, C will necessarily increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
