    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `evaluate_performance` method checks two conditions to determine if an employee is promoted:\n   - If sales figures are greater than 100,000.\n   - If previous performance is 'excellent' and sales figures are greater than 50,000.\n\n2. If neither of these conditions is met, the `is_promoted` attribute remains `False`.\n\n3. We are given that the employee's sales figures were less than 100,000 and they were not promoted.\n\n4. Since the first condition (sales > 100,000) was not met, we need to consider the second condition.\n\n5. For the second condition to be true, both of the following must be true:\n   - Previous performance must be 'excellent'.\n   - Sales figures must be greater than 50,000.\n\n6. Given that the employee was not promoted, it means that even if their sales were greater than 50,000, their previous performance could not have been 'excellent'.\n\n7.

If an employee's sales figures are less than 100000, they do not meet the first condition for automatic promotion.\n\n3. For the second condition (promotion based on excellent previous performance and sales figures > 50000), the following must be true:\n   - Their previous performance must be 'excellent'.\n   - Their sales figures must be greater than 50000.\n\n4. If the employee is not promoted despite having sales figures < 100000, it means neither of the above conditions were met.\n\n5. This could happen if:\n   - Their previous performance was not 'excellent'.\n   - Their sales figures were less than or equal to 50000 (but we know it's less than 100000, so this part is already covered).\n\n6.

However, this doesn't necessarily mean their previous performance was not excellent. It could be that their previous performance was indeed excellent, but their sales figures did not meet the threshold of 50,000.\n\n7. The only way to guarantee that previous performance was not excellent would be if the employee's sales figures were less than or equal to 50,000.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot definitively say that the employee's previous performance was not excellent based solely on the information provided.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `evaluate_performance` method determines whether an employee is promoted based on two conditions:\n   - If sales figures are greater than 100,000.\n   - If previous performance is 'excellent' and sales figures are greater than 50,000.\n\n2. If neither of these conditions is met, the `is_promoted` attribute remains `False`.\n\n3. We're given that the employee had sales figures less than 100,000 and wasn't promoted.\n\n4. Since the first condition (sales > 100,000) is not met, we don't need to consider it further for this case.\n\n5. For the employee to be promoted, the second condition would need to be true:\n   - Previous performance must be 'excellent'\n   - Sales figures must be greater than 50,000\n\n6. Since the employee wasn't promoted, at least one part of the second condition must be false:\n   - Either the previous performance was not 'excellent', or the sales figures were not greater than 50,000.\n\n7. Given that the sales figures are less than 100,000, it's possible that the sales figures could still be greater than 50,000, meaning the previous performance could have been 'excellent'.\n\n8. However, if the sales figures are less than 50,000, then the previous performance cannot have been 'excellent' for the employee to remain non-promoted.\n\n9. But the question specifically asks about the case where the employee didn't get promoted due to having sales figures less than 100,000.\n\nTherefore, with the given information, we can conclude that if an employee had sales figures less than 100,000 and wasn't promoted, it does mean their previous performance was not excellent, as the sales figure being too low would prevent the second condition from being met even if the performance was excellent.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If both conditions are met, the employee is promoted.\n\n2. If an employee's sales figures are less than 100000 and they were not promoted, we can analyze the possible reasons:\n   - The first condition (sales > 100000) did not apply because the sales figures were less than 100000.\n   - Therefore, the second condition must have been false for them to be not promoted.\n\n3.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `evaluate_performance` method checks three conditions to determine if an employee is promoted:\n   - If `sales_figures > 100000`, the employee is promoted.\n   - If `previous_performance == 'excellent'` and `sales_figures > 50000`, the employee is promoted.\n   - Otherwise, the employee is not promoted.\n\n2. We are given that the employee's `sales_figures` are less than 100000, and they were not promoted.\n\n3. Since their `sales_figures` are less than 100000, the first condition (sales figures > 100000) is not met, so we can rule out the possibility of promotion based on high sales alone.\n\n4. For the second condition to be true (promotion due to excellent previous performance and sales figures > 50000), both parts must be true simultaneously. However, since the employee was not promoted, at least one part of this condition must be false.\n\n5. Given that the first condition failed (since sales figures < 100000), for the employee to still not be promoted, it means the second condition also did not hold. This implies that either the previous performance was not 'excellent', or the sales figures were not greater than 50000.\n\n6. Therefore, the fact that the employee was not promoted and had sales figures less than 100000 means that their previous performance could not have been 'excellent' for the second condition to fail.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to determine if an employee with sales figures < 100,000 who wasn't promoted must have had non-excellent previous performance.\n\n2. From the code, we know that:\n   - If sales figures > 100,000, then is_promoted = True.\n   - If previous_performance = 'excellent' and sales figures > 50,000, then is_promoted = True.\n   - Otherwise (including sales figures ≤ 100,000 and other conditions), is_promoted = False.\n\n3. The question states that the employee had sales figures < 100,000 and wasn't promoted.\n\n4. Since the employee wasn't promoted, we can look at the \"otherwise\" condition:\n   - This condition applies when sales figures ≤ 100,000 AND either previous_performance ≠ 'excellent' OR sales figures ≤ 50,000.\n\n5. Given that sales figures < 100,000, we don't need to consider the sales figures ≤ 50,000 part of the \"otherwise\" condition.\n\n6. Therefore, for the employee to be not promoted with sales figures < 100,000, it must be that previous_performance ≠ 'excellent'.\n\n7. This means that having sales figures < 100,000 and not being promoted does imply that the previous performance was not excellent.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Condition 1:** If `sales_figures > 100000`, then `is_promoted` is set to `True`.\n2. **Condition 2:** If `previous_performance == 'excellent'` and `sales_figures > 50000`, then `is_promoted` is set to `True`.\n3. **Else Condition:** If neither of the above conditions is met (i.e., `sales_figures ≤ 100000` and either `previous_performance != 'excellent'` or both), then `is_promoted` is set to `False`.\n\nGiven:\n- The employee's sales figures are less than 100000.\n- The employee was not promoted (`is_promoted = False`).\n\nFrom the third condition, we know that if the employee was not promoted, it must be because either:\n- Their sales figures were less than or equal to 100000 AND their previous performance was not 'excellent', OR\n- They did not meet both criteria for the second condition.\n\nSince we know their sales figures are less than 100000, let's focus on the second part of the condition. For the employee to be not promoted, their previous performance cannot have been 'excellent'. This means their previous performance was not 'excellent'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\": \"Yes\"}.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",
