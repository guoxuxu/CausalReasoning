    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `process_data` function takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. It checks if the value of `data['temperature']` is greater than 100.\n3. If the condition is true, it sets `data['status']` to 'critical' and calls the `alert('System Overheat')` function.\n4. If the condition is false, it sets `data['status']` to 'normal'.\n5. The function then returns the modified `data`.\n\nNow, for the question: \"If the `alert('System Overheat')` function is called, does this mean the originally passed 'temperature' in 'system_data' must have been above 100 degrees?\"\n\n- The `alert('System Overheat')` function is called when the temperature is greater than 100.\n- Therefore, if `alert('System Overheat')` is called, it confirms that the original temperature was indeed above 100 degrees.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
