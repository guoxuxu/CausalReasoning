    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `receive_email(has_internet)` returns `True` only if both `has_internet` is `True` and a randomly chosen boolean value from `[True, False]` is `True`.\n\n2. Since the boolean value is chosen randomly, there's a 50% chance that it will be `True` and a 50% chance that it will be `False`, even when `has_internet` is `True`.\n\n3. Therefore, just because `has_internet` is `True`, `email_received` does not have to be `True`. It depends on the random choice made within the function.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
