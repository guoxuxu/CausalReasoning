    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - `desired_temp` is set to 75.\n   - `current_temp` is initialized to 70.\n   - `ambient_temp` is initially 65.\n\n2. **Condition Check**:\n   - The `adjust_temp` method checks the condition based on the difference between `ambient_temp` and `desired_temp`.\n   - Since `ambient_temp` (65) is less than `desired_temp` (75) minus 5 (i.e., 70), the condition `if ambient_temp < self.desired_temp - 5:` is true.\n\n3. **Heating On**:\n   - When the condition is met, `heating_on()` is called.\n   - `heating_on()` increments `current_temp` by 5.\n   - Therefore, `current_temp` will be updated from 70 to 75.\n\n4. **Final State**:\n   - After the adjustment, `current_temp` becomes 75, which matches the `desired_temp`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the `current_temp` does indeed increase to reach the `desired_temp` after `adjust_temp` is called.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial conditions are:\n   - Ambient temperature (ambient_temp) is 65\n   - Desired temperature (desired_temp) is 75\n   - Current temperature (current_temp) is 70\n\n2. The `adjust_temp` method checks the following conditions:\n   - If ambient_temp < desired_temp - 5, then heating_on() is called\n   - If ambient_temp > desired_temp + 5, then cooling_on() is called\n   - Otherwise, system_off() is called\n\n3. Let's check the condition for our initial values:\n   - desired_temp - 5 = 75 - 5 = 70\n   - ambient_temp (65) is less than 70\n\n4. Since ambient_temp is less than desired_temp - 5, the condition for heating_on() is met.\n\n5. The heating_on() method increases the current_temp by 5:\n   - current_temp += 5\n   - 70 + 5 = 75\n\n6. After calling heating_on(), the current_temp becomes 75, which matches the desired_temp.\n\nTherefore, the current_temp does indeed increase to reach the desired_temp after adjust_temp is called.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial conditions are:\n   - `ambient_temp` is 65\n   - `desired_temp` is 75\n   - `current_temp` is 70 (set in the constructor)\n\n2. The `adjust_temp` method is called with `ambient_temp` of 65.\n\n3. We need to evaluate the condition inside the `if-elif-else` block:\n   - `ambient_temp < self.desired_temp - 5` becomes `65 < 70`, which is True.\n   - Therefore, we execute the code within the first `if` block: `self.heating_on()`.\n\n4. The `heating_on` method increments `current_temp` by 5:\n   - `self.current_temp += 5`\n   - So, `current_temp` changes from 70 to 75.\n\n5. After calling `heating_on`, `current_temp` is now 75.\n\n6. The `adjust_temp` method then checks again if any further adjustments are needed:\n   - `ambient_temp` is still 65\n   - `desired_temp` is 75\n   - `current_temp` is now 75\n\n7. Since `current_temp` is now equal to `desired_temp`, no further action is taken.\n\nTherefore, the `current_temp` does indeed increase to match the `desired_temp` after `adjust_temp` is called.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

We call the `adjust_temp` method with the current ambient temperature of 65.\n\n3. In the `adjust_temp` method:\n   - The first condition checks if `ambient_temp < desired_temp - 5`.\n     - 65 < 75 - 5\n     - 65 < 70 (which is True)\n   \n4. Since the condition is true, the `heating_on` method is called.\n\n5. In the `heating_on` method:\n   - The current temperature increases by 5 degrees.\n   - New current_temp = 70 + 5 = 75.\n\n6.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial conditions are:\n   - ambient_temp = 65\n   - desired_temp = 75\n   - current_temp = 70 (as set in the `__init__` method)\n\n2. The `adjust_temp` method is called with `ambient_temp`.\n\n3. Inside `adjust_temp`:\n   - We check if `ambient_temp < self.desired_temp - 5`\n     - 65 < 70 (True)\n   - Since the condition is true, we call `heating_on()`.\n\n4. The `heating_on` method increments `current_temp` by 5:\n   - current_temp becomes 75.\n\n5. After calling `heating_on`, the method ends without further adjustments because the other conditions (`ambient_temp > self.desired_temp + 5` and `else`) are not met.\n\n6.
