    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `increase_production` calculates `production_units` based on two parameters: `cost_increase` and `demand_rising`.\n\n2. If `demand_rising` is True:\n   - `production_units = 100 + cost_increase`\n   - This means `production_units` will always be at least 100 (if cost_increase is 0) and can be higher depending on the value of `cost_increase`.\n\n3. If `demand_rising` is False:\n   - `production_units = 50 + cost_increase // 2`\n   - Here, `production_units` starts at 50 and increases by half of `cost_increase`.\n   - For example, if `cost_increase` is 2, then `production_units` would be 51.\n   - If `cost_increase` is 4, then `production_units` would be 52.\n\n4. We need to determine if `production_units` being more than 100 allows us to conclude that `demand_rising` is True.\n\n5. From point 2, we know that when `demand_rising` is True, `production_units` will always be at least 100.\n6. However, from point 3, we see that even when `demand_rising` is False, `production_units` can still reach values above 100 as long as `cost_increase` is sufficiently large (e.g., 100 for a cost_increase of 200).\n\n7. Therefore, observing `production_units` to be more than 100 does not definitively indicate that `demand_rising` is True, as it could also happen when `demand_rising` is False with a high enough `cost_increase`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `increase_production` takes two parameters:\n   - `cost_increase`: an integer representing the increase in cost.\n   - `demand_rising`: a boolean indicating whether demand is rising.\n\n2. The function returns `production_units`, which is calculated based on the value of `demand_rising`.\n\n3. If `demand_rising` is True:\n   - `production_units = 100 + cost_increase`\n   - This means that regardless of the value of `cost_increase`, as long as `demand_rising` is True, `production_units` will always be at least 101 (since `cost_increase` is at least 1).\n\n4. If `demand_rising` is False:\n   - `production_units = 50 + cost_increase // 2`\n   - Here, `cost_increase // 2` means the integer division of `cost_increase` by 2, so the minimum value for `production_units` would be 50 (when `cost_increase` is 0), and it increases from there but will never reach 100 if `cost_increase` is less than 100.\n\n5. We need to determine if `production_units` being more than 100 allows us to conclude that `demand_rising` is True.\n\n6. From point 3, we know that if `demand_rising` is True, `production_units` will definitely be more than 100 (at least 101).\n7. From point 4, we know that if `demand_rising` is False, `production_units` can only be up to 99 (if `cost_increase` is 98, then `production_units = 50 + 98 // 2 = 99`).\n\nTherefore, if `production_units` is observed to be more than 100, we can indeed conclude that `demand_rising` is True.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the function and analyze the conditions under which `production_units` could be more than 100.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - The function `increase_production` takes two parameters: `cost_increase` (an integer) and `demand_rising` (a boolean).\n\n2. **Conditional Logic**:\n   - If `demand_rising` is `True`, then:\n     - `production_units = 100 + cost_increase`\n   - If `demand_rising` is `False`, then:\n     - `production_units = 50 + cost_increase // 2`\n\n3. **Condition for `production_units > 100`**:\n   - For `demand_rising == True`:\n     - `production_units = 100 + cost_increase`\n       - This will always be greater than 100 if `cost_increase > 0`.\n   - For `demand_rising == False`:\n     - `production_units = 50 + cost_increase // 2`\n       - To make this greater than 100:\n         - `50 + cost_increase // 2 > 100`\n         - Simplifying, we get:\n           - `cost_increase // 2 > 50`\n           - Therefore, `cost_increase > 100`\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- If `production_units > 100`, it can either mean:\n  - `demand_rising == True` (which is always true as long as `cost_increase > 0`), or\n  - `demand_rising == False` and `cost_increase > 100`.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot conclusively say that `demand_rising` must be `True` just because `production_units` is more than 100. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

We need to determine if `production_units` being more than 100 allows us to conclude that `demand_rising` is True.\n\n5. Let's consider the condition for `production_units > 100`:\n   - For `demand_rising` being True: `production_units` = 100 + `cost_increase`. This will always be at least 100, but not necessarily more than 100 unless `cost_increase` is positive.\n   - For `demand_rising` being False: `production_units` = 50 + `cost_increase` // 2. This will never exceed 100 because even if `cost_increase` is very large, `cost_increase` // 2 will be half of it (rounded down), so adding 50 will not push it over 100.\n\n6. Therefore, if `production_units` is more than 100, it must be due to the case where `demand_rising` is True and `cost_increase` is greater than 0.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that if `production_units` is observed to be more than 100, then `demand_rising` must be True.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
