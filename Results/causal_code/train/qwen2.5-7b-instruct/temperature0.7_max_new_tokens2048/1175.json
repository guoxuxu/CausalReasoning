    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `WeatherController` class has an `adjust_heating` method that checks if the `outdoor_temp` is less than 15.\n2. If `outdoor_temp` is less than 15, the heating is turned on (`self.heating_on = True`).\n3. If `outdoor_temp` is 15 or above, the heating remains off (`self.heating_on = False`).\n4. In the `main()` function, an instance of `WeatherController` is created with a temperature of 20.\n5. `current_outdoor_temp` is set to 10.\n6. The `adjust_heating` method is called with `current_outdoor_temp`.\n7. Since 10 is less than 15, the heating is turned on.\n8. The program then checks `wc.heating_on`, which is `True`, and prints 'Heating is turned on due to low temperature.'\n\nNow, to address the question:\n- We want to intervene to change `current_outdoor_temp` to demonstrate it was higher than 15.\n- If we change `current_outdoor_temp` to a value 15 or above (e.g., 16), the `adjust_heating` method will set `self.heating_on` to `False`.\n- This would result in printing 'No need for heating.', as we want to demonstrate.\n\nSo, yes, we can intervene to change `current_outdoor_temp` to a value 15 or above to show that the condition for needing heating is not met.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Otherwise, `heating_on` is set to `False`.\n5. In the `main` function, `current_outdoor_temp` is set to 10, which is less than 15.\n6. Therefore, `heating_on` is set to `True`, and the message 'Heating is turned on due to low temperature.' is printed.\n\nNow, the question asks if we can intervene to change `current_outdoor_temp` to demonstrate it was higher than 15. \n\nTo demonstrate that the temperature is higher than 15, we would need to change `current_outdoor_temp` to a value greater than 15, such as 16 or any number above 15.\n\nIf we change `current_outdoor_temp` to 16 (or any value > 15) and then call `wc.adjust_heating(current_outdoor_temp)` again, `heating_on` will be set to `False` because the condition `outdoor_temp < 15` will no longer be true.
