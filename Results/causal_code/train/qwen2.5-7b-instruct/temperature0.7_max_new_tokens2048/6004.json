    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `weather_condition()` function returns one of three possible weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. The `decide_picnic(weather)` function takes the weather condition as input and decides whether to go on a picnic based on that condition:\n   - If the weather is 'sunny', it returns 'go'.\n   - If the weather is 'rainy', it returns 'cancel'.\n   - If the weather is 'cloudy', it returns 'wait'.\n\n3. The variable `weather_today` is assigned the result of calling `weather_condition()`, which means it could be 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n4. The variable `picnic_decision` is assigned the result of calling `decide_picnic(weather_today)`. \n\n5. For the picnic to be cancelled, the `decide_picnic(weather)` function must have returned 'cancel'.
