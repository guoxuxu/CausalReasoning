  "Explanation": "In the 'compute_final_score' function, 'final_score' is the sum of 'grade', 'bonus', and an additional 20 if 'isMember' is True, or just 'grade' + 'bonus' if not. Therefore, any change in 'bonus' directly influences the 'final_score'.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `compute_final_score` function takes three parameters: `grade`, `bonus`, and `isMember`.\n\n2. Inside the function, it checks if `isMember` is `True`. If it is:\n   - It adds `20` to both `grade` and `bonus` to calculate `final_score`.\n   - So, `final_score = grade + bonus + 20`.\n\n3. If `isMember` is not `True` (i.e., `False`):\n   - It only adds `bonus` to `grade` to calculate `final_score`.\n   - So, `final_score = grade + bonus`.\n\n4. In the provided code snippet:\n   - `membership_status` is set to `True`.\n   - `basic_grade` is `85`.\n   - `additional_bonus` is `15`.\n\n5. Since `isMember` is `True`, the calculation will be:\n   - `final_score = basic_grade + additional_bonus + 20`\n   - Substituting the values: `final_score = 85 + 15 + 20`\n\n6. The formula shows that `final_score` directly depends on the value of `bonus` when `isMember` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, altering the 'bonus' value does affect the 'final_score'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` takes three parameters: `grade`, `bonus`, and `isMember`.\n\n2.

In the provided invocation:\n   - `membership_status` is set to `True`, so `isMember` will be `True`.\n   - `basic_grade` is set to `85`.\n   - `additional_bonus` is set to `15`.\n\n4. Given `isMember` is `True`, the calculation for `final_score` will be:\n   - `final_score = basic_grade + additional_bonus + 20`\n   - Substituting the values: `final_score = 85 + 15 + 20`\n\n5. Now, let's consider how changing the `bonus` value would affect the `final_score`:\n   - If we increase `bonus` by any amount, say `x`, the new `final_score` would be:\n     - `new_final_score = (basic_grade + x) + (additional_bonus + x) + 20`\n     - Simplifying: `new_final_score = basic_grade + additional_bonus + 20 + 2x`\n   - This shows that the `final_score` increases by `2x` when `bonus` is increased by `x`.\n\n6.
