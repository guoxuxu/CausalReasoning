  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Resetting the scheduler with resetScheduler() sets count to 0, and follow-up calls to addTask() increment count from 0 upwards. Thus, invoking getCount() post these actions will reflect an increase in count due to the subsequent addTask() calls.",
  "causal_map": "resetScheduler() → count = 0; addTask() → count++; getCount() → count",
  "causal_map_integration": "Resetting the scheduler sets the count to zero, adding a task increments the count, and getting the count returns the current value of count.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `resetScheduler()` method sets `count` to 0.\n2. After calling `resetScheduler()`, `count` is guaranteed to be 0.\n3.

The `getCount()` method returns the current value of `count`.\n6. After both `resetScheduler()` and `addTask()` have been called, `getCount()` will return 1.\n\nGiven this sequence of operations:\n- `resetScheduler()` -> `addTask()` -> `getCount()`\n\nThe `getCount()` method would indeed show an increase in count compared to what it would return right after `resetScheduler()`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
