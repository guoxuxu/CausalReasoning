    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `calculateGrowth` method calculates the future value of an investment over a certain number of years based on the initial investment and growth rate.\n\n2. The formula used is:\n   \\[ \\text{value} = \\text{initialInvestment} \\times (1 + \\text{growthRate})^{\\text{years}} \\]\n\n3. If we decrease the number of years (`years`) while keeping the `initialInvestment` and `growthRate` constant, the exponent in the formula will be smaller.\n\n4. A smaller exponent means that the overall value will be lower because you're multiplying by `(1 + growthRate)` fewer times.\n\n5. For example:\n   - If `years = 10`, the calculation would be \\(\\text{initialInvestment} \\times (1 + \\text{growthRate})^{10}\\).\n   - If `years = 5`, the calculation would be \\(\\text{initialInvestment} \\times (1 + \\text{growthRate})^{5}\\).\n\n6. Since \\(5 < 10\\), \\((1 + \\text{growthRate})^5 < (1 + \\text{growthRate})^{10}\\), and thus the final value will be lower when `years = 5`.\n\nTherefore, lowering the number of years in the method's input will indeed decrease the outcome of the `calculateGrowth` method without changing the `initialInvestment` and `growthRate`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The formula used is:\n   \\[ \\text{value} = \\text{initialInvestment} \\times (1 + \\text{growthRate})^{\\text{years}} \\]\n\n3. If we lower the number of years (`years`), we are essentially reducing the exponent in the above formula.\n\n4. Reducing the exponent in the formula will result in a smaller overall value, assuming the growth rate is positive (which it is, as it's a percentage increase).\n\n5. This reduction in the exponent directly correlates to a decrease in the calculated growth value, as the investment does not have as much time to grow.\n\n6. The initial investment and growth rate remain unchanged, so any change in the number of years is solely responsible for the decrease in the outcome.\n\nTherefore, lowering the number of years in the method's input would indeed achieve a decrease in the outcome of the `calculateGrowth` method without changing the initialInvestment and growthRate.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

After 2 years, it is \\(1000 \\times 1.05^2\\).
