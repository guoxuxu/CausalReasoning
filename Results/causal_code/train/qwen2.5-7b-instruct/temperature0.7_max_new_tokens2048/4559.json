    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Base Score Calculation**: The base score is calculated as the average of all scores in the `data` list.\n   - Formula: \\( \\text{base\\_score} = \\frac{\\sum \\text{data}}{\\text{len(data)}} \\)\n\n2. **Improved Score Calculation**: The improved score depends on whether there are any extra hours (`extra_hours`) studied.\n   - If `extra_hours > 0`, the improved score is the base score plus twice the number of extra hours.\n   - If `extra_hours <= 0`, the improved score remains the base score.\n\n3. **Question Focus**: We need to determine if the average base score increasing will result in an increased improved score, assuming no extra study hours (`extra_hours = 0`).\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n   - When `extra_hours = 0`, the formula for the improved score simplifies to: \\( \\text{improved\\_score} = \\text{base\\_score} \\).\n   - Therefore, the improved score is directly equal to the base score when no extra hours are studied.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: If the average base score increases, and we assume no extra study hours, then the improved score will remain unchanged because it is equal to the new base score.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is that the improved score will not increase if the average base score increases and no extra study hours are assumed.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**:\n   - `data` is a list of scores.\n   - `extra_hours` is an integer that represents additional study hours.\n   \n2. **Base Score Calculation**:\n   - The base score is calculated as the average of all scores in the `data` list: `base_score = sum(data) / len(data)`.\n\n3. **Improved Score Calculation**:\n   - If `extra_hours > 0`, the improved score is calculated as `improved_score = base_score + (extra_hours * 2)`.\n   - If `extra_hours <= 0`, the improved score remains the same as the base score: `improved_score = base_score`.\n\n4. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if the improved score will increase when only the average base score increases, assuming there are no extra study hours (`extra_hours = 0`).\n\n5. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - When `extra_hours = 0`, the formula for the improved score simplifies to `improved_score = base_score`.\n   - Therefore, the improved score is directly equal to the base score.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the improved score is exactly the same as the base score when there are no extra study hours, any increase in the base score will result in an equivalent increase in the improved score.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
