  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Initially, the plant receives suboptimal water (150 ml), insufficient for the optimal rate but enough to avoid 0 growth. Increasing the water to 250 ml satisfies the optimal water requirement, potentially increasing the growth rate by 1 point as other conditions remain within acceptable non-zero growth thresholds.",

    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial conditions are:\n   - Water: 150 ml\n   - Sunlight: 7 hours\n   - Temperature: 22°C\n\n2. The growth rate is calculated based on these conditions.\n\n3. For water:\n   - The condition is `if self.water >= 200`: \n     - With 150 ml, this is False.\n     - With 250 ml, this becomes True.\n\n4.
