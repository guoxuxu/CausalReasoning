  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Directly setting c to a higher value invariably leads to an increase in d. Since d is computed as d = c * 2, any increase in c, regardless of how it is achieved (in this case, by direct setting/intervention), results in a directly proportional increase in d.",
  "causal_map": "a → c; b → c; c → d",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The expression for `c` is `a + b`.\n2. `a` is defined as `x * 5`.\n3. `b` is defined as `y + 3`.\n4. Therefore, `c` can be rewritten as `(x * 5) + (y + 3)`.\n\nNow, if we set `c` to a higher fixed value directly, we need to consider how this affects the calculation of `d`.\n\n1. `d` is calculated as `c * 2`.\n2. If we set `c` to a higher fixed value, say `c'`, then `d` would become `c' * 2`.\n\nHowever, setting `c` directly to a higher value bypasses the original computation that leads to `c`. Instead, we are altering the value of `c` independently.\n\nGiven that:\n- The original value of `c` is `(x * 5) + (y + 3)`\n- We are setting `c` to a higher fixed value, let's call it `C`\n\nThe new value of `d` becomes `C * 2`.\n\nSince `C` is higher than the original value of `c`, and `d` is directly proportional to `c`, setting `c` to a higher fixed value will indeed result in a higher value for `d`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute(x, y)` calculates several intermediate values:\n   - `a = x * 5`\n   - `b = y + 3`\n   - `c = a + b`\n   - `d = c * 2`\n\n2. To determine if setting `c` to a higher fixed value will increase `d`, we need to consider how `d` is calculated:\n   - `d` is directly proportional to `c`, as `d = c * 2`.\n\n3. If `c` is increased by a fixed amount, then `d` will also increase by twice that amount because of the multiplication factor of 2.\n\n4. Therefore, setting `c` to a higher fixed value will indeed result in `d` increasing.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The value of `d` is then calculated as:\n   - `d = c * 2`\n   - Substituting the expression for `c`, we get:\n   - `d = ((x * 5) + (y + 3)) * 2`\n\n4. Now, if we set `c` to a higher fixed value, it means we are directly increasing the value of `c`.\n\n5.
