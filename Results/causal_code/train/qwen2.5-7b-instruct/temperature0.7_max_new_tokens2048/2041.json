    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `calculate_interest` function takes three parameters: `principal`, `rate`, and `years`.\n\n2. These parameters are used to calculate the interest and then the total amount.\n\n3. The formula for calculating interest is:\n   \\[ \\text{interest} = \\text{principal} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\text{rate}}{100}\\right) \\times \\text{years} \\]\n\n4. The total amount after the investment period is:\n   \\[ \\text{total\\_amount} = \\text{principal} + \\text{interest} \\]\n\n5. In the given code:\n   - `principal` is set to 1000\n   - `deposit_rate` (which is equivalent to `rate`) is set to 5\n   - `investment_period` (which is equivalent to `years`) is set to 10\n\n6. If we change the `deposit_rate` from 5 to another value, the interest calculation will be affected because it directly multiplies with the `rate`.\n\n7.

In the provided code:\n   - `amount` (which corresponds to `principal`) is set to 1000.\n   - `deposit_rate` (which corresponds to `rate`) is set to 5.\n   - `investment_period` (which corresponds to `years`) is set to 10.\n\n4. If we change the `deposit_rate` from 5 to another value, say 10, the calculation will be different because the `rate` is directly multiplied with the `principal` and `years` in the formula.\n\n5. For example:\n   - With `rate` as 5, the interest calculated would be \\(1000 \\times (5/100) \\times 10 = 500\\), making the final amount \\(1000 + 500 = 1500\\).\n   - If we change `rate` to 10, the interest would be \\(1000 \\times (10/100) \\times 10 = 1000\\), making the final amount \\(1000 + 1000 = 2000\\).\n\n6.

The total amount is then calculated as:\n   \\[ \\text{total\\_amount} = \\text{principal} + \\text{interest} \\]\n4. In the provided example:\n   - Principal (amount) = 1000\n   - Rate (deposit_rate) = 5%\n   - Years (investment_period) = 10\n\n5.

    "To determine whether changing the 'deposit_rate' affects 'final_amount', let's break down the function and analyze the relationship between these variables.\n\n1. **Function Analysis**:\n   - The `calculate_interest` function calculates the final amount after a certain period based on the principal, rate, and years.\n   - The formula used is: \\( \\text{interest} = \\text{principal} \\times (\\text{rate} / 100) \\times \\text{years} \\)\n   - The final amount is then calculated as: \\( \\text{total\\_amount} = \\text{principal} + \\text{interest} \\)\n\n2. **Variables Involved**:\n   - **Principal**: The initial amount of money.\n   - **Rate**: The interest rate per year.\n   - **Years**: The duration for which the money is invested.\n   - **Final Amount**: The total amount after the specified period, including interest.\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - **deposit_rate → final_amount**: Yes, the interest rate directly influences the interest earned, which in turn affects the final amount.\n   - **principal → final_amount**: Yes, the principal amount is added to the interest to get the final amount.\n   - **years → final_amount**: Yes, the number of years determines how long the interest is applied, thus affecting the final amount.\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - If the `deposit_rate` increases, the interest earned over the given period will also increase, leading to a higher `final_amount`.\n   - Conversely, if the `deposit_rate` decreases, the interest earned will decrease, resulting in a lower `final_amount`.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that changing the `deposit_rate` does indeed affect the `final_amount`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
