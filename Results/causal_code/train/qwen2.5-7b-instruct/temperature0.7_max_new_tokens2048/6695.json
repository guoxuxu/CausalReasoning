    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `willItRain` method in the `WeatherController` class checks two conditions:\n   - It must be cloudy (`isCloudy == true`).\n   - The temperature must be less than 20.\n\n2. If it rained today, we know that the `willItRain` method returned `true`.\n\n3. For `willItRain` to return `true`, both conditions must be met:\n   - The weather must be cloudy.\n   - The temperature must be less than 20.\n\n4. However, if only one of these conditions were met, `willItRain` would still return `false`.\n\n5. Since we know it rained, we can confirm that both conditions were met when the `willItRain` method was called.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that the temperature was indeed below 20 at the time it rained, because that was one of the conditions for it to rain according to the `willItRain` method.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If it rained today, according to the `willItRain` method, both of these conditions must have been true at the time.\n\n3. However, the question asks if we can infer that the temperature was below 20 without any other information.\n\n4. There is no guarantee that it had to rain for the temperature to be below 20. The `willItRain` method only returns true if both conditions are met, but it doesn't mean that the conditions were met for it to rain.\n\n5. Therefore, just knowing that it rained does not give us enough information to conclude that the temperature was definitely below 20.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

However, just because it rained doesn't necessarily mean the temperature was below 20 at all times. It could have been above 20 at some point and then dropped below 20 later, leading to rain.\n\n7.
