    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_discount` takes two parameters: `price` and `coupon_code`.\n\n2. It checks if the `coupon_code` is 'SAVE20':\n   - If true, it sets `discount` to 0.2 (which means a 20% discount).\n\n3. If the `coupon_code` is not 'SAVE20', it checks if it's 'OFF10':\n   - If true, it sets `discount` to 0.1 (which means a 10% discount).\n\n4. If neither condition is met, no discount is applied.\n\n5. The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n\n6. For 'SAVE20', the discount is 0.2, which means the final price will be:\n   - `final_price = price * (1 - 0.2) = price * 0.8`\n   - This results in an 80% of the original price, meaning a 20% decrease.\n\nTherefore, applying a 'SAVE20' coupon code does indeed result in a decreased final price.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_discount` takes two parameters: `price` and `coupon_code`.\n\n2.
