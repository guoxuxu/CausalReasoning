    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - `mySchool` is an instance of `School` with 400 students and 20 teachers.\n   - The initial performance is calculated as `400 / 20 = 20`.\n\n2. **Change in Number of Teachers**:\n   - The method `increaseTeachers(5)` is called, which increases the number of teachers by 5.\n   - New number of teachers = 20 + 5 = 25.\n   - The performance is recalculated as `400 / 25 = 16`.\n\n3. **Effect on Performance**:\n   - Initially, the performance was 20.\n   - After increasing the number of teachers to 25, the performance changes to 16.\n\n4. **Question Analysis**:\n   - The question asks if the performance index changes when more students are enrolled without changing the number of teachers.\n   - From the current state, we see that increasing the number of teachers directly affects the performance, not the number of students.\n\nSince the performance index is recalculated based on the ratio of students to teachers, and the number of students did not change while the number of teachers increased, the performance index would indeed change.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - `mySchool` is an instance of the `School` class.\n   - Initially, `mySchool.students = 400` and `mySchool.teachers = 20`.\n   - The performance is calculated as `students.length / teachers.length`, which is `400 / 20 = 20`.\n\n2. **Increase Teachers**:\n   - The method `increaseTeachers(5)` is called on `mySchool`.\n   - This increases the number of teachers to `20 + 5 = 25`.\n   - The performance is recalculated as `400 / 25 = 16`.\n\n3. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if the performance index changes if we increase the number of students without changing the number of teachers.\n   - If we add more students but keep the number of teachers at 25, the new performance would be `new_students_length / 25`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since adding more students will increase the numerator in the performance calculation formula, the performance index will indeed change.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
