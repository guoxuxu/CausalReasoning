    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The person's age is 55, which is greater than 50.\n2. The daily steps are fewer than 5000 (specifically, less than 5000).\n3. The heart rate is 105.\n\nNow, let's look at the `is_at_risk` method in the code:\n\n1. It checks if the age is greater than 50 AND the daily steps are less than 5000.\n2. If both conditions are true, it then checks if the heart rate is greater than 100.\n3. If all these conditions are met, it returns True, meaning the person is classified as 'At risk'.\n\nGiven the conditions:\n- Age: 55 (greater than 50)\n- Daily steps: fewer than 5000 (less than 5000)\n- Heart rate: 105 (greater than 100)\n\nAll conditions for being 'At risk' are met.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
