    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `calculate_discount` function determines the discount based on the `day_of_week` and `item_category`.\n2. For `day_of_week = 'Wednesday'`:\n   - If `item_category` is 'Electronics', the discount is 20%.\n   - Otherwise, the discount is 5%.\n\n3. For any other day (not 'Wednesday'):\n   - If `item_category` is 'Electronics', the discount is 10%.\n   - Otherwise, the discount is 0%.\n\n4. We need to determine if a 0% discount implies it's not 'Wednesday'.\n\n5. From the rules defined in the function:\n   - A 0% discount can occur on any day for non-'Electronics' items.\n   - It can also occur on 'Wednesday' for non-'Electronics' items.\n\n6. Therefore, a 0% discount does not definitively rule out 'Wednesday' as the current day. It could be 'Wednesday' but for a non-'Electronics' item.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is no, we cannot definitively assume that today is not 'Wednesday' just because the discount is 0%.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
