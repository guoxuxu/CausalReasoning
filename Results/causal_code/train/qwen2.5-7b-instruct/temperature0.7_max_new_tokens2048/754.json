    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `calculate_sales` function takes three parameters: `price`, `demand`, and `marketing_spend`.\n\n2. The formula for calculating `sales` is:\n   \\[ \\text{sales} = \\text{price} \\times \\text{demand} \\]\n\n3. The formula for `marketing_effectiveness` is:\n   \\[ \\text{marketing\\_effectiveness} = \\text{marketing\\_spend}^{0.5} \\]\n\n4. The formula for `adjusted_sales` (which is the final output) is:\n   \\[ \\text{adjusted\\_sales} = \\text{sales} + (\\text{marketing\\_effectiveness} \\times 100) \\]\n   Substituting the earlier formulas, we get:\n   \\[ \\text{adjusted\\_sales} = (\\text{price} \\times \\text{demand}) + ((\\text{marketing\\_spend}^{0.5}) \\times 100) \\]\n\n5. Now, if we hold `demand` constant and increase `marketing_spend`, let's analyze how it affects `adjusted_sales`:\n   - Since `demand` is constant, increasing `marketing_spend` will only affect the second term of the `adjusted_sales` equation.\n   - The term \\(\\text{marketing\\_effectiveness} = \\text{marketing\\_spend}^{0.5}\\) increases as `marketing_spend` increases because the square root function is monotonically increasing.\n   - Multiplying this increased `marketing_effectiveness` by 100 will also increase the value.\n\n6. Therefore, since both terms in the `adjusted_sales` equation are positively affected by an increase in `marketing_spend` (the first term due to the direct relationship and the second term due to the positive relationship with the square root of `marketing_spend`), increasing `marketing_spend` will indeed lead to an increase in `adjusted_sales`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `calculate_sales` function computes the `adjusted_sales` based on the formula:\n   - `sales = price * demand`\n   - `marketing_effectiveness = marketing_spend ** 0.5`\n   - `adjusted_sales = sales + marketing_effectiveness * 100`\n\n2. The key component here is `marketing_effectiveness = marketing_spend ** 0.5`. This means that the effectiveness of marketing spend increases with the square root of the marketing spend.\n\n3. If we increase the marketing spend while holding demand constant:\n   - The `price` remains the same.\n   - The `demand` remains the same.\n   - The `marketing_effectiveness` will increase because it is proportional to the square root of `marketing_spend`.\n\n4. Since `adjusted_sales` is the sum of `sales` (which depends on `price` and `demand`) and `marketing_effectiveness * 100`, and since `marketing_effectiveness` increases with increasing `marketing_spend`, the `adjusted_sales` should also increase.\n\n5. However, it's important to note that the relationship is not linear due to the square root function. A small increase in `marketing_spend` might result in a larger relative increase in `marketing_effectiveness` compared to a large increase in `marketing_spend`.\n\nGiven these points, if we increase the marketing spend while keeping demand constant, we can expect an increase in `final_sales`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The key part of the function is how `adjusted_sales` is calculated:\n   - `marketing_effectiveness = marketing_spend ** 0.5`\n   - `adjusted_sales = sales + marketing_effectiveness * 100`\n\n4. If we hold `demand` constant and increase `marketing_spend`, let's analyze what happens to `adjusted_sales`:\n   - `sales` remains unchanged because `demand` is constant.\n   - `marketing_effectiveness` increases as `marketing_spend` increases (since it's the square root of `marketing_spend`).\n   - Therefore, `marketing_effectiveness * 100` will also increase.\n\n5. Since `adjusted_sales` is the sum of `sales` and `marketing_effectiveness * 100`, and both terms are positively affected by increasing `marketing_spend`, `adjusted_sales` will indeed increase.\n\n6. However, the relationship is not linear due to the square root function. The effect of increased `marketing_spend` on `adjusted_sales` will diminish as `marketing_spend` gets larger.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if we hold `demand` constant and increase `marketing_spend`, `final_sales` (which is equivalent to `adjusted_sales` in this context) will increase.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The `marketing_effectiveness` is calculated as `marketing_spend ** 0.5`, which is the square root of `marketing_spend`.\n\n4. The `adjusted_sales` is then calculated by adding `marketing_effectiveness * 100` to the initial `sales`.\n\n5. Now, let's consider what happens when we increase `marketing_spend` while holding `demand` constant.\n\n6. As `marketing_spend` increases, its square root (`marketing_effectiveness`) also increases, albeit at a slower rate (since the square root function grows more slowly as its input gets larger).\n\n7.

Finally, the `adjusted_sales` is calculated as:\n   - `adjusted_sales = sales + marketing_effectiveness * 100`\n   - Substituting the values, `adjusted_sales = 500 + 20 * 100 = 500 + 2000 = 2500`\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we increase `marketing_spend` while keeping `demand` constant:\n\n5.
