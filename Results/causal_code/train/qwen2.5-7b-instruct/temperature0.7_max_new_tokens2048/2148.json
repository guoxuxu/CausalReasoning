    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1.

We are asked if a high skill level can be inferred from only the fact that `skill_level` is 'high'.\n\n3. From the conditions above, we see that:\n   - A `skill_level` of 'high' directly corresponds to `experience > 8`.\n\n4.

Therefore, while a high skill level indicates that the experience is greater than 8, it does not necessarily mean that experience is greater than 8 exclusively. It could also be exactly 8 or any value between 5 and 8 that still qualifies as 'high'.\n\n5. The question asks if we can infer that experience is necessarily greater than 8 based solely on a high skill level.

It could also mean that `7 < experience <= 8`.\n\n3. **Final Salary Calculation**:\n   - The final salary depends on the `skill_level` and `base_salary`.\n   - If `skill_level = 'high'`, the final salary is increased by 2%.\n   - This condition is met if `experience > 8`, but not exclusively.\n\nGiven these points, we cannot infer that `experience` is necessarily greater than 8 just because the `skill_level` is `'high'`.
