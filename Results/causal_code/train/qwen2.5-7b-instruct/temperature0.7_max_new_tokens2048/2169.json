    "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a list of numbers `data` as input.\n2. It calculates `data_squared`, which is each element in `data` squared.\n3. It calculates `data_multiplied`, which is each element in `data` multiplied by `base`.\n4. It then sums up all elements in `data_squared` to get `sum_squared`.\n5. Similarly, it sums up all elements in `data_multiplied` to get `sum_multiplied`.\n6. Finally, it returns the sum of `sum_squared` and `sum_multiplied`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if we increase the value of `base`:\n- Increasing `base` will increase each element in `data_multiplied`.\n- Since `sum_multiplied` is the sum of these elements, increasing `base` will increase `sum_multiplied`.\n- `sum_squared` remains unchanged because it only depends on the original values in `data` and not on `base`.\n\nTherefore, since both `sum_squared` and `sum_multiplied` are added together to get `final_value`, and `sum_multiplied` increases with `base`, the `final_value` will also increase when `base` is increased.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
