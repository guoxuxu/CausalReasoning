We need to check the conditions inside the `changeWeather` method:\n   - If `newTemp > 30`, then `isRaining` is set to true and `temperature` is set to `newTemp - 5`.\n   - If `rain` is true, then `temperature` is set to `newTemp + 10` and `isRaining` is set to true.\n   - Otherwise, `temperature` is set to `newTemp` and `isRaining` is set to false.\n\n4. Since `newTemp` is 35 (which is greater than 30) and `rain` is false, we follow the first condition:\n   - `isRaining` is set to true.\n   - `temperature` is set to `newTemp - 5`, which is `35 - 5 = 30`.\n\n5.
