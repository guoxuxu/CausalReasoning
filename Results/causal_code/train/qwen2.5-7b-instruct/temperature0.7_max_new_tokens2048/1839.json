    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `predict_rain` method checks two conditions:\n   - Temperature is less than 50\n   - Humidity is greater than 50\n\n2. We need to check if setting the temperature to 45 and humidity to 55 would satisfy these conditions.\n\n3. For the first condition (temperature < 50):\n   - Setting temperature to 45 satisfies this condition because 45 is indeed less than 50.\n\n4. For the second condition (humidity > 50):\n   - Setting humidity to 55 satisfies this condition because 55 is indeed greater than 50.\n\n5.
