    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Functions:**\n   - `weather_condition()` returns one of three possible weather conditions: sunny, rainy, or cloudy.\n   - `decide_outfit(weather)` decides the outfit based on the weather condition:\n     - If it's sunny, the outfit is a t-shirt.\n     - If it's rainy, the outfit is a raincoat.\n     - If it's cloudy, the outfit is a sweater.\n\n2. **Given Information:**\n   - The problem specifically states that if the weather is rainy, the outfit will be a raincoat.\n\n3. **Causal Relationship:**\n   - The causal relationship given is `weather → outfit`, which means the weather directly influences the choice of outfit.\n   - Additionally, there's another relationship `current_weather → outfit` indicating that the current weather (which is determined by `weather_condition()`) is what determines the outfit.\n\n4. **Scenario Analysis:**\n   - If the weather is rainy (`current_weather == 'rainy'`), according to the function `decide_outfit`, the outfit will be a raincoat.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the direct mapping in the function `decide_outfit`, if the weather is rainy, the outfit will indeed be a raincoat.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
