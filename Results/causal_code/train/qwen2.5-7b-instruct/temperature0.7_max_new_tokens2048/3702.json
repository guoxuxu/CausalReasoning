    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial value of `temperature` is set to 25.\n2. The initial value of `airConditioningOn` is set to false.\n3. The first if statement checks if `temperature > 22`.\n   - Since `temperature` is 25, which is indeed greater than 22, this condition evaluates to true.\n4. Because the condition is true, `airConditioningOn` is set to true.\n5. The second if statement checks if `timeOfDay > 18`.\n   - The value of `timeOfDay` is 15, which is not greater than 18.\n6. Since the second condition is false, `airConditioningOn` remains true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given code snippet, if the temperature is greater than 22 degrees, the air conditioning will be turned on.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
