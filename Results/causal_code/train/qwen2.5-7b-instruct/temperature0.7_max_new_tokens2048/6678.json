    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the functions:**\n   - `process_data(data)`: This function takes an input `data`, multiplies it by 2, and returns the result.\n   - `compute_results(x)`: This function takes an input `x`, passes it to `process_data()`, and then adds 5 to the result from `process_data()`.\n\n2. **Breaking down the computation:**\n   - For any input `x`:\n     - `y = process_data(x)` results in `y = x * 2`.\n     - `result = y + 5` becomes `result = (x * 2) + 5`.\n\n3. **Analyzing the relationship between `input_value` and `final_result`:**\n   - If we denote the `input_value` as `x`, then:\n     - `y = x * 2`\n     - `result = (x * 2) + 5`\n   - Therefore, `final_result = (input_value * 2) + 5`.\n\n4. **Considering the effect of increasing `input_value`:**\n   - If `input_value` increases, say from `x` to `x'` where `x' > x`:\n     - The new `y' = x' * 2`\n     - The new `result' = (x' * 2) + 5`\n   - Since multiplication by 2 and addition of 5 are both linear operations, if `x' > x`, then `(x' * 2) > (x * 2)`, and consequently, `(x' * 2) + 5 > (x * 2) + 5`.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Increasing `input_value` directly leads to an increase in `final_result`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding `process_data` function**:\n   - It takes an input `data`.\n   - Multiplies it by 2.\n   - Returns the adjusted data.\n\n2. **Understanding `compute_results` function**:\n   - Takes an input `x`.\n   - Calls `process_data(x)` which doubles `x` to get `y`.\n   - Adds 5 to `y` to get the `result`.\n\n3. **Expression for `final_result`**:\n   - `final_result = 2 * x + 5`\n\n4. **Effect of increasing `input_value` (x)**:\n   - If we increase `x`, then `2 * x` will also increase proportionally.\n   - Adding 5 to a larger number will still result in a larger number overall.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both terms in the expression `2 * x + 5` are directly proportional to `x` (the first term) and constant (the second term), increasing `x` will indeed increase the final result.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Input Value**: The initial value of `input_value` is 10.\n2. **Process Data Function**:\n   - `adjusted_data = data * 2`\n   - For `input_value`, `y = process_data(input_value)` would be `y = 10 * 2 = 20`.\n3. **Compute Results Function**:\n   - `result = y + 5`\n   - Substituting the value of `y` from the previous step, we get `result = 20 + 5 = 25`.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of increasing `input_value`:\n\n4. **Increased Input Value**: Suppose `input_value` is increased to some new value, say `x_new > 10`.\n5. **New Process Data Function**:\n   - `y_new = process_data(x_new)` would be `y_new = x_new * 2`.\n6. **New Compute Results Function**:\n   - `result_new = y_new + 5`\n   - Substituting the new value of `y_new`, we get `result_new = x_new * 2 + 5`.\n\nSince `x_new > 10`, it follows that `x_new * 2 > 20`, and therefore `x_new * 2 + 5 > 25`.
