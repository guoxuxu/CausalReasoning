    "Let's break down the logic of the `makePurchase` method to determine if a customer's purchase amount will be reduced when it exceeds the discount threshold.\n\n1. The method `makePurchase(int purchaseAmount)` takes an integer parameter representing the purchase amount.\n2. It checks if the `purchaseAmount` is greater than or equal to the `discountThreshold`.\n3. If the condition is true, it sets `discountActive` to `true`.\n4. Then, it checks if `discountActive` is `true`.\n5. If `discountActive` is `true`, it applies a 10% discount to the `purchaseAmount` by multiplying it by 0.9.\n6. Finally, it adds the adjusted purchase amount to `totalSales`.\n\nGiven this sequence of operations, we can conclude that if a customer's purchase amount exceeds the discount threshold, their purchase amount will indeed be reduced by 10% due to the active discount.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The discounted amount (if applicable) is then added to `totalSales`.\n\nGiven this logic, if a customer makes a purchase that exceeds the `discountThreshold`, the purchase amount will indeed be reduced by 10% due to the discount being applied immediately after the condition is met.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
