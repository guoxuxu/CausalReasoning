    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `addItem` method takes a single parameter: `price`.\n\n2. Inside the `addItem` method:\n   - `itemCount` is incremented by 1.\n   - `totalPrice` is increased by the `price` passed as an argument.\n\n3. The question specifically asks about a positive price being passed to `addItem`.\n\n4. If a positive price is passed:\n   - `itemCount` will increase by 1 (which is always a positive change).\n   - `totalPrice` will be increased by the positive `price` value.\n\n5. Since both `itemCount` and `totalPrice` are affected positively by a call to `addItem` with a positive price, the `totalPrice` will indeed increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
