  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Applying a discount is an intervention that directly reduces the total cost as the total is multiplied by (1 - discount rate), thus effectively reducing the total amount payable. This directly tests causality from cause (discount application) to effect (reduced total) with an intervention.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `apply_discount` method in the `ShoppingCart` class takes a `discount` parameter.\n2. This method multiplies the current total (`self.total`) by `(1 - discount)`.\n3. For example, if the current total is $100 and we apply a 10% discount, the calculation would be:\n   - 100 * (1 - 0.10) = 100 * 0.90 = 90\n4. The result of this calculation is a new total that is less than the original total.\n5.
