  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Since the update function calculates the new score by adding the bonus to the initial score and subtracting the penalty, if there is no bonus (bonus = 0), the new score solely decreases by the penalty amount.",
  "causal_map": "bonus → new_score; penalty → new_score",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `update_score(score, bonus, penalty)` takes three parameters:\n   - `score`: The initial score.\n   - `bonus`: A value to add to the score.\n   - `penalty`: A value to subtract from the score.\n\n2. If no bonus is provided, the `bonus` parameter would be `0`.\n\n3. The calculation inside the function is:\n   ```python\n   new_score = score + bonus - penalty\n   ```\n\n4. If we set `bonus` to `0`, the equation simplifies to:\n   ```python\n   new_score = score - penalty\n   ```\n\n5. Given that `penalty` is always a positive value (assuming it represents a deduction), subtracting it from the score will indeed result in a lower score.\n\n6. Therefore, if no bonus is provided (i.e., `bonus` is `0`), the score will only decrease due to the penalty.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
