  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by modifying data_sequence to only include values greater than 8 ensures that all values in processed_data, being tripled, are significantly high (all greater than 24), thereby increasing the average computed in analyze_data. This is a direct result of the intervention leading to higher values being fed into the process_data function.",
