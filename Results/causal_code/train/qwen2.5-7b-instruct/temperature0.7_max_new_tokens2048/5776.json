    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Environment` class has an `__init__` method that initializes with a given temperature.\n2. If the temperature is 25, the `condition` attribute is set to 'normal'. Otherwise, it's set to 'extreme'.\n3. The `Animal` class has an `__init__` method that takes an `environment` object and determines the `activity_level` based on the environment's condition.\n4. If the environment's condition is 'extreme', the `activity_level` is set to 'low'. Otherwise, it's set to 'high'.\n5. In the provided code:\n   - An `Environment` object is created with a temperature of 30.\n   - This environment object is then passed to an `Animal` object.\n6. Given that the environment's temperature is 30 (which is greater than 25), the environment's condition would be set to 'extreme'.\n7. Since the environment's condition is 'extreme', the `determine_activity` method will return 'low'.\n\nNow, if the animal's activity level is observed to be 'low', we know from the logic above that the environment must have a condition of 'extreme', which means the temperature must be greater than 25.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
