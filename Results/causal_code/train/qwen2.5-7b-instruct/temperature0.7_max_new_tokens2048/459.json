    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `TrafficSystem` class has two attributes:\n   - `signal`: an integer representing the traffic signal state.\n   - `isRaining`: a boolean indicating whether it is raining.\n\n2. In the constructor, based on the value of `isRaining`, the initial value of `signal` is set:\n   - If it's raining, `signal` is set to 1 (red).\n   - If it's not raining, `signal` is set to 0 (green).\n\n3. The `manualOverride` method allows changing the `signal` value directly:\n   - `public void manualOverride(int newSignal) { signal = newSignal; }`\n\n4. The `getTrafficStatus` method returns a value based on the current `signal`:\n   - If `signal` is 1, it returns 5, indicating heavy traffic.\n   - If `signal` is 0, it returns 1, indicating light traffic.\n\n5. To answer the question: Would manually overriding the signal to green (which would be represented by `0`) reduce the traffic status to light traffic?\n\n   - Yes, because when `signal` is set to 0, `getTrafficStatus` returns 1, which indicates light traffic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
