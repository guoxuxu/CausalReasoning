    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes two parameters: `data` (a dictionary) and `add_factor` (a boolean).\n\n2. If `add_factor` is True, each value in the dictionary is multiplied by 2.\n\n3. We're given that the output is {'apple': 100, 'banana': 60}.\n\n4. To get this output, we need to determine what input would result in these values when multiplied by 2.\n\n5. For 'apple': 100 / 2 = 50\n   For 'banana': 60 / 2 = 30\n\n6.

The provided call to the function is:\n   ```python\n   result = process_data({'apple': 50, 'banana': 30}, True)\n   ```\n\n7.
