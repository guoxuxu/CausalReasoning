    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The 'increaseHeat' method has two branches based on the source parameter:\n   - If source is 'solar'\n   - If source is 'geothermal'\n\n2.

Adding 10 to the humidity is a definite action that will always occur when the 'solar' source is used.\n\n5. There are no conditions or exceptions that would prevent the humidity from increasing when 'solar' is the source.\n\nTherefore, the humidity will always increase when the 'increaseHeat' method is invoked with 'solar'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The question specifically asks about the scenario when 'solar' is passed as the source.\n4. In this case, the humidity does indeed increase by 10.\n\nGiven that the method explicitly increases humidity by 10 when 'solar' is provided as the source, we can conclude that the humidity will always increase in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

There are no conditions that would prevent the humidity from increasing when the `increaseHeat` method is called with `'solar'`.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that the humidity will always increase by 10 when the `increaseHeat` method is invoked with `'solar'`, because there are no conditions provided that would prevent this.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `increaseHeat` method with the source 'solar' increases the temperature by 5 and the humidity by 10.\n2. There is no conditional check in the `increaseHeat` method that directly relates to the humidity after the 'solar' source is used.\n3. The only condition provided in the code that affects humidity is when the temperature is less than 18, which would then decrease the humidity by 20.\n4. When the `increaseHeat` method with 'solar' is called, the temperature and humidity changes immediately without any further conditions affecting the humidity until the `decreaseTemperature` method is called.\n\nGiven this information, the humidity will indeed increase by 10 when the `increaseHeat` method is called with 'solar'.

For 'solar' source, the method increases:\n   - Temperature by 5\n   - Humidity by 10\n3. The question asks if the humidity will always increase when 'solar' is used.\n4. From the provided code, we can see that for 'solar', the humidity is explicitly increased by 10.\n5. There are no conditions that would prevent this increase from happening.\n6.

There is no conditional check for humidity based on the temperature after increasing it with 'solar'.\n4. The only condition affecting humidity is `temperature < 18 → humidity -= 20`, which is not relevant here since we are only considering the effect of 'solar'.\n\nGiven that the `humidity` is explicitly increased by 10 when the `increaseHeat` method is called with 'solar', and there are no conditions that would decrease it under these circumstances, the humidity will always increase by 10 when the `increaseHeat` method is invoked with 'solar'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The only condition that affects humidity is when the temperature is less than 18, which would decrease humidity by 20.\n5. Since the initial temperature is set to 20, increasing it by 5 with the 'solar' source will not make the temperature drop below 18.\n\nGiven these points, the humidity will always increase by 10 when the `increaseHeat` method is called with 'solar', as there is no condition that would negate this increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
