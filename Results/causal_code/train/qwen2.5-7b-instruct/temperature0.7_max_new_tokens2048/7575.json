    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original function computes the `final_score` using both `age_score` and `test_score`.\n\n2. The formula for `final_score` is:\n   ```\n   final_score = age_score + test_score\n   ```\n\n3. Where:\n   - `age_score = data['age'] * age_weight`\n   - `test_score = data['test_score'] * score_weight`\n\n4. If we set `score_weight` to 1 and disregard `age_weight`, the formula simplifies to:\n   ```\n   final_score = (data['age'] * 0) + (data['test_score'] * 1)\n   ```\n\n5. Simplifying further:\n   ```\n   final_score = 0 + data['test_score']\n   final_score = data['test_score']\n   ```\n\n6. This means that `final_score` would now be directly equal to `data['test_score']`, making it solely dependent on the `test_score`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
