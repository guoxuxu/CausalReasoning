  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Changing the 'is_holiday' from False to True increases the discount from 0.05 to 0.15. This higher discount rate decreases the final_price because the price is being reduced by a greater percentage.",
  "causal_map": "is_holiday → discount; discount → final_price",
  "causal_map_integration": "When is_holiday changes from False to True, discount increases, which decreases final_price.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - When `is_holiday` is `False`, the discount is 0.05.\n   - The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - 0.05)`, which simplifies to `price * 0.95`.\n\n2. **Holiday Condition**:\n   - When `is_holiday` is `True`, the discount is 0.15.\n   - The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - 0.15)`, which simplifies to `price * 0.85`.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - Without a holiday (discount = 0.05), the final price is 95% of the original price.\n   - With a holiday (discount = 0.15), the final price is 85% of the original price.\n\nSince 85% is less than 95%, changing `is_holiday` from `False` to `True` results in a lower final price.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
