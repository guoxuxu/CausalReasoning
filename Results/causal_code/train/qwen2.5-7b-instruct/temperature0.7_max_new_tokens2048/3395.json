    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The base price is 100.\n2. The final price after discounts is 90.\n\nThis means the total discount applied is 10 (100 - 90).\n\n3. Let's consider the possible discounts:\n   - Age discount: 20 if age < 18, 0 otherwise.\n   - Student discount: 10 if student, 0 otherwise.\n   - Coupon discount: 30 if coupon_code is 'SAVE30', 0 otherwise.\n\n4. To get a final price of 90, the total discount must be 10.\n5. If the student discount was 10, then the remaining discount would need to be 0, which could be achieved by either no age discount or no coupon discount.\n6. If the student discount was 0, then the total discount would need to be 10 from other sources, which isn't possible since the maximum age discount is 20 and the maximum coupon discount is 30.\n\nTherefore, for the final price to be 90, the student discount must have been applied.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The base price is $100.\n2. We need to determine what could cause the final price to be $90.\n\nGiven:\n- Final price = Base price - Age discount - Student discount - Coupon discount\n- Final price = $90\n\nThis means:\n$90 = $100 - Age discount - Student discount - Coupon discount\n\nLet's consider possible combinations of discounts that could lead to a final price of $90:\n\n1. If there was no student discount (student_discount = 0) and no coupon discount (coupon_discount = 0), then:\n   $90 = $100 - Age discount\n   Age discount must be $10. Since age_discount = 20 if age < 18, this implies the person is under 18.\n\n2. If there was a student discount (student_discount = 10) and no coupon discount (coupon_discount = 0), then:\n   $90 = $100 - Age discount - 10\n   Age discount must be $20. This again implies the person is under 18.\n\n3. If there was a coupon discount (coupon_discount = 30) and no student discount (student_discount = 0), then:\n   $90 = $100 - Age discount - 30\n   Age discount must be $20. This again implies the person is under 18.\n\n4. If there was both a student discount (student_discount = 10) and a coupon discount (coupon_discount = 30), then:\n   $90 = $100 - Age discount - 10 - 30\n   Age discount must be $20. Again, this implies the person is under 18.\n\nIn all these scenarios, the person can still be under 18 and not necessarily a student. The student discount is only applied if the parameter `student` is True.\n\nTherefore, the final price being $90 does not necessarily imply that the person is a student.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `price_calculator` function to determine if the final price being 90 necessarily implies that the person is a student.\n\n1. **Base Price**: The base price is set to 100.\n2. **Age Discount**: \n   - If age < 18, there's a 20 discount.\n   - Otherwise, there's no discount.\n3. **Student Discount**: \n   - If the person is a student (student=True), there's a 10 discount.\n   - Otherwise, there's no discount.\n4. **Coupon Discount**: \n   - If the coupon code is 'SAVE30', there's a 30 discount.\n   - Otherwise, there's no discount.\n5. **Final Price Calculation**:\n   - Final Price = Base Price - Age Discount - Student Discount - Coupon Discount\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the final price is 90:\n\n- If there's a 20 age discount (age < 18), the calculation would be:\n  \\[\n  100 - 20 - 10 - 0 = 70 \\quad (\\text{if student=False and no coupon})\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  100 - 20 - 0 - 30 = 50 \\quad (\\text{if student=True and no coupon})\n  \\]\n  Neither of these scenarios results in a final price of 90.\n  \n- If there's no age discount (age ≥ 18), the calculation would be:\n  \\[\n  100 - 0 - 10 - 30 = 60 \\quad (\\text{if student=True and no age discount, no coupon})\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  100 - 0 - 0 - 30 = 70 \\quad (\\text{if no student and no age discount, no coupon})\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  100 - 0 - 10 - 0 = 90 \\quad (\\text{if student=True and no age discount, no coupon})\n  \\]\n\nFrom this breakdown, we can see that the final price being 90 can only occur if the person is a student (with no age discount and no coupon). Therefore, it does necessarily imply that the person is a student.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
