    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `increase_temperature` method increases the current temperature by a specified amount (`increment`).\n2. If adding the increment would cause the current temperature to exceed the maximum temperature (`max_temp`), it sets the current temperature to `max_temp`.\n3. If the increment would not cause an overflow, it simply adds the increment to the current temperature.\n4. There is no limit to how many times `increase_temperature` can be called without a corresponding call to `decrease_temperature`.\n\nGiven these points, let's consider what happens when we repeatedly call `increase_temperature`:\n\n- Each call to `increase_temperature` will try to increase the current temperature by the specified amount.\n- If the new temperature exceeds `max_temp`, it is clamped to `max_temp`.\n- If the new temperature does not exceed `max_temp`, it is increased accordingly.\n\nSince there is no upper bound on the number of times `increase_temperature` can be called, and each call tries to increase the temperature as much as possible (up to `max_temp`), it follows that if we keep calling `increase_temperature` without ever calling `decrease_temperature`, the temperature will continue to approach `max_temp` until it reaches `max_temp`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nThe current temperature will always reach the `max_temp` if `increase_temperature` is called repeatedly without any calls to `decrease_temperature`.",

If it would exceed, the current temperature is set to `max_temp`.\n   - This means that once the current temperature reaches `max_temp`, it will stay there unless decreased.\n\n3. If it wouldn't exceed, the current temperature is increased by the increment amount.\n\n4. There is no mechanism in the code provided for resetting the temperature back below `max_temp` after reaching it.\n\n5. Therefore, if `increase_temperature` is called repeatedly with increments that do not cause an immediate overflow (i.e., the sum of all increments does not exceed `max_temp`), the temperature will continue to increase until it reaches `max_temp`.\n\n6. Once at `max_temp`, subsequent calls to `increase_temperature` will not change the temperature further.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that if `increase_temperature` is called repeatedly without any calls to `decrease_temperature`, the current temperature will indeed always reach `max_temp` and remain at that value.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
