Increasing `inputB` would increase the intermediate `tempResult` but not as dramatically as changing `inputA`.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that the result is significantly high after adding 10 to `inputA`, it does not necessarily mean that `inputB` was high.

The new result is 66, which is indeed higher than the original result of 60.\n\n8.

The relationship between `inputB` and `result` is linear through `tempResult`. If `inputB` were much higher, `tempResult` would be even larger, but the increase in `inputA` alone caused the significant increase in the result here.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that `inputB` was high just from observing a significant increase in the result after adding 10 to `inputA`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
