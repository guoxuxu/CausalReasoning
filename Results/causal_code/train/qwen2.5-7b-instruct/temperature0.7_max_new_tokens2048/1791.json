  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, rain is set to true only when it is cloudy and the humidity is above 50. Thus, if it has rained, it can be inferred that it was necessarily cloudy, as rain occurring due to other conditions isn't provided in the code.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Cloudiness and high humidity can cause rain, while low humidity can prevent rain. Rain directly causes the temperature to decrease by 5 degrees Celsius when it occurs.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `adjustWeather` method determines whether it rains based on two conditions:\n   - It must be cloudy (`cloudy == true`)\n   - The humidity must be greater than 50 (`humidity > 50`)\n\n2. If both of these conditions are met, then `rain` is set to `true`.\n\n3. However, if either condition is not met, `rain` is set to `false`, regardless of the current state of `cloudy`.\n\n4. This means that for rain to occur, it is necessary for the weather to be cloudy AND the humidity to be above 50.\n\n5. Therefore, if it rained, we can conclude that it was indeed cloudy at the time because one of the conditions for rain (being cloudy) had to be true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The causal relationship given is `cloudy → rain`, which means if it is cloudy, then it can rain.\n\n6. But we need to check if it is necessarily cloudy when it rains. From the code, we see that `rain` can only be `true` if `cloudy` is `true` and `humidity > 50`. This means that while `cloudy` is necessary for `rain` to occur, it is not sufficient on its own. There must also be high humidity.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if it rained, it was necessarily cloudy because the method does not allow rain without it being cloudy.

In this case:\n   - If it's not cloudy (`cloudy` is false), `rain` is set to false.\n   - If the humidity is less than 30 (`humidity < 30`), the temperature increases by 3 degrees, but there's no mention of setting `rain` to true or false in this scenario.\n\n4.
