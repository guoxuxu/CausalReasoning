    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_discount` takes three parameters:\n   - `prices`: A list of prices.\n   - `is_member`: A boolean indicating whether the user is a member.\n   - `promo_code`: A string representing the promotional code.\n\n2. The initial discount rate is set to 0.05 if the user is a member (`is_member` is True), otherwise it's set to 0.0.\n\n3. If the `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', the discount rate increases by an additional 0.2.\n\n4. The function then returns a list where each price is multiplied by `(1 - discount_rate)` to apply the discount.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where all items show a final reduced price by exactly 25%.\n\n- A 25% reduction means that the final price is 75% of the original price, i.e., `price * 0.75`.\n- This implies the discount rate used is 0.25.\n\nGiven the logic in the function:\n- If the user is a member (`is_member` is True), the base discount rate would be 0.05.\n- To get a total discount rate of 0.25, we need an additional 0.20 on top of the base 0.05, which is only possible if the `promo_code` 'SAVE20' is used.\n\nTherefore, if all items show a final reduced price by exactly 25%, we can conclude that the user is a member and used the promo code 'SAVE20'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the function**:\n   - `calculate_discount` takes three parameters: `prices`, `is_member`, and `promo_code`.\n   - If `is_member` is `True`, the initial discount rate is 5% (`0.05`).\n   - If `promo_code` is `'SAVE20'`, an additional 20% discount is applied.\n   - The function returns a list of discounted prices.\n\n2. **Calculating the total discount**:\n   - If `is_member` is `False` (not a member), the maximum discount rate would be 20% (`0.2`).\n   - If `is_member` is `True` and the promo code is `'SAVE20'`, the total discount rate becomes 25% (`0.25`).\n\n3. **Final price calculation**:\n   - For each price in `prices`, the function returns the price after applying the discount rate.\n   - If the final price is exactly 25% lower than the original price, the discount rate must be 25%.\n\n4. **Determining conditions**:\n   - A 25% discount means the discount rate is 0.25.\n   - This can only happen if both `is_member` is `True` and the `promo_code` is `'SAVE20'`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If all items show a final reduced price by exactly 25%, it implies that the discount rate used was 25%.\n   - The only way to achieve a 25% discount rate is when the user is a member and uses the promo code `'SAVE20'`.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the function `calculate_discount` to determine if we can conclude that the user is a member and used the promo code 'SAVE20' based on an overall 25% discount.\n\n1. **Discount Rate Calculation**:\n   - If `is_member` is `True`, the initial discount rate is set to `0.05` (5%).\n   - If `is_member` is `False`, the initial discount rate is `0.0` (no discount).\n\n2. **Promo Code Impact**:\n   - If the `promo_code` is `'SAVE20'`, the discount rate increases by `0.2` (20%).\n\n3. **Final Price Calculation**:\n   - The final price for each item is calculated as `price * (1 - discount_rate)`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where there is an overall 25% reduction applied to all prices:\n\n- A 25% discount means the final price is 75% of the original price (`0.75`).\n- This implies that the effective discount rate must be `0.25` (25%).\n\nGiven the function logic:\n- If `is_member` is `True`, the initial discount rate is `0.05`.\n- Adding the `SAVE20` promo code increases this to `0.25`.\n\nThis matches our requirement for a 25% discount.\n\nTherefore, if all items show a final reduced price by exactly 25%, it logically follows that the user must be a member (`is_member=True`) and have used the promo code `'SAVE20'`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Discount Calculation Based on Membership**:\n   - If `is_member` is `True`, the initial discount rate is 5% (`0.05`).\n   - If `is_member` is `False`, the initial discount rate is 0% (`0.0`).\n\n2. **Promo Code 'SAVE20'**:\n   - If the `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', an additional 20% discount is applied to the initial discount rate.\n   - This means the total discount rate becomes `0.05 + 0.2 = 0.25`.\n\n3. **Final Price Calculation**:\n   - The final price for each item is calculated as `price * (1 - discount_rate)`.\n   - With a total discount rate of `0.25`, the final price would be `price * (1 - 0.25) = price * 0.75`, which is a 25% reduction.\n\nGiven that all items show a final reduced price by exactly 25%, we can conclude that:\n- The user must have a membership status (`is_member`), leading to an initial 5% discount.\n- The user also used the promo code 'SAVE20', adding an additional 20% discount.\n\nTherefore, the user must be a member and have used the promo code 'SAVE20'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
