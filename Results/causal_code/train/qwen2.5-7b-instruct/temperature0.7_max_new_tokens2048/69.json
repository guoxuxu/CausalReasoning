    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `compute_stats` function calculates the mean and variance of a dataset.\n\n2. The mean is calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values (len(data)).\n\n3. When we increase the sample size, we are adding more data points to the dataset.\n\n4. Adding more data points can potentially change the sum of the values and the number of values.\n\n5. However, whether the mean changes depends on the new data points added:\n   - If the new data points are similar to the existing ones, the mean might not change significantly.\n   - If the new data points are very different from the existing ones, the mean could change significantly.\n\n6. In general, increasing the sample size does not guarantee that the mean will change, but it does make it more likely that the mean will be a better estimate of the true population mean.\n\n7. Therefore, while the mean might not necessarily change, it is possible for it to change when the sample size increases.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer to the question \"Will the computed mean necessarily change if the input data sample size increases?\" is no, because it is not guaranteed to change.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The mean is calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values (sample size).\n3. Increasing the sample size means adding more values to the dataset.\n4. When we add more values, the sum of the dataset changes, but the new mean will be recalculated as the new sum divided by the new, larger sample size.\n5. The exact change in the mean depends on the values added, but generally, if we add values that are close to the current mean, the mean might not change much. If we add values far from the current mean, the mean will shift.\n\nNow, considering the question specifically:\n- The mean is directly influenced by the addition of new values to the dataset.\n- Even if the new values are similar to the existing ones, the sample size has increased, which will affect the mean calculation.\n\nTherefore, increasing the sample size will necessarily change the mean unless the new values exactly match the existing mean and do not alter the total sum.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

When we add new values to the dataset:\n   - The numerator (sum of all values) will increase.\n   - The denominator (number of values) will also increase.\n5. The key point here is that both the numerator and the denominator are increasing, but the denominator is increasing at a faster rate if the new values are similar to the existing ones.\n6. Therefore, the ratio (mean) will generally decrease if the new values are less than the current mean, or stay relatively close to the current mean if the new values are similar.\n7. However, it is not guaranteed that the mean will necessarily change.

    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The formula for calculating the mean is:\n   mean = sum(data) / len(data)\n   Here, len(data) is the denominator, which directly affects the mean.\n\n2. For the variance calculation:\n   variance = sum(square_diffs) / len(data)\n   Again, len(data) appears in the denominator.\n\n3. If we increase the sample size (i.e., the number of elements in data), both the numerator and the denominator in the mean and variance formulas will be affected, but not necessarily in the same way.\n\n4. For the mean:\n   - Increasing the sample size means adding more terms to the sum in the numerator.\n   - However, each term is divided by the increased denominator.\n   - This means the mean could either increase, decrease, or remain the same, depending on the new values added.\n\n5. For the variance:\n   - The numerator (sum of squared differences) will also increase as more data points are added.\n   - But like the mean, it's divided by the larger denominator.\n   - Similar to the mean, the variance could increase, decrease, or stay the same.\n\n6. Specifically, if we add more data points that are close to the existing mean, the mean might not change much, but if we add extreme values, it could change significantly.\n\n7.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The mean is calculated as the sum of all data points divided by the number of data points (len(data)).\n2. When we increase the sample size (len(data)), the denominator in the mean calculation increases.\n3. If the sum of the data points remains constant, increasing the denominator will decrease the value of the mean.\n4. However, if the data points themselves change (e.g., new values are added that are significantly different from the existing ones), the mean could potentially stay the same or even change direction (increase or decrease).\n5. For the variance calculation, both the numerator (sum of squared differences) and the denominator (sample size) are affected by changes in len(data). But since the variance formula divides by len(data) directly, the relationship is more complex than just the simple division for the mean.\n6. In general, increasing the sample size tends to stabilize the mean towards the central tendency of the data, but it doesn't necessarily mean the mean will change.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that while increasing the sample size generally affects the mean, it does not necessarily change it.
