    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - The initial heart rate is set to 70.\n   \n2. **Water Consumption**:\n   - The `drink_water` method increases the `daily_water_intake` by the amount of liters passed as an argument.\n   - If the `daily_water_intake` exceeds 2 liters, the heart rate decreases by 5.\n\n3. **External Factor**:\n   - An external factor ensures that the person consumes exactly 3 liters of water daily.\n   - This means the `daily_water_intake` will be 3 liters after the consumption.\n\n4. **Effect on Heart Rate**:\n   - Since the `daily_water_intake` is 3 liters (which is greater than 2), the condition `if self.daily_water_intake > 2:` will be true.\n   - As a result, the heart rate will decrease by 5.\n\n5. **Exercise Routine**:\n   - The problem states that the exercise routine does not change, meaning the `exercise_minutes` remains unchanged.\n   - Therefore, the `exercise` method will not be called, and no changes will occur to the heart rate due to exercise.\n\nGiven this analysis, the heart rate will indeed decrease by 5 due to the increased water intake.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Therefore, the `exercise_minutes` remain unchanged, and no adjustments to the `heart_rate` due to exercise occur.\n\n4. **Rest Method**: No calls to the `rest` method are made, so there's no additional change to the `heart_rate`.\n\nGiven these steps, the only change to the `heart_rate` is a decrease of 5 points due to consuming 3 liters of water daily.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"} because the heart rate will indeed decrease under the given conditions.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - The initial heart rate is set to 70.\n   - No exercise has been performed yet, so `exercise_minutes` is 0.\n\n2. **External Factor**:\n   - An external factor ensures that exactly 3 liters of water are consumed daily.\n   - This action triggers the `drink_water` method with `liters = 3`.\n\n3. **Effect of `drink_water` Method**:\n   - The `daily_water_intake` is incremented by 3 liters.\n   - Since `daily_water_intake` exceeds 2 liters (it goes from 0 to 3), the condition `if self.daily_water_intake > 2:` is met.\n   - As a result, the heart rate decreases by 5 units: `self.heart_rate -= 5`.\n   - Therefore, the new heart rate after drinking 3 liters of water would be `70 - 5 = 65`.\n\n4. **Exercise Routine**:\n   - The problem states that the exercise routine is not adjusted, meaning `exercise_minutes` remains at 0.\n\n5. **Effect of `rest` Method**:\n   - The `rest` method is not called in this scenario, so it doesn't affect the heart rate.\n\nSince the only change in the heart rate is due to consuming 3 liters of water, and the heart rate decreases by 5 units, the heart rate will indeed decrease.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
