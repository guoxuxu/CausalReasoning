    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `weather_condition()` function randomly selects one of three weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. If we could control the weather to be sunny, we would directly set `weather` to 'sunny'.\n\n3. The `traffic_update(weather)` function then determines the traffic based on the weather condition:\n   - If the weather is 'rainy', traffic will be 'heavy'.\n   - If the weather is 'sunny', traffic will be 'light'.\n   - For any other condition (which would be 'cloudy' in this case), traffic will be 'moderate'.\n\n4. Given that we control the weather to be 'sunny', the `traffic_update(weather)` function will return 'light' traffic.\n\n5. The `decision_to_travel(traffic)` function then makes a decision to travel based on the traffic:\n   - If traffic is 'heavy', it returns `False`.\n   - For any other condition (including 'light'), it returns `True`.\n\n6.
