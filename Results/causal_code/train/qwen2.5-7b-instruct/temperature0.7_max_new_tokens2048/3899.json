    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `ProductInventory` class has an `inventory_check` method that returns the quantity of a product.\n2. If `inventory_check` returns 0 for a product, it means there are no units of that product in the inventory.\n3. However, returning 0 does not necessarily mean the product was never added. It could also mean that all units of the product have been sold out.\n4. The `add_product` method allows adding products to the inventory with a specified quantity.\n5. The `sell_product` method decreases the quantity of a product when it is sold, but it does not remove the product from the inventory entirely unless the quantity becomes zero.\n6. Therefore, a product could still exist in the inventory (even if its quantity is 0) after being fully sold out.\n\nGiven these points, we cannot conclusively say that a product was never added to the inventory just because `inventory_check` returns 0 for it.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ProductInventory` class has methods to add products, sell products, and check inventory levels.\n2. When checking the inventory level for a product using `inventory_check`, it returns the quantity of that product (or 0 if the product is not found).\n3. If the system shows 0 units of 'Markers', it means that either:\n   - The product 'Markers' was never added to the inventory at all.\n   - The product 'Markers' was added but then sold out completely.\n4. There's no method provided that explicitly removes a product from the inventory; it only decreases the quantity when selling.\n5. Therefore, showing 0 units does not necessarily mean the product was never added; it could have been added and then sold out.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot conclusively say that the product was never added to the inventory just because its current quantity is 0.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `ProductInventory` class starts with an empty dictionary `items`.\n\n2. **Adding Products**: When we call `add_product`, it adds the specified quantity of the product to the `items` dictionary.
