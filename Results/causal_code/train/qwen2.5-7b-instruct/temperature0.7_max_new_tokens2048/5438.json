    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `process_data` function takes an array of data, calculates its mean, and then normalizes each element by dividing it by this mean.\n\n2. The `add_noise` function adds normally distributed noise to the input data with a specified mean (`mu`) and standard deviation (`sigma`).\n\n3. In the provided code:\n   - Data is first generated as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n   - Noise is added to this data, resulting in `noisy_data`.\n   - Then, `noisy_data` is passed to `process_data`, which normalizes it.\n\n4. The key point here is that normalization (dividing by the mean) does not affect the noise values themselves. The noise is still added to the normalized data, but the noise values remain unchanged.\n\n5. Since the noise is added independently of the normalization process, the variability of the noise remains the same after normalization. Normalization affects the scale of the original data but does not alter the distribution or variance of the noise added to it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
