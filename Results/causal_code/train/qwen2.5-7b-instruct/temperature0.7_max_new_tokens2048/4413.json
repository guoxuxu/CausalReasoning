    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Health Score Calculation**:\n   - For individuals under 30 years old, the initial health score is 70.\n   - For individuals 30 years old and above, the initial health score is 50.\n\n2. **Effect of High Activity Level**:\n   - The code checks if `activity_level > 5` and adds 30 to the health score if true.\n\n3. **Current Policy Analysis**:\n   - Individuals under 30 start with a base score of 70.\n   - Adding 30 due to high activity level results in a final score of 100.\n   - Individuals 30 and older start with a base score of 50.\n   - Adding 30 due to high activity level results in a final score of 80.\n\n4. **Impact on Average Health Score**:\n   - Without considering age distribution, adding a high activity level will always result in an increase from the initial score (either from 70 to 100 or from 50 to 80).\n   - Since both new scores (100 and 80) are higher than their respective initial scores (70 and 50), the average health score will indeed increase if a high activity level is enforced for all age groups.\n\nTherefore, enforcing a high activity level for all age groups will increase the average health_score.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Current Health Score Calculation**:\n   - For ages under 30, the base health score is 70.\n   - For ages 30 and above, the base health score is 50.\n\n2. **Effect of Activity Level**:\n   - If the activity level is greater than 5, an additional 30 points are added to the health score.\n\n3. **Impact of Enforcing High Activity Levels**:\n   - Currently, only if the activity level is greater than 5 does it add 30 points.\n   - If we enforce a high activity level for all age groups, regardless of whether the activity level is actually greater than 5, we would be adding 30 points to everyone's health score.\n\n4. **Average Health Score Consideration**:\n   - The base scores (70 for <30 and 50 for ≥30) would remain the same.\n   - Adding 30 points to everyone’s health score would uniformly increase the average health score by 30 points.\n\nGiven that enforcing a high activity level for all age groups would uniformly increase the health score by 30 points, this would indeed increase the average health score.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

With a high activity level, they would receive an additional 30 points, making the total health score 100.\n- For individuals 30 years old or older, their base health score would be 50.
