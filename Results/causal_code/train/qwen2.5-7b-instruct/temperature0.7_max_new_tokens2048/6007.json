The function `process_data` takes two parameters:\n   - `data`: A list of numerical values.\n   - `filter_threshold`: A numerical value used as a threshold.\n\n2. Inside the function, it creates a new list `filtered_data` that contains only the elements from `data` that are greater than `filter_threshold`.\n\n3.

This line creates a new list containing only the elements from `data` that are greater than `filter_threshold`.\n4. If we increase the `filter_threshold`, we are setting a higher minimum value for what gets included in `filtered_data`.\n5.
