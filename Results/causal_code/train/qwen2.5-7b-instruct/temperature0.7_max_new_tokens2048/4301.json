    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficLightController` class has two attributes: `is_green` and `is_red`.\n2.

The `switch_to_green` method changes these values:\n   - It sets `self.is_green = True`\n   - It sets `self.is_red = False`\n\n4. The `switch_to_red` method does the opposite:\n   - It sets `self.is_green = False`\n   - It sets `self.is_red = True`\n\n5. The `add_traffic` method only checks if there is increased traffic and if the light is green, then it calls `switch_to_red`.\n\n6. There is no direct relationship or automatic change between `is_green` and `is_red` in the code provided. The `is_red` attribute is only set to `False` when `is_green` is explicitly set to `True` in the `switch_to_green` method.\n\nTherefore, setting `is_green` to `True` directly does not affect `is_red` unless `switch_to_green` is called, which explicitly sets `is_red` to `False`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1.

Now, let's look at the `switch_to_green` method:\n   - It sets `self.is_green = True`\n   - It explicitly sets `self.is_red = False`\n\n3. Next, we examine the `switch_to_red` method:\n   - It sets `self.is_green = False`\n   - It explicitly sets `self.is_red = True`\n\n4. Finally, we consider the `add_traffic` method:\n   - It only changes `is_green` to `True` if `increased_traffic` is True and `is_green` is already True.\n   - There is no automatic change to `is_red` in this method; it only affects `is_green`.\n\n5.
