    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_health_risk` calculates a risk score based on three factors:\n   - Age (if over 50)\n   - Smoking status (if true)\n   - BMI (if greater than 25)\n\n2. The scoring system is as follows:\n   - +20 points for being over 50 years old\n   - +30 points for being a smoker\n   - +10 points for having a BMI over 25\n\n3. A public policy that restricts smoking would likely result in fewer people being classified as smokers.\n\n4. If fewer people are smokers, the number of times the second condition (`if smoker:`) is met will decrease.\n\n5. As a result, the total risk score calculated by the function would be lower for many individuals because the +30 points for smoking would be less frequently added to the risk score.\n\n6. Therefore, implementing such a policy would indeed affect the health risk scores calculated by the function, leading to generally lower scores across the population.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_health_risk` calculates a health risk score based on three factors: age, whether the person is a smoker, and their BMI.\n\n2.

The restriction of smoking would directly impact one of the factors considered in the function: whether the person is a smoker.\n\n4. If a public policy successfully restricts smoking, it would reduce the number of people who are smokers.\n\n5. As a result, for those individuals who were previously smokers but are now no longer able to smoke due to the policy, their risk score would decrease by 30 points (the amount added for being a smoker).\n\n6.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_health_risk` calculates a health risk score based on three factors: age, smoking status (smoker), and BMI.\n\n2.
