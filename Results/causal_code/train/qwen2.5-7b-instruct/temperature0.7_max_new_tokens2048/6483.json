    "Let's break down the logic of the `compute_scores` function step by step:\n\n1. The function initializes `base_score` to 50.\n2. If 'age' is present in the `data`, it checks whether the age is greater than 30.\n   - If `age > 30`, `base_score` becomes 50 + 20 = 70.\n   - If `age <= 30`, `base_score` becomes 50 + 10 = 60.\n\n3. Regardless of the age value, if 'experience' is present in the `data`, the function adds either 15 or 30 to the `base_score` based on whether the experience is more than 5 or not.\n\nGiven this breakdown, we can reason about the effect of increasing the age from 30 or less to more than 30:\n\n- If the age is 30 or less, `base_score` will be 60 (50 + 10).\n- If the age is more than 30, `base_score` will be 70 (50 + 20).\n\nSince 70 is greater than 60, the function will indeed return a higher score when the age is increased beyond 30.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The question specifically asks about the impact of age on the score:\n   - If the age is greater than 30, the base score is 50 + 20 = 70.\n   - If the age is 30 or less, the base score is 50 + 10 = 60.\n\n5.
