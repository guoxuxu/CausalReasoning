    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have a WeatherSimulation class with two methods: `change_temperature` and `artificial_sun`.\n\n2.

Without additional context or information on how temperature changes impact happiness within the WeatherSimulation class, we cannot assume that setting the temperature to 23 degrees Celsius will result in a specific level of happiness.\n\n6.
