  "Explanation": "Since y is directly proportional to x, an increase in x causes y to increase. As both y and w are influenced by z, which is directly derived from y, any increase in y increases z. An increase in both y and z results in an increase in w. Thus, w increases as x increases.",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The initial value of `x` is 10.\n2. The value of `y` is calculated as `2 * x + 5`. \n   - When `x = 10`, `y = 2 * 10 + 5 = 25`.\n3. The value of `z` is calculated as `y - 4`.\n   - When `y = 25`, `z = 25 - 4 = 21`.\n4. The value of `w` is calculated as `z + y`.\n   - When `z = 21` and `y = 25`, `w = 21 + 25 = 46`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if `x` increases:\n\n1. If `x` increases, it will directly affect the calculation of `y` because `y = 2 * x + 5`.\n2. Since `y` depends on `x`, an increase in `x` will result in an increase in `y`.\n3. An increase in `y` will then affect the calculation of `z` (since `z = y - 4`), leading to an increase in `z`.\n4. Finally, since `w = z + y`, an increase in both `z` and `y` will result in an increase in `w`.\n\nTherefore, if `x` increases, `w` will also increase without any intervention.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
