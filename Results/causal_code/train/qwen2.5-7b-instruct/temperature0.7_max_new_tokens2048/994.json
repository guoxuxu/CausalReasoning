    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `update_score` takes three parameters: `score`, `bonus`, and `penalty`.\n2. It calculates the new score as `new_score = score + bonus - penalty`.\n3. We have initial values:\n   - `initial_score = 100`\n   - `additional_bonus = 20`\n   - `extra_penalty = 5`\n4. If we set the penalty to zero, the formula becomes:\n   - `new_score = initial_score + additional_bonus - 0`\n5. Substituting the values:\n   - `new_score = 100 + 20 - 0`\n   - `new_score = 120`\n\nNow, if we want to check if the new score equals the sum of the initial score and the bonus:\n- Sum of initial score and bonus: `100 + 20 = 120`\n\nSince setting the penalty to zero results in a new score of 120, which is indeed the sum of the initial score (100) and the bonus (20), the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Substituting the given values:\n   - `new_score = 100 + 20`\n   - So, `new_score = 120`\n\nNow, let's check if this matches the scenario where the penalty is set to zero:\n- With penalty = 0, the calculation is indeed `100 + 20 - 0`, which equals 120.\n\nTherefore, if the penalty is set to zero, the new score will equal the sum of the initial score and the bonus.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
