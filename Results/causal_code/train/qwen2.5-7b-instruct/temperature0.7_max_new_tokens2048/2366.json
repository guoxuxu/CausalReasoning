    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The `Server` class has an initial `requestsHandled` count of 0.\n   - The `handleRequest` method increments this count by 1 each time it is called.\n\n2. **Simulate Activity Function**:\n   - This function runs for 60 iterations.\n   - On each iteration, it calls `handleRequest` once.\n   - Every 5th iteration (i.e., at i=0, 5, 10, ..., 55), it also calls `openConnection` on the `Database` object.\n\n3. **Resetting RequestsHandled**:\n   - We are asked to reset the `requestsHandled` count to 0 after every 30 requests.\n   - Since there are 60 iterations, we would reset `requestsHandled` twice (after 30 and 60 requests).\n\n4. **Effect on ServerLoad**:\n   - Initially, `requestsHandled` goes from 0 to 30.\n   - After resetting, it starts again from 0.\n   - It reaches 30 again and then resets.\n   - By the end of the loop, `requestsHandled` will be reset to 0 before reaching 50.\n\n5. **Condition for High Load**:\n   - The condition for setting `serverLoad` to 'High' is `if (this.requestsHandled > 50)`.\n   - Since we reset the count to 0 after every 30 requests, it never exceeds 50.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the serverLoad will not become 'High' because the `requestsHandled` count is reset before it can reach 50.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - `server` starts with `requestsHandled = 0` and `serverLoad = 'Low'`.\n   - `database` starts with `connections = 0` and `dataLoad = 'Low'`.\n\n2. **Simulate Activity Function**:\n   - The function runs a loop 60 times.\n   - In each iteration, it calls `handleRequest` on the server.\n   - Every 5th request (i.e., at iterations 5, 10, 15, etc.), it calls `openConnection` on the database.\n\n3. **handleRequest Method**:\n   - Increments `requestsHandled` by 1.\n   - If `requestsHandled` exceeds 50, sets `serverLoad` to 'High'.\n\n4. **Resetting `requestsHandled`**:\n   - We manually reset `requestsHandled` to 0 after every 30 requests.\n\nNow, let's analyze what happens when we reset `requestsHandled`:\n\n- After 30 requests, `requestsHandled` is reset to 0.\n- The next 30 requests will increment `requestsHandled` from 0 to 30, which is less than 50.\n- Therefore, `serverLoad` will remain 'Low' during these 30 requests.\n\nSince we reset `requestsHandled` after every 30 requests, it will never exceed 50 within any 30-request interval.

If `requestsHandled` exceeds 50, `serverLoad` is set to 'High'.\n3. In `simulateActivity`, the loop runs 60 times.\n4. Every iteration, `handleRequest` is called with 'NewRequest'.\n5. Additionally, every 5th iteration, `database.openConnection` is called.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of resetting `requestsHandled` to 0 after every 30 requests:\n\n1. After 30 requests, `requestsHandled` is reset to 0.\n2. This means that even though the loop runs 60 times, the actual number of requests handled at any point is limited to 30.\n3. Since `requestsHandled` is reset to 0 after every 30 requests, it can never exceed 50 during the execution of the function.\n\nTherefore, `serverLoad` will not become 'High' because `requestsHandled` will never exceed 50 due to the manual reset.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

Every iteration, `handleRequest` is called, incrementing `requestsHandled`.\n5. Every 5th iteration, `openConnection` is called on the `database`, but this does not affect `serverLoad`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if we reset `requestsHandled` to zero after every 30 requests:\n\n1. After 30 requests, `requestsHandled` is reset to 0.\n2. This process repeats, so after another 30 requests (total of 60), `requestsHandled` is again reset to 0.\n\nSince `requestsHandled` is reset to 0 after every 30 requests, it will never exceed 50 during the course of the simulation.\n\nTherefore, the serverLoad will **not** become 'High' under these conditions.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
