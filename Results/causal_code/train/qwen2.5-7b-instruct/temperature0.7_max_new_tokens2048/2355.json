    "Let's reason through the code step by step:\n\n1. A `Market` object is instantiated with initial values:\n   - `demand = 100`\n   - `supply = 100`\n\n2. The `increasePrice()` method is called:\n   - This method increases `supply` by 10 and decreases `demand` by 30.\n   - New values after `increasePrice()`:\n     - `demand = 100 - 30 = 70`\n     - `supply = 100 + 10 = 110`\n\n3. The `addPromotion()` method is called:\n   - This method increases `demand` by 20 and decreases it by `supply * 0.1`.\n   - Calculations for `addPromotion()`:\n     - Increase demand by 20: `70 + 20 = 90`\n     - Decrease demand by `supply * 0.1`: `110 * 0.1 = 11`\n     - Final demand value: `90 - 11 = 79`\n\n4. The `console.log(market.demand);` statement outputs the current `demand`, which is 79.\n\nGiven that methods have been called, the demand is not 100; it has changed to 79 due to the operations performed by these methods.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Market` class is defined with initial values for `demand` and `supply`.\n2. The `increasePrice` method increases supply by 10 and decreases demand by 30.\n3. The `addPromotion` method increases demand by 20 and then decreases it by 10% of the current supply.\n4. The `decreasePrice` method decreases supply by 10 and increases demand by 30.\n5. The `removePromotion` method decreases demand by 20 and then increases it by 5% of the current supply.\n\nNow, let's see what happens when we create an instance of `Market` and call `increasePrice()` and `addPromotion()`:\n\n1. When `market.increasePrice()` is called:\n   - `demand` decreases from 100 to 70 (100 - 30).\n   - `supply` increases from 100 to 110 (100 + 10).\n\n2. When `market.addPromotion()` is called:\n   - `demand` increases from 70 to 90 (70 + 20).\n   - `demand` then decreases by 10% of the current supply (10% of 110 is 11), so `demand` becomes 79 (90 - 11).\n\nSince the methods are called, the demand is not 100 anymore. It has been modified to 79 after the two method calls.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Market` class is defined with initial values for `demand` and `supply`.\n2. The `increasePrice` method increases the supply by 10 and decreases the demand by 30.\n3. The `addPromotion` method increases the demand by 20 and then subtracts 10% of the current supply from it.\n4. The `removePromotion` method decreases the demand by 20 and then adds 5% of the current supply to it.\n\nNow, let's see what happens when we create an instance of `Market` and call the methods `increasePrice` and `addPromotion`:\n\n- Initially, `market.demand` is 100.\n- Calling `increasePrice()`:\n  - `this.supply` becomes 110 (100 + 10)\n  - `this.demand` becomes 70 (100 - 30)\n- Calling `addPromotion()`:\n  - First, `this.demand` becomes 90 (70 + 20)\n  - Then, it decreases by 10% of the current supply (110 * 0.1 = 11), so `this.demand` becomes 79 (90 - 11)\n\nAfter these operations, `market.demand` is 79, not 100.\n\nTherefore, if no methods are called, the demand remains 100.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The `addPromotion` method increases the demand by 20 and then subtracts 10% of the current supply from it.\n4. The `removePromotion` method decreases the demand by 20 and then adds 5% of the current supply to it.\n\nNow, let's see what happens when we create an instance of `Market` and call the methods as specified in the code:\n\n1. `market = new Market();` initializes the `Market` object with `demand` and `supply` at 100.\n2. `market.increasePrice();`:\n   - Supply becomes 110 (100 + 10)\n   - Demand becomes 70 (100 - 30)\n3. `market.addPromotion();`:\n   - Demand becomes 90 (70 + 20)\n   - Demand then becomes approximately 81 (90 - 11) because 10% of 110 is 11.\n\nSo, after calling these methods, the demand is 81, not 100.\n\nTherefore, if no method in the code is called, the demand remains 100.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
