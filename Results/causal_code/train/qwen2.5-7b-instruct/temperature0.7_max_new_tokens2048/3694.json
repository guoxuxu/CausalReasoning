    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes three parameters: `data`, `filter_value`, and `modify_value`.\n\n2. Inside the function, it checks if `filter_value` is present in `data` using the condition `if filter_value in data:`.\n\n3. If `filter_value` is found in `data`, the following steps occur:\n   - The index of `filter_value` in `data` is found using `index = data.index(filter_value)`.\n   - The element at that index in `data` is replaced with `modify_value` using `data[index] = modify_value`.\n   - A variable `modified` is set to `True` with `modified = True`.\n\n4. If `filter_value` is not found in `data`, the function sets `modified` to `False` without making any changes to `data`.\n\n5. The function returns both `data` and `modified` as a tuple.\n\nGiven the logic of the function, we can reason as follows:\n\n- If `filter_value` is present in `data`, the function will find its index and replace it with `modify_value`.\n- As a direct result of finding and replacing `filter_value`, the `modified` variable is explicitly set to `True`.\n\nTherefore, if `filter_value` is present in `data`, `modified` will indeed always be set to `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Then, it replaces the value at that index with `modify_value` using `data[index] = modify_value`.\n5. It sets `modified` to `True` in this case.\n6. If `filter_value` is not found in `data`, it sets `modified` to `False`.\n7. Finally, it returns both `data` and `modified`.\n\nNow, considering the specific call:\n\n```python\nresult, modified_status = process_data([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, 10)\n```\n\n- `data` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n- `filter_value` is `3`\n- `modify_value` is `10`\n\nSince `3` is present in `data`, the function will execute the block of code inside the `if` statement, setting `modified` to `True`.\n\nTherefore, if `filter_value` is present in `data`, `modified` will indeed always be set to `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

If `filter_value` is not found in `data`, it sets `modified` to `False`.\n\n7. The function returns both the modified `data` list and the status of whether any modification was made (`modified`).\n\nGiven this logic, if `filter_value` is indeed present in `data`, the function will always perform the modifications (replacing the value and setting `modified` to `True`).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
