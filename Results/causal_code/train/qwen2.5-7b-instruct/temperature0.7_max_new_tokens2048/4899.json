    "Let's break down the logic of the function `adjust_temperature` to determine if `room_temp` will increase when `heater_on` is True.\n\n1. **Condition Check**: The function first checks if `heater_on` is True.\n2. **True Case**: If `heater_on` is True, the function executes `room_temp += 2`. This means that `room_temp` will be increased by 2.\n3. **False Case**: If `heater_on` is False, the function does not modify `room_temp` directly. Instead, it checks if `room_temp` is greater than `target_temp`. If it is, then `room_temp` will be decreased by 1. However, this case is irrelevant for our specific question where `heater_on` is True.\n\nGiven the above steps, we can conclude that when `heater_on` is True, `room_temp` will indeed increase by 2.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `adjust_temperature` takes three parameters: `room_temp`, `target_temp`, and `heater_on`.\n\n2. We are specifically asked about the case where `heater_on` is True.\n\n3. When `heater_on` is True, we enter the first part of the conditional statement:\n   ```python\n   if heater_on:\n       room_temp += 2\n   ```\n\n4. This line directly increments `room_temp` by 2 when the heater is on.\n\n5. There is no condition here that would prevent the increment from happening if `heater_on` is True.\n\n6. Therefore, if `heater_on` is True, `room_temp` will definitely increase by 2.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to the question \"If `heater_on` is True, will `room_temp` increase?\" is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The operation `room_temp += 2` directly increases the value of `room_temp` by 2.\n\n5. There is no other part of the code that would decrease `room_temp` when `heater_on` is True.\n\n6.
