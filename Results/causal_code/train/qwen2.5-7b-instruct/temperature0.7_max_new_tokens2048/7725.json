If `external_influence()` returns `True`, the person will travel even if the weather is sunny.\n- Therefore, under normal circumstances (no external influence), the person will indeed decide to travel when the weather is sunny.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Weather Condition**: The function `weather_condition` randomly selects one of three weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. **Decide to Travel**: The function `decide_to_travel` checks the weather condition returned by `weather_condition`. If the weather is sunny, it returns `True` for traveling; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n3. **External Influence**: The function `external_influence` randomly decides whether there is an external force that compels the person to travel.\n\n4. **Final Decision**: The function `final_decision` combines both the natural decision (based on weather) and any external influence.

Otherwise, the decision follows the natural decision based on the weather.\n\nGiven these steps, we can now answer the question: \"If the weather is sunny, will the person decide to travel?\"\n\n- When the weather is sunny, `decide_to_travel` returns `True`.\n- However, `final_decision` also considers an external influence. There is a 50% chance that `external_influence` returns `True`, which would override the natural decision.\n\nTherefore, while the natural decision (based solely on weather) would be to travel when it's sunny, there is still a 50% chance that an external influence might prevent the person from traveling.\n\nSince the question asks if the person will definitely decide to travel when the weather is sunny, the answer is no, because of the possibility of an external influence.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
