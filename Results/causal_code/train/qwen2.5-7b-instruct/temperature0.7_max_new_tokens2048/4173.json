    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Vehicle` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the vehicle with a certain number of wheels and color, and sets the initial speed to 0.\n\n2. The `accelerate` method increases the speed by a specified increment.\n\n3. The `apply_brakes` method decreases the speed by a specified decrement.\n\n4. In the provided code, we create an instance of `Vehicle` named `car` with 4 wheels and red color.\n\n5. We then call `car.accelerate(10)`, which increases the speed by 10 units, setting the speed to 10.\n\n6. Next, we call `car.apply_brakes(3)`, which decreases the speed by 3 units, setting the speed to 7.\n\n7. The final speed is printed as 7.\n\nGiven this sequence of events, we can see that the speed did change (from 0 to 7), and both `accelerate` and `apply_brakes` methods were indeed called.\n\nTherefore, if a vehicle's speed remains constant, it cannot be inferred that neither `accelerate` nor `apply_brakes` methods were called, because even if they were called, the increments and decrements could balance out to keep the speed constant.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

Next, we call `car.apply_brakes(3)`, which reduces the speed by 3, resulting in a final speed of 7.\n\nGiven these steps, we can see that the speed is not constant after the operations. \n\nHowever, the question asks if the vehicle's speed remaining constant can be inferred from the methods not being called.
