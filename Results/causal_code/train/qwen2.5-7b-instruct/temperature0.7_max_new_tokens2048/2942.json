    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with an instance of `ProductManager` initialized with two products: 'Widget' and 'Gadget'.\n\n2. The `add_product` method is called with 'Thingamajig'. This method does two things:\n   - It appends 'Thingamajig' to the `products` list.\n   - It calls the `notify_customers` method, passing 'Thingamajig' as an argument.\n\n3. The `notify_customers` method takes a product as an argument and prints a message indicating that a new product has been added.\n\n4. Since 'Thingamajig' is passed to `notify_customers`, the message \"New product added: Thingamajig\" will be printed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a `ProductManager` class with methods to add and remove products.\n2. The `add_product` method adds a new product to the list and then calls `notify_customers` with the new product.\n3. The `notify_customers` method prints a message indicating that a new product has been added.\n4. In the sample usage, we create an instance of `ProductManager` with two initial products: 'Widget' and 'Gadget'.\n5. We then call `add_product` with 'Thingamajig'. This adds it to the list and triggers the `notify_customers` method.\n6. The `notify_customers` method prints \"New product added: Thingamajig\".\n\nTherefore, when 'Thingamajig' is added to the products, there will indeed be a notification for \"New product added: Thingamajig\".\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. The `ProductManager` class is initialized with an empty list of products.\n2. The `add_product` method is called with 'Thingamajig'. This appends 'Thingamajig' to the `products` list and then calls the `notify_customers` method with 'Thingamajig'.\n3. The `notify_customers` method prints \"New product added: {product}\", where `{product}` is replaced with the name of the product passed to it.\n4. When 'Widget' is removed using the `remove_product` method, the `notify_customers` method is called again, but this time with 'Widget'.\n\nGiven this sequence of events, the only call to `notify_customers` that involves 'Thingamajig' is when it is added. Therefore, there will indeed be a notification for 'New product added: Thingamajig'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
