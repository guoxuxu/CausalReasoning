  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The method adjust_humidity() sets new humidity and generates an alert 'Low humidity' only if the new humidity value is below 30. Hence, finding this alert in the list implies that at one point, the humidity was set below this threshold.",
  "causal_map": "adjust_humidity → generate_alert; humidity < 30 → 'Low humidity' alert in alerts",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `adjust_humidity` method sets a new humidity value and checks if it's below 30.\n2.
