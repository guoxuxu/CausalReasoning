  "Explanation": "While the active status being true generally implies that the steps are over 10,000, it's not guaranteed as the active status could potentially be modified by other parts of the system not shown here, or steps could be reset to 0 afterward yet the active status could erroneously remain true due to a bug or a missed reset.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `recordSteps` method increases the `steps` counter by the given count.\n2. If the `steps` counter exceeds 10,000, the `active` flag is set to true.\n3. However, setting `active` to true only occurs when the `steps` exceed 10,000, not necessarily when they reach exactly 10,000.\n4. There could be scenarios where `steps` are less than 10,000 but still greater than 9,999 and the `active` flag is already set.\n5. Conversely, if `steps` are exactly 10,000, the `active` flag will be true, but steps would not be strictly over 10,000.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that having `active` as true does not strictly guarantee that `steps` are over 10,000. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `recordSteps` method increments the `steps` variable by the provided count.\n2. If the updated `steps` value exceeds 10,000, the `active` flag is set to true.\n3. The `isActive` method simply returns the current state of the `active` flag.\n\nNow, for the active status to be true:\n- It must have been incremented to a value greater than 10,000 at some point.\n\nHowever, being active does not guarantee that the exact number of steps is over 10,000 because:\n- The app can be active with a number of steps just above 10,000 (e.g., 10,001).\n- If the steps were exactly 10,000 and then an additional step was recorded, the active status would still be true, but the number of steps would be 10,001.\n\nTherefore, while an active status indicates that the steps have exceeded 10,000 at some point, it does not guarantee that the current number of steps is exactly over 10,000.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

However, setting `active` to true only guarantees that `steps` is greater than 10,000 at the moment `recordSteps` is called.\n3. Between calls to `recordSteps`, the number of steps can change.\n4.

Additionally, `active` could have been set to true in a previous call to `recordSteps`, and subsequent calls might have reduced the step count below 10,000 without changing `active`.\n\n5.

The condition for setting `active` to true is `if (steps > 10000)`, which means `active` will be true as soon as `steps` exceeds 10,000.\n4. This implies that once `active` becomes true, `steps` could be slightly more than 10,000, but not necessarily exactly 10,001 or any specific number above 10,000.\n5.
