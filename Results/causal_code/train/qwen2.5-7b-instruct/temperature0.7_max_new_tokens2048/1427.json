    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1.

The constructor of `WeatherSimulator` takes one parameter: `isWeekend`.\n\n3. If `isWeekend` is true:\n   - `isSunny` is set to `Math.random() > 0.3`.\n     - This means there's a 70% chance it will be sunny on weekends.\n   - The temperature is set based on whether it's sunny:\n     - If sunny, the temperature is between 22 and 31 degrees.\n     - If not sunny, the temperature is between 18 and 23 degrees.\n\n4. If `isWeekend` is false (i.e., it's a weekday):\n   - `isSunny` is set to `Math.random() > 0.5`.\n     - This means there's a 50% chance it will be sunny on weekdays.\n   - The temperature is set similarly based on whether it's sunny:\n     - If sunny, the temperature is between 20 and 25 degrees.\n     - If not sunny, the temperature is between 16 and 19 degrees.\n\n5.
