    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes three parameters: `data`, `factor`, and `method`.\n\n2. If `method` is set to 'normalize', the function proceeds as follows:\n   - It calculates the `max_value` of the `data`.\n   - It then normalizes each element `x` in `data` using the formula `x / max_value * factor`.\n\n3. The key point here is that the normalization only depends on the `data` and the `factor`. The `max_value` is derived from `data`, and the normalization is directly based on this maximum value.\n\n4. There are no other inputs or factors that influence the normalization process once `method` is set to 'normalize'.\n\n5.
