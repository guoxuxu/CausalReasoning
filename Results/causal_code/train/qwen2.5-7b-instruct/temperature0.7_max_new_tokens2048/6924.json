  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Pre-processing to remove negatives will not affect the 'mean_value', because the 'clean_data' method within the DataProcessor class inherently performs this action. Hence, the preprocessing step outside the class doesn't change resulting 'mean_value' since it duplicates the internal cleaning logic.",
  "causal_map": "cleaned_data → mean_value; data → cleaned_data",
  "causal_map_integration": "By removing all negative values from 'data' before initializing the DataProcessor instance, the 'cleaned_data' will contain only non-negative values, which will result in a potentially higher 'mean_value' because the mean is calculated based on a smaller set of values that are generally larger than the original set including negatives.",
