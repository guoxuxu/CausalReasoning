  "Explanation": "The code specifies that when the lights are set to green (1), the traffic is set to smooth (0). Therefore, seeing a green traffic light directly causes less traffic.",
  "causal_map": "lights → traffic; traffic → accident",
  "causal_map_integration": "The traffic light color directly influences traffic density, which in turn determines whether an accident occurs.",

    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The variable `lights` is initialized to 1, which represents a green light.\n2. We have an `if-else` statement checking the value of `lights`:\n   - If `lights == 0`, then `traffic` is set to 1 (indicating heavy traffic).\n   - If `lights == 1`, then `traffic` is set to 0 (indicating smooth traffic).\n   - If `lights == 2`, then `traffic` is set to 1 (indicating heavy traffic).\n\n3. Since `lights` is 1 (green), the condition `if (lights == 1)` is true, and thus `traffic` is set to 0.\n\n4. A value of 0 for `traffic` indicates that the traffic is smooth.\n\nTherefore, if the traffic light is green (lights == 1), the traffic will indeed be smooth.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Since `lights` is 1, this condition is false.\n\n5. **Final decision:**\n   - After setting `traffic` to 0 when `lights` is 1, the value of `traffic` remains 0.\n   - Then, the code checks if `traffic == 1` and sets `accident` accordingly.
