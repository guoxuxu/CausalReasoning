    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_interest` calculates the final balance after a certain number of years with compound interest.\n\n2.

In the code provided, `account_balance` starts at 1000 and `annual_rate` is set to 5%.\n\n4. The for loop runs 10 times, each time updating `account_balance` with the new balance calculated using the current `annual_rate`.\n\n5. If we increase the `annual_rate`, the term \\((1 + \\frac{\\text{annual\\_rate}}{100})\\) will become larger because we're adding a higher percentage to 1.\n\n6. This means that each time the loop runs, the new `account_balance` will be larger than it would have been if the `annual_rate` was lower.\n\n7. Since the loop runs 10 times, the effect of a higher `annual_rate` compounds over these iterations, leading to a significantly higher final `account_balance`.\n\nTherefore, if the value of `annual_rate` increases, the value of `account_balance` after the loop will logically be higher.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_interest` calculates the final balance based on the initial account balance, annual rate, and number of years.\n\n2. In the provided code, the `account_balance` is initially set to 1000, and the `annual_rate` is set to 5%.\n\n3. A loop runs for 10 years, with the `compute_interest` function being called each year to update the `account_balance`.\n\n4.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_interest` calculates the final balance after a certain number of years using the formula for compound interest.\n\n2.

The code simulates 10 years of interest calculation, with each iteration of the loop calculating the new balance based on the previous year's balance.\n\n5. If the `annual_rate` increases, the amount added to the balance each year will be larger because the interest is calculated as a percentage of the current balance.\n\n6.
