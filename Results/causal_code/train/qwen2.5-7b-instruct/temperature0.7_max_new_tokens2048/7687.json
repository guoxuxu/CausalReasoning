    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. It checks if the key 'error' exists in `data`.\n3. If 'error' is found, it sets `data['status']` to 'failed'.\n4. If 'error' is not found, it sets `data['status']` to 'success' and `data['processed']` to `True`.\n5. Then it checks the value of the 'user' key.\n6. If 'user' is 'admin', it sets `data['priority']` to 'high'.\n7.
