    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `update_inventory` takes two parameters: `sales` and `production`.\n2. Inside the function:\n   - `current_inventory` is initialized to 1000.\n   - `purchases` is calculated as `production - sales`.\n   - `current_inventory` is updated by adding `purchases` to it.\n3. The function returns the updated `current_inventory`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when production equals sales:\n\n4. If `production` equals `sales`, then `purchases` would be:\n   - `purchases = production - sales`\n   - When `production = sales`, `purchases = 0`.\n\n5. Therefore, the `current_inventory` would not change because:\n   - `current_inventory += purchases`\n   - With `purchases = 0`, `current_inventory` remains at its initial value of 1000.\n\nGiven that the initial inventory is 1000 and `purchases` would be 0 if `production` equals `sales`, the updated inventory would indeed remain unchanged at 1000.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Inventory**: The initial inventory is set to 1000 units.\n\n2. **Purchases Calculation**: In the function `update_inventory`, the variable `purchases` is calculated as:\n   ```\n   purchases = production - sales\n   ```\n   If production equals sales, then:\n   ```\n   purchases = production - production = 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Inventory Update**: The inventory is updated based on the `purchases` value:\n   ```\n   current_inventory += purchases\n   ```\n   Since `purchases` is 0 when production equals sales, the inventory will not change.\n\n4. **Final Inventory Check**: Let's check the code snippet with the given values:\n   - `sales_today = 500`\n   - `production_today = 500` (assuming production equals sales)\n   - The function call:\n     ```\n     updated_inventory = update_inventory(500, 500)\n     ```\n   - Inside the function:\n     - `purchases = 500 - 500 = 0`\n     - `current_inventory = 1000 + 0 = 1000`\n   \n   Therefore, the updated inventory remains 1000 units.\n\nBased on this reasoning, if production is set to equal sales, the updated inventory will indeed remain unchanged.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
