    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The original code classifies users as 'High spender' if their 'money_spent' is greater than 1000.\n2. The modified code changes the threshold to 2000 for being classified as a 'High spender'.\n3. A user spends 1500.\n4. Since 1500 is less than the new threshold of 2000, the user will not meet the criteria to be classified as a 'High spender'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
