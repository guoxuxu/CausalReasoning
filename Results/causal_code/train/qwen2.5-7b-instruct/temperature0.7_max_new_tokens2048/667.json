    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The `log_request` function checks several conditions to decide whether to log a request based on `error_log_enabled`, `request['status_code']`, and `debug_mode`.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conditions**:\n   - If `error_log_enabled` is `True`:\n     - Logs errors (status codes >= 500).\n     - Logs debug information for status code 404 if `debug_mode` is `True`.\n   - If `error_log_enabled` is `False`:\n     - Logs debug information only for specific status codes (403, 405) if `debug_mode` is `True`.\n     - No logging occurs otherwise.\n\n3. **Specific Case Analysis**:\n   - For the request `{'status_code': 405}` with `error_log_enabled=False` and `debug_mode=True`:\n     - The function will execute the block where `error_log_enabled` is `False`.\n     - Since `debug_mode` is `True`, it will print \"Logging debug only mode: \", request.\n   \n4. **Effect of Turning Off `debug_mode`**:\n   - If we turn off `debug_mode` for the same request (`{'status_code': 405}`, `error_log_enabled=False`), the condition `if debug_mode and request['status_code'] in [403, 405]` will no longer be true.\n   - Therefore, the function will print \"Logging disabled\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Turning off `debug_mode` indeed turns off the logs for that specific request when `error_log_enabled` is `False`.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the function `log_request` step by step to determine if turning off `debug_mode` would turn off the logs that contain 'Logging debug only mode:'.\n\n1. **Function Structure**:\n   - The function takes three parameters: `request`, `error_log_enabled`, and `debug_mode`.\n   - It checks if `error_log_enabled` is `True`. If it is, it proceeds with the logging based on the `request['status_code']` and `debug_mode`.\n\n2. **Case Analysis When `error_log_enabled` is True**:\n   - If `request['status_code'] >= 500`, it prints \"Logging error: \", followed by the request.\n   - If `debug_mode` is `True` and `request['status_code'] == 404`, it prints \"Logging debug: \", followed by the request.\n   - Otherwise, it prints \"No logging needed\".\n\n3. **Case Analysis When `error_log_enabled` is False**:\n   - If `debug_mode` is `True` and `request['status_code']` is either `403` or `405`, it prints \"Logging debug only mode: \", followed by the request.\n   - Otherwise, it prints \"Logging disabled\".\n\n4. **Specific Case of Interest**:\n   - We are interested in the scenario where `error_log_enabled` is `False` and `debug_mode` is `True`.\n   - According to the function logic, when `error_log_enabled` is `False`, regardless of `debug_mode`, the function will print \"Logging disabled\".\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - When `error_log_enabled` is `False`, the function explicitly prints \"Logging disabled\" and does not proceed to check `debug_mode`.\n   - Therefore, turning off `debug_mode` will not change the outcome because the logs containing 'Logging debug only mode:' are only printed when `error_log_enabled` is `True` and `debug_mode` is `True`.\n\nBased on this analysis, turning off `debug_mode` will not turn off the logs that contain 'Logging debug only mode:' because those logs are only printed under specific conditions where `error_log_enabled` is also `True`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze the function `log_request` step by step to determine if turning off `debug_mode` would turn off the logs that contain 'Logging debug only mode:'.\n\n1. **Check `error_log_enabled`:**\n   - If `error_log_enabled` is `True`, proceed with checking the status code.\n   - If `error_log_enabled` is `False`, skip any logging based on `debug_mode`.\n\n2. **Check `debug_mode` when `error_log_enabled` is `True`:**\n   - If `request['status_code']` is 404 and `debug_mode` is `True`, log \"Logging debug: \", request.\n   - If `request['status_code']` is 403 or 405 and `debug_mode` is `True`, log \"Logging debug only mode: \", request.\n   - Otherwise, log \"No logging needed\".\n\n3. **Check `debug_mode` when `error_log_enabled` is `False`:**\n   - If `debug_mode` is `True`, log \"Logging debug only mode: \", request.\n   - Otherwise, log \"Logging disabled\".\n\nNow, let's consider the specific case where we turn off `debug_mode`:\n\n- With `debug_mode` set to `False`, the function will follow the logic for when `debug_mode` is `False`.\n- The function checks if `error_log_enabled` is `False`. Since it is not, it directly logs \"Logging disabled\".\n\nTherefore, turning off `debug_mode` does not affect the logging behavior when `error_log_enabled` is `False`. The logs containing 'Logging debug only mode:' can only occur when `debug_mode` is `True` and `error_log_enabled` is `True`.\n\nBased on this analysis, turning off `debug_mode` would not turn off the logs that contain 'Logging debug only mode:' because those logs require `debug_mode` to be `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `log_request` has three main conditions to determine whether logging should occur:\n   - If `error_log_enabled` is True and the request status code is 500 or higher, it logs an error.\n   - If `error_log_enabled` is True, `debug_mode` is True, and the request status code is 404, it logs debug information.\n   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints \"No logging needed\".\n\n2. There is an additional condition when `error_log_enabled` is False:\n   - If `debug_mode` is True and the request status code is 403 or 405, it logs debug information.\n   - Otherwise, it prints \"Logging disabled\".\n\n3. The specific case we're interested in is when the function outputs \"Logging debug only mode:\".\n\n4. This output occurs when:\n   - `error_log_enabled` is False.\n   - `debug_mode` is True.\n   - The request status code is one of [403, 405].\n\n5. To determine if turning off `debug_mode` would turn off these logs, we need to check what happens when `debug_mode` is False:\n   - When `error_log_enabled` is False and `debug_mode` is False, regardless of the request status code, the function will print \"Logging disabled\".\n\n6. Therefore, turning off `debug_mode` would indeed turn off the \"Logging debug only mode:\" output because the entire block that produces this output depends on both `error_log_enabled` being False and `debug_mode` being True.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

This condition checks if `debug_mode` is True and logs a message for status codes 403 or 405.\n\n4. Now, let's consider what happens when `debug_mode` is turned off:\n   - When `debug_mode` is False, the condition `if debug_mode and ...` will always be False.\n   - Therefore, no debug-only logs will be printed regardless of other settings.\n\n5.
