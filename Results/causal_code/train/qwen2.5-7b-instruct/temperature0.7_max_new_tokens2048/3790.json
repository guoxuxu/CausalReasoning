    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `changeWeather` method takes two parameters: `clouds` and `rain`.\n\n2. If `clouds` is true:\n   - `isCloudy` is set to true.\n   - If `rain` is also true, then `isRaining` is set to true and the temperature decreases by 5 degrees.\n\n3. If `clouds` is false:\n   - `isCloudy` is set to false.\n   - If `rain` is false, then `isRaining` is set to false and the temperature increases by 3 degrees.\n\n4. The question asks if clouds being present will necessarily mean it rains.\n\n5. Looking at the logic inside the `if (clouds)` block:\n   - For it to rain when clouds are present, the `rain` parameter must be true.\n   - However, even if clouds are present, it's possible for `rain` to be false, in which case it won't rain.\n\n6. Therefore, just because clouds are present does not guarantee that it will rain.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

If `clouds` is false:\n   - `isCloudy` is set to false.\n   - If `rain` is false, `isRaining` is explicitly set to false and the temperature increases by 3 degrees.\n   - If `rain` is true, `isRaining` is set to true, but this only happens if there are no clouds.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that having clouds does not necessarily mean it will rain.
