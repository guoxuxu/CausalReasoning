    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Current Implementation**:\n   - The `update_performance_rating` method sets the `performance_rating` attribute.\n   - If the `performance_rating` is greater than 8, the `promotion_eligibility` attribute is set to `True`.\n   - The `receive_bonus` method checks the `promotion_eligibility` attribute and returns a bonus of 1000 if eligible, otherwise 0.\n\n2. **Proposed Change**:\n   - The performance rating method is suggested to consider additional factors like teamwork.\n   \n3. **Impact on Bonus Calculation**:\n   - Currently, the bonus is only granted if the `promotion_eligibility` is `True`, which is determined solely by the `performance_rating`.\n   - If the new method includes additional factors like teamwork, these would be incorporated into the `performance_rating` calculation.\n   - Since the `receive_bonus` method still depends on `promotion_eligibility`, and `promotion_eligibility` is based on the updated `performance_rating`, any change that affects the `performance_rating` could indirectly affect the bonus.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Yes, if the performance rating method changes to include additional factors like teamwork, it will indeed affect the employee's bonus because these factors would influence the `performance_rating`, which in turn determines `promotion_eligibility`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
