    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthSystem` class has an `add_patient` method which adds a patient to the system with a given `health_status`.\n\n2. For a patient to be eligible for medication prescription, their initial health status must be 'Sick'.\n\n3. The `prescribe_medication` method checks if the patient's current health status is 'Sick' before prescribing medication.\n\n4. If the patient's health status is indeed 'Sick', the method changes it to 'Under Treatment' and returns 'Medication Prescribed'.\n\n5. If the patient's health status is not 'Sick', the method returns 'Medication Not Necessary'.\n\nGiven that the problem statement specifies adding a patient with a health status of 'Sick', we can conclude that the `prescribe_medication` method will indeed prescribe medication for this patient.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthSystem` class has a method called `prescribe_medication`.\n\n2. This method takes three parameters: `patient_id`, `medication`.\n\n3. Inside the method, it first checks if the `patient_id` exists in the `patients` dictionary using `self.patients.get(patient_id)`.\n\n4. If the `health_status` for that `patient_id` is 'Sick', it changes the status to 'Under Treatment' and returns 'Medication Prescribed'.\n\n5. If the `health_status` is not 'Sick', it returns 'Medication Not Necessary'.\n\nGiven the problem statement, we need to determine if a patient with a health_status of 'Sick' will have medication prescribed when calling `prescribe_medication`.\n\n- According to the logic in the `prescribe_medication` method, if the patient's health status is 'Sick', the method will change their status to 'Under Treatment' and return 'Medication Prescribed'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
