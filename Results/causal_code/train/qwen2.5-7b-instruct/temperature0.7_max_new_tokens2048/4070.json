    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `TrafficLightController` is initialized with `red_light=True`, `yellow_light=False`, and `green_light=False`.\n   - The initial state is set to `'RED'`.\n\n2. **First Command ('NEXT')**:\n   - The state changes from `'RED'` to `'GREEN'`.\n   - `red_light` is set to `False`.\n   - `green_light` is set to `True`.\n\n3. **Second Command ('NEXT')**:\n   - The state changes from `'GREEN'` to `'YELLOW'`.\n   - `green_light` is set to `False`.\n   - `yellow_light` is set to `True`.\n\n4. **Third Command ('RESET')**:\n   - The state returns to `'RED'`.\n   - Both `green_light` and `yellow_light` are set to `False`.\n   - `red_light` is set to `True`.\n\nFrom the above steps, we can see that after the second command ('NEXT'), the `yellow_light` turns on.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial state is 'RED', with red_light set to True and yellow_light/green_light set to False.\n\n2. The first call to `change_light('NEXT')` changes the state from 'RED' to 'GREEN'.\n   - This sets red_light to False and green_light to True.\n   - State becomes 'GREEN'.\n\n3. The second call to `change_light('NEXT')` is made while the state is 'GREEN'.\n   - According to the code, when the state is 'GREEN' and 'NEXT' is called, the state should change to 'YELLOW'.\n   - This sets green_light to False and yellow_light to True.\n\n4. The third call to `change_light('RESET')` resets the state to 'RED'.\n   - However, this does not affect the yellow_light, which was just turned on in the previous step.\n\nTherefore, setting the command to 'NEXT' when starting in state 'GREEN' does indeed result in the yellow light turning on.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial state is set to 'RED' with `self.state = 'RED'` in the constructor.\n\n2. We then call `change_light('NEXT')`:\n   - Since the state is 'RED', it changes to 'GREEN'.\n   - Red light is turned off (`self.red_light = False`).\n   - Green light is turned on (`self.green_light = True`).\n\n3. Next, we call `change_light('NEXT')` again:\n   - Now the state is 'GREEN', so it should change to 'YELLOW'.\n   - Green light is turned off (`self.green_light = False`).\n   - Yellow light is turned on (`self.yellow_light = True`).\n\n4. Finally, we call `change_light('RESET')`:\n   - This resets the state to 'RED'.\n   - Both green and yellow lights are turned off.\n   - Red light is turned on.\n\nThe key point here is that the second call to `change_light('NEXT')` changes the state from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW', which means the yellow light does turn on during this process.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `controller` is initialized with `red_light=True`, `yellow_light=False`, `green_light=False`.\n   - The initial state of the traffic light is set to 'RED'.\n\n2. **First Command ('NEXT')**:\n   - Since the initial state is 'RED', executing `controller.change_light('NEXT')` changes the state to 'GREEN'.\n   - The `red_light` is set to `False`, and the `green_light` is set to `True`.\n\n3. **Second Command ('NEXT')**:\n   - Now, the state is 'GREEN'.\n   - Executing `controller.change_light('NEXT')` changes the state to 'YELLOW'.\n   - The `green_light` is set to `False`, and the `yellow_light` is set to `True`.\n\n4. **Third Command ('RESET')**:\n   - This command resets the state to 'RED'.\n   - Both `green_light` and `yellow_light` are set to `False`, and `red_light` is set to `True`.\n\nAfter executing all commands, we see that the state transitions correctly through the sequence 'RED -> GREEN -> YELLOW -> RED'. Specifically, the second 'NEXT' command indeed results in the yellow light turning on.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficLightController` is initialized with:\n   - Red light on (`True`)\n   - Yellow light off (`False`)\n   - Green light off (`False`)\n\n2. The initial state of the controller is set to 'RED'.\n\n3. The first call to `change_light('NEXT')`:\n   - Changes the state from 'RED' to 'GREEN'\n   - Turns off the red light\n   - Turns on the green light\n\n4. The second call to `change_light('NEXT')`:\n   - Since the current state is 'GREEN', it changes the state to 'YELLOW'\n   - Turns off the green light\n   - Turns on the yellow light\n\n5. The third call to `change_light('RESET')`:\n   - Resets the state to 'RED'\n   - Turns off all lights (green and yellow) and turns on the red light\n\nAfter these steps, we can see that the yellow light was turned on during the second call to `change_light('NEXT')`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
