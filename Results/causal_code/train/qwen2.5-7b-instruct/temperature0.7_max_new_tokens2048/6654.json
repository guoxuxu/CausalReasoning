    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `applyExtraDiscount` method modifies the `discountRate` instance variable.\n2. This method takes an additional parameter `extra`, which is added to the current `discountRate`.\n3. If the new `discountRate` exceeds 0.5, it is set to 0.5.\n4. The `calculateDiscountedRevenue` method uses the `discountRate` to compute the discounted revenue.\n5. Since `calculateDiscountedRevenue` relies on the `discountRate`, any change to `discountRate` will directly impact the result of `calculateDiscountedRevenue`.\n\nTherefore, calling `applyExtraDiscount` will indeed affect the output of `calculateDiscountedRevenue`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding `applyExtraDiscount` Method**:\n   - This method takes an additional discount rate (`extra`) and adds it to the current `discountRate`.\n   - If the new `discountRate` exceeds 0.5, it is capped at 0.5.\n\n2. **Impact on `calculateDiscountedRevenue`**:\n   - The `calculateDiscountedRevenue` method uses the `discountRate` to calculate the discounted revenue.\n   - It computes the average sales and then applies the `discountRate` to this average to get the discounted revenue.\n\n3. **Sequence of Events**:\n   - If `applyExtraDiscount` is called, it modifies the `discountRate`.\n   - This modified `discountRate` will be used in subsequent calls to `calculateDiscountedRevenue`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since `calculateDiscountedRevenue` relies on the current value of `discountRate`, any change to `discountRate` via `applyExtraDiscount` will indeed affect the output of `calculateDiscountedRevenue`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
