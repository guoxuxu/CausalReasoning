    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `analyze_temperature` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2.

In the given data, the temperatures are [72, 78, 81, 68, 70].\n5. To determine the average, we sum these temperatures and divide by the number of temperatures:\n   - Sum = 72 + 78 + 81 + 68 + 70 = 379\n   - Number of temperatures = 5\n   - Average temperature = 379 / 5 = 75.8\n6. Since the average temperature (75.8) is greater than 75, the result should be 'hot'.\n7. However, the question asks about the scenario where the result is 'mild'.\n8.
