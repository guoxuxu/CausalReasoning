    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `calculatePollution()` method is called whenever there's a change in the number of cars or factories.\n2. In `calculatePollution()`, the pollution level is calculated as `(cars * 2) + (factories * 5)`.\n3. When the number of cars increases:\n   - The term `(cars * 2)` will increase because we're multiplying the new (larger) number of cars by 2.\n   - The term `(factories * 5)` remains unchanged if the number of factories does not change.\n\nGiven that increasing the number of cars results in an increased term `(cars * 2)` in the pollution calculation formula, the overall pollution level will indeed increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

Even though the `factories` term `(factories * 5)` also contributes to the pollution level, the direct impact of increasing `cars` is still significant due to the multiplication factor of 2.\n\n4.

When the number of cars increases:\n   - The term `(cars * 2)` will increase because it directly multiplies the number of cars by 2.\n   - This means that as the number of cars goes up, the contribution to the pollution level from cars will also go up.\n\n4.
