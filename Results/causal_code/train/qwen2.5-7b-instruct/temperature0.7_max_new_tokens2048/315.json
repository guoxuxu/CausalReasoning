    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_scores` takes a list of scores as input.\n2. It calculates the average score.\n3. It creates a list called `adjustments`, where each element is 10% of the corresponding score in the input list.\n4. It then adds these adjustments to the original scores to create the `corrected_scores`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if we set all elements in 'adjustments' to a fixed higher value:\n\n1. If we set all elements in 'adjustments' to a higher fixed value (let's call it `fixed_value`), the adjustment applied to each score will be increased.\n2. When we add this new, higher adjustment to each score, the resulting `corrected_scores` will be higher than the original scores.\n\nTo illustrate with an example:\n- Original scores: [65, 70, 75, 80]\n- Adjustments (10%): [6.5, 7, 7.5, 8]\n- Corrected scores: [71.5, 77, 82.5, 88]\n\nIf we set the adjustments to a fixed higher value, say 10 points:\n- New adjustments: [10, 10, 10, 10]\n- New corrected scores: [75, 80, 85, 90]\n\nAs we can see, the new corrected scores are indeed higher than the original scores.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
