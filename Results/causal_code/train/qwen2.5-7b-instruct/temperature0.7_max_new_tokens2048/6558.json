    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a class `SalesAnalyzer` with a member variable `totalSales` of type `int`.\n\n2. The `recordSale` method takes an integer `saleAmount` as its parameter.\n\n3. Inside the `recordSale` method, the line `this.totalSales += saleAmount;` is executed.\n\n4. The `+=` operator in Java is used for addition assignment. It adds the value on the right side to the value on the left side and then assigns the result back to the left side.\n\n5. If `saleAmount` is a positive integer (greater than 0), adding it to `totalSales` will increase the value of `totalSales`.\n\n6. Therefore, if `recordSale` is called with a positive integer, `totalSales` will indeed increase.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
