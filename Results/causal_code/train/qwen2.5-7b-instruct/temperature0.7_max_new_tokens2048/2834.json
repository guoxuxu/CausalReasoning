    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_order` takes four parameters: `item_id`, `quantity`, `inventory`, and `pending_orders`.\n\n2. It first checks if the available quantity of the item in the inventory is greater than or equal to the requested quantity.\n\n3. If the condition `available >= quantity` is true, it means the item is available in sufficient quantity.\n\n4. In this case, the function reduces the inventory by the ordered quantity and prints a message indicating the order has been processed.\n\n5. If the condition is false (i.e., `available < quantity`), it means the item is not available in sufficient quantity.\n\n6. In this scenario, the function appends the order details (item ID and quantity) to the `pending_orders` list and prints a message indicating the order is pending.\n\n7.
