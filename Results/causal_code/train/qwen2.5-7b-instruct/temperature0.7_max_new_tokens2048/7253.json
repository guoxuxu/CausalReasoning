  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "According to the provided code segment in the 'manage_weather_effect' function, if the 'day' variable is set to 'rainy', the 'mood' is directly set as 'gloomy'. Thus, there's a direct causal effect from the type of day to the mood without any intervention.",
  "causal_map": "day → mood; sunny → happy; rainy → gloomy; mood → productivity",
  "causal_map_integration": "The day's weather directly influences mood; specifically, a rainy day causes a gloomy mood. Mood then directly influences productivity, with a gloomy mood leading to lower productivity.",
