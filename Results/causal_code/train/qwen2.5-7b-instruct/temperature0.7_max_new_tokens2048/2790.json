    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `increaseTemperature()` method checks if the heater is not already on (`if (!heaterStatus)`).\n2.

Regardless of whether the heater was on or off initially, the method then increases the temperature by 5 degrees.\n\nGiven this logic, we can conclude that:\n- If the temperature is increased, the method first checks the current state of the heater.\n- If the heater is off, it gets turned on before increasing the temperature.\n\nTherefore, if the temperature has been increased, the heater must have been turned on.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `increaseTemperature` method is called.\n2. Inside this method:\n   - It first checks if `heaterStatus` is false.\n   - If it is, `heaterStatus` is set to true.\n   - Then, the temperature is increased by 5 degrees.\n\n3. The key point here is that the heater is only turned on if it wasn't already on when the `increaseTemperature` method was called.\n\n4. We need to consider two scenarios:\n   - If the heater was off before calling `increaseTemperature`, it will be turned on.\n   - If the heater was already on, it won't be turned on again.\n\n5. The question asks if the temperature increased, was the heater turned on?\n   - This implies we're looking at the state after an increase.\n   - If the temperature increased, it means the `increaseTemperature` method was called.\n   - However, just because the temperature increased doesn't necessarily mean the heater was off initially.\n\n6. The initial state of `heaterStatus` is false (as per the constructor), but we don't have information about its state before the method call.\n\n7.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `increaseTemperature` method is called.\n2. Inside `increaseTemperature`, there's an `if` statement that checks `!heaterStatus`.\n3.
