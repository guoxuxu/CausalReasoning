    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `adjust_temperature` determines whether the heater should be turned on based on the current environmental temperature (`env_temp`) and the temperature setting (`temp_setting`).\n\n2. The condition for turning on the heater is `if env_temp < temp_setting - 2:`.\n\n3. Given:\n   - `env_temp` is now 24 (as per the problem statement).\n   - `temp_setting` is 23.\n\n4. Plugging these values into the condition:\n   - `24 < 23 - 2` simplifies to `24 < 21`, which is false.\n\n5. Since the condition is false, the code inside the `if` block will not execute, and `heater_on` will be set to `False`.\n\nTherefore, with an environmental temperature of 24 and a temperature setting of 23, the heater will not turn on.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",

Given the parameters:\n   - `env_temp` has risen to 24.\n   - `temp_setting` is still 23.\n\n4.
