    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Discount Rate**: The `discount_rate` is set to 0.05 if `is_member` is `True`. This means that when `is_member` is `True`, `discount_rate` starts at 0.05.\n\n2. **Promo Code Check**: If `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', then `discount_rate` gets an additional 0.2. However, this only happens if `is_member` is `True`.\n\n3. **Final Discount Rate Calculation**:\n   - If `is_member` is `True` and `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', then `discount_rate` becomes 0.05 + 0.2 = 0.25.\n   - If `is_member` is `True` but `promo_code` is not 'SAVE20', then `discount_rate` remains 0.05.\n\nGiven these steps, we can see that when `is_member` is `True`, the `discount_rate` can be either 0.05 or 0.25. It does not necessarily have to be at least 0.05 because it can remain at 0.05 without the 'SAVE20' promo code.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_discount` takes three parameters:\n   - `prices`: a list of prices\n   - `is_member`: a boolean indicating if the customer is a member\n   - `promo_code`: a string representing a promotional code\n\n2. The discount rate is initially set to 0.05 if `is_member` is True.\n\n3. If `is_member` is False, the discount rate remains 0.0 (as specified).\n\n4. Regardless of the initial value of `is_member`, the function checks if `promo_code` is 'SAVE20'.\n\n5. If `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', the discount rate increases by 0.2.\n\n6. Let's consider both cases:\n   - If `is_member` is True, the discount rate starts at 0.05.\n   - If `is_member` is False, the discount rate starts at 0.0.\n\n7. In either case, if the `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', the discount rate will increase by 0.2.\n\n8. Therefore, if `is_member` is True and `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', the final discount rate will be 0.05 + 0.2 = 0.25.\n\n9. Even if `is_member` is False and `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', the final discount rate will be 0.0 + 0.2 = 0.2.\n\nIn all scenarios where `is_member` is True and `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', the discount rate will indeed be at least 0.05.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `discount_rate` is initially set to `0.05` if `is_member` is `True`.\n2. If `is_member` is `False`, the `discount_rate` starts as `0.0`.\n3. There is an additional condition where if `promo_code` is `'SAVE20'`, the `discount_rate` increases by `0.2`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `is_member` is `True`:\n- In this case, the `discount_rate` is immediately set to `0.05`.\n- The `promo_code` condition does not change this because it only adds `0.2` to the `discount_rate` if `promo_code` is `'SAVE20'`, which is irrelevant when `is_member` is already `True`.\n\nTherefore, if `is_member` is `True`, the `discount_rate` will be `0.05` and will not increase further based on the `promo_code` condition.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

There is an additional condition where if `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', the discount rate increases by 0.2.\n\n5. We need to determine if `is_member` being True guarantees that `discount_rate` will be at least 0.05.\n\n6. If `is_member` is True, `discount_rate` is set to 0.05. This means it starts at 0.05.\n\n7. However, there's no condition that prevents the `SAVE20` promo code from being applied even when `is_member` is True. If `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', the discount rate can increase to 0.25 (0.05 + 0.2).\n\n8. Therefore, while `is_member` being True sets the discount rate to 0.05 initially, the presence of the 'SAVE20' promo code can override this, potentially setting the discount rate to a higher value.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
