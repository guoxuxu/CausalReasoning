    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Base Score Calculation**:\n   - For individuals under 30 years old, the base score is 80.\n   - For individuals 30 years and older, the base score is 70.\n\n2. **Activity Score Calculation**:\n   - If activity level is greater than 7, the score is 20.\n   - Otherwise, it is 10.\n\n3. **Diet Score Calculation**:\n   - If diet quality is 'good', the score is 30.\n   - If diet quality is 'average', the score is 20.\n   - Otherwise, it is 10.\n\n4. **Health Score Calculation**:\n   - The health score is the sum of the base score, activity score, and diet score.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we set diet quality to 'good' for all individuals:\n\n- For individuals under 30, their base score is 80. If we set their diet quality to 'good', they get an additional 30 points from the diet score. Their total health score would be \\(80 + 20 + 30 = 130\\).\n- For individuals 30 and older, their base score is 70. With a 'good' diet quality, their diet score becomes 30, making their total health score \\(70 + 10 + 30 = 110\\).\n\nBefore changing the diet quality, the highest possible health score for individuals under 30 is \\(80 + 20 + 20 = 120\\) (if activity level is 7 or more), and for those 30 and older, it is \\(70 + 10 + 20 = 100\\) (if activity level is 7 or more).\n\nBy setting diet quality to 'good' for everyone, we increase the maximum possible health score for both groups by 10 points (from 120 to 130 for under 30s, and from 100 to 110 for 30+). \n\nSince the average health score can only increase or stay the same with this change (and not decrease), the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Therefore, the average health score would not increase because the highest possible health score does not change.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
