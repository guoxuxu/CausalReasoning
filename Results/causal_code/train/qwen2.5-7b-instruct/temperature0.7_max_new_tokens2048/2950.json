    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data(data)` takes an input `data`.\n2. Inside the function, `scaled_data` is calculated as `data * 10`. This means that `scaled_data` will be directly proportional to `data`.\n3. Then, `result` is calculated as `scaled_data + 5`. Since `scaled_data` is directly proportional to `data`, adding 5 will not affect the proportionality.\n4. If we increase the value of `data`, both `scaled_data` and `result` will increase proportionally.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific case where the initial value of `data` is 3:\n- `scaled_data = 3 * 10 = 30`\n- `result = 30 + 5 = 35`\n\nIf we increase `data` to, for example, 4:\n- `scaled_data = 4 * 10 = 40`\n- `result = 40 + 5 = 45`\n\nWe can see that when `data` increases from 3 to 4, `output` (which is the same as `result` in this context) also increases from 35 to 45.\n\nTherefore, if the value of 'data' is increased, 'output' will also increase, without any other intervention.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Then it adds 5 to `scaled_data`, giving us the `result`.\n4. If we increase the value of `data`, both steps in the function will be affected:\n   - Multiplying by 10 will yield a larger number.\n   - Adding 5 to this larger number will still produce a larger result than before.\n5. Therefore, if `data` increases, every step in the function will produce a larger intermediate or final value.\n\nGiven that all operations in the function are linear and additive, increasing `data` will indeed lead to an increase in `output`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Since multiplication and addition are both monotonic operations (they preserve the order of numbers), increasing `data` will result in a larger output.\n\nTherefore, if the value of 'data' is increased, 'output' will also increase, assuming no other interventions.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
