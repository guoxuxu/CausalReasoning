    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `willItRain()` method calculates the `rainProbability` based on the current values of `humidity` and `temperature`.\n\n2. There are three conditions to consider:\n   - If `humidity > 70` and `temperature < 20`, then `rainProbability` is set to 80.\n   - If `humidity > 50` but not necessarily greater than 70, then `rainProbability` is set to 50.\n   - Otherwise, `rainProbability` is set to 20.\n\n3. The `increaseHumidity(value)` method simply adds a given value to the current `humidity`.\n\n4. We need to determine if increasing humidity will always result in an increase in `rainProbability`.\n\n5. Let's analyze the conditions:\n   - Increasing humidity from 69 to 71 would make it fall into the first condition (`humidity > 70`), which sets `rainProbability` to 80.\n   - Increasing humidity from 49 to 51 would make it fall into the second condition (`humidity > 50`), which sets `rainProbability` to 50.\n   - Increasing humidity from 20 to 51 would only affect the `rainProbability` if the temperature is less than 20, otherwise, it would remain at 20.\n\n6. However, if we increase humidity from 51 to 71 while keeping the temperature above 20, the `rainProbability` would decrease from 50 to 20.\n\nTherefore, increasing humidity does not necessarily lead to an increase in `rainProbability`. \n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The `increaseHumidity(value)` method simply adds a given value to the current `humidity`.\n\n6. Now, let's consider scenarios where increasing humidity does not necessarily increase the rain probability:\n   - If the initial humidity is 50 or less, increasing it to just above 50 will result in a `rainProbability` of 50.\n   - If the initial humidity is between 50 and 70, increasing it could keep the `rainProbability` at 50 if it doesn't reach 70.\n   - If the initial humidity is already above 70, increasing it further might not change the `rainProbability` as it is capped at 80.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that an increase in humidity does not always lead to an increase in rain probability.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
