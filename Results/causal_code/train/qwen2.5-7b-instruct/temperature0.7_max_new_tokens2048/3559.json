  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "A decrease in final_price can not solely be attributed to a decrease in base_price as it might also result from an increase in discount. Therefore, without knowing the change in discount, the cause of the change in final_price cannot be definitively attributed to the change in base_price.",
  "causal_map": "discount → final_price; coupon_value → discount; base_price → final_price",
  "causal_map_integration": "The final price is influenced by the base price, discount, and the applied coupon value. Specifically, the discount and the applied coupon value directly reduce the final price, while the base price sets the initial value from which discounts and coupons are applied.",

When the discount increases from 10% to 15%, the `final_price` decreases because the `final_price` is calculated as `base_price * (1 - discount/100)`.\n\n4. **Base Price Role**: The `base_price` remains unchanged at 100 throughout the process. The only change affecting the `final_price` is the increase in the discount due to the coupon application.\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `discount → final_price`: An increase in the discount leads to a decrease in the `final_price`.\n   - `coupon_value → discount`: Applying a coupon increases the discount.\n   - `base_price → final_price`: The `base_price` influences the `final_price`, but it does not change during the process described.\n\n6. **Observation**: If the `final_price` decreases, it must be due to the increased discount caused by applying the coupon, not a change in the `base_price`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot conclude that the `base_price` was decreased without any other interventions.
