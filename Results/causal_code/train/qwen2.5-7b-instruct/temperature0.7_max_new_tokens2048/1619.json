    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: \n   - `logistics = LogisticsSystem('rainy', 'heavy')`\n   - The initial weather condition is 'rainy'.\n   - The initial traffic status is 'heavy'.\n\n2. **Daily Operations Check**:\n   - The method `daily_operations()` checks if both conditions are 'clear' and 'light'.\n   - Since the initial conditions are 'rainy' and 'heavy', `daily_operations()` returns `False`.\n\n3. **Adjust Schedule**:\n   - The method `adjust_schedule('clear', 'light')` updates the weather conditions to 'clear' and the traffic status to 'light'.\n   - This method returns `True`, indicating that the schedule was successfully adjusted.\n\n4. **Predict Delivery Success**:\n   - `predict_delivery_success()` first calls `adjust_schedule('clear', 'light')` which sets the conditions to 'clear' and 'light'.\n   - Then it calls `daily_operations()`, which now checks the updated conditions.\n   - With the conditions set to 'clear' and 'light', `daily_operations()` returns `True`.\n\nTherefore, changing the weather condition to 'clear' does indeed lead to successful daily operations.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
