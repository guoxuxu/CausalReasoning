  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Intervening to set all temperatures above 30 directly impacts the calculation of 'cold_days', effectively filtering out any days that could be considered cold. This manipulation of the original cause (data's temperatures) leads to a specific effect (cold days count) with intervention.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `analyze_temperatures` calculates the average temperature from a list of temperature data.\n\n2.

The `cold_days_count` in the result dictionary is the length of the `cold_days` list.\n\n4.
