  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the quantity directly increases the returned value of the function processOrder (either doubled or not based on membership), with the membership status unchanged. The function directly multiplies the input quantity by 2 if the user is a member, otherwise it returns the quantity as is.",
  "causal_map": "quantity → resultant order value; isMember → resultant order value",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the quantity of an order directly increases the resultant order value, regardless of membership status. Membership status indirectly influences the resultant order value only when the quantity is increased.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `processOrder` takes two parameters:\n   - `quantity`: an integer representing the number of items ordered.\n   - `isMember`: a boolean indicating whether the user is a member.\n\n2. If `isMember` is true, the function returns `quantity * 2`.\n3. If `isMember` is false, the function returns `quantity`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the quantity changes:\n\n4. If the user is a member (`isMember = true`):\n   - Increasing the quantity will result in a higher order value because it is multiplied by 2.\n5.

    "Let's break down the function `processOrder` to understand how it works:\n\n1. The function takes two parameters: `quantity` (an integer representing the number of items ordered) and `isMember` (a boolean indicating whether the user is a member).\n\n2. If `isMember` is true, the function returns `quantity * 2`. This means that for members, the order value is doubled based on the quantity.\n\n3.
