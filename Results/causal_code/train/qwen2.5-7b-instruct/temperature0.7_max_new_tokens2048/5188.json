    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `isWaterBoiling()` method checks two conditions:\n   - `isPowerOn` must be true\n   - The temperature must be at least 100\n\n2. If the method returns true (indicating water is boiling), both of these conditions must be met.\n\n3. For water to be considered boiling according to the class definition, the power must indeed be on (`isPowerOn` must be true).\n\n4. Therefore, if the `isWaterBoiling()` method returns true, we can conclude that the power is on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

For `isWaterBoiling()` to return true, both conditions must be met:\n   - `isPowerOn` must be true\n   - `temperature` must be at least 100\n5.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to understand the conditions for water to be considered \"boiling\" based on the `isWaterBoiling()` method.\n2.

Even if the temperature is at or above 100 degrees, if the power is not on, the condition for boiling would still not be met.\n\nTherefore, if the WaterBoiler shows that water is boiling, we can conclude that the power must be on because the method explicitly requires `isPowerOn` to be true.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if the WaterBoiler showing that water is boiling (i.e., `isWaterBoiling()` returns `true`) implies that the power is on (`isPowerOn`).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Causal Relationships**:\n   - `isPowerOn` directly affects the `temperature`.\n   - `isPowerOn` directly affects whether `isWaterBoiling()` returns `true`.\n   - If `isPowerOn` is `false`, then `temperature` will be reset to 20 when `turnOff()` is called.\n   - If `isPowerOn` is `false`, and the current `temperature` is greater than 20, it will decrease by 3.\n\n3. **Conditions for Boiling**:\n   - For `isWaterBoiling()` to be `true`, both conditions must hold:\n     - `isPowerOn` must be `true`.\n     - The `temperature` must be at least 100 degrees.\n\n4. **Considering the Scenario Where Water Is Boiling**:\n   - If `isWaterBoiling()` returns `true`, then `isPowerOn` must be `true` (since turning off the power would immediately stop the heating process).\n   - Additionally, the `temperature` must be at least 100 degrees.\n\nGiven these points, if the WaterBoiler indicates that the water is boiling, it logically follows that the power must be on because the boiling condition cannot be met without the power being on.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
