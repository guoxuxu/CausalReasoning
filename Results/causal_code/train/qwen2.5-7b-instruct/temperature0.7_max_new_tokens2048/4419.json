    "Let's break down the logic of the `promotion_eligibility` function step by step using the provided example:\n\n1. **Performance Score**: The person has a performance score of 90.\n   - Since 90 is greater than or equal to 85, we move to the next condition.\n\n2. **Years of Service**: The person has 6 years of service.\n   - Since 6 is greater than 5, we move to the next condition.\n\n3. **Managerial Experience**: The person has managerial experience.\n   - Since this condition is true, the function returns 'Eligible for Senior Management Promotion'.\n\nGiven these steps, the function would indeed return 'Eligible for Senior Management Promotion' for the given inputs.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `promotion_eligibility` function step by step:\n\n1. The function checks if the `performance_score` is greater than or equal to 85.\n2. If it is, the function then checks if `years_of_service` is greater than 5.\n3. If both conditions are met, the function further checks if the person has `managerial_experience`.\n4. If all conditions are satisfied (performance score >= 85, years of service > 5, and managerial experience), the person is eligible for a \"Senior Management Promotion\".\n\nGiven the example inputs:\n- `performance_score = 90`\n- `years_of_service = 6`\n- `managerial_experience = True`\n\nWe can see that:\n- The performance score of 90 is indeed >= 85.\n- The years of service of 6 are indeed > 5.\n- The person does have managerial experience.\n\nSince all these conditions are met, the function will return 'Eligible for Senior Management Promotion'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `promotion_eligibility` takes three parameters:\n   - `performance_score`\n   - `years_of_service`\n   - `managerial_experience`\n\n2. We need to evaluate the conditions within the function for a performance score of 90, 6 years of service, and managerial experience.\n\n3. First, check if the performance score is greater than or equal to 85:\n   - 90 >= 85 is True\n\n4. Since the performance score condition is met, we move to the next condition:\n   - Check if the years of service are greater than 5:\n     - 6 > 5 is True\n\n5. Now that both the performance score and years of service conditions are met, we check the third condition:\n   - Check if there is managerial experience:\n     - Managerial_experience is True (given)\n\n6. According to the function logic, if all these conditions are met, the function returns \"Eligible for Senior Management Promotion\".\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The function `promotion_eligibility` takes three parameters: `performance_score`, `years_of_service`, and `managerial_experience`.\n\n2. We are given the following values:\n   - `performance_score = 90`\n   - `years_of_service = 6`\n   - `managerial_experience = True`\n\n3. The function first checks if the `performance_score` is greater than or equal to 85.\n   - Since 90 >= 85, this condition is true.\n\n4. Next, it checks if the `years_of_service` is greater than 5.\n   - Since 6 > 5, this condition is also true.\n\n5. Finally, it checks if the `managerial_experience` is `True`.\n   - Since `managerial_experience` is `True`, this condition is true as well.\n\n6. According to the function's logic, if all these conditions are met, the function returns 'Eligible for Senior Management Promotion'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `promotion_eligibility` checks the performance score first.\n2. The performance score provided is 90, which is greater than or equal to 85.\n3. Since the performance score is valid, the function then checks the years of service.\n4. The years of service provided are 6, which is greater than 5.\n5. The function then checks for managerial experience.\n6. Managerial experience is provided as `True`.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can see that all criteria for a \"Senior Management Promotion\" are met:\n\n- Performance score is 90 (>= 85)\n- Years of service is 6 (> 5)\n- Managerial experience is present (True)\n\nTherefore, the function should return 'Eligible for Senior Management Promotion'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
