  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "In the code, 'access_level' is set to 'high' only when 'user' is equal to 'admin'. Thus, seeing a 'high' access level directly indicates that the input for 'user' was 'admin'.",

  "causal_map_integration": "If data['user'] is 'admin', then data['access_level'] becomes 'high'; if data['user'] is not 'admin', then data['access_level'] becomes 'low'; the presence of 'error' in data leads to data['status'] being set to 'failed'.",
