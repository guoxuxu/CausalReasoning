  "Explanation": "The accelerate method includes a check to ensure that the car's speed does not exceed 120. Whenever the speed reaches or exceeds 120, it is set to 120. Therefore, calling the accelerate method does not guarantee that the speed will always exceed 120, but it will ensure that it does not.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `accelerate` method takes an `increment` parameter.\n2. It adds this `increment` to the current speed of the car.\n3. If the resulting speed exceeds 120, it is capped at 120.\n\nNow, let's consider scenarios where the speed might not exceed 120:\n\n- If the initial speed is already 120 or more, any positive increment will be capped at 120.\n- If the initial speed is less than 120, the increment must be large enough to reach 120 for the speed to exceed 120 after acceleration.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee that the increment provided will be large enough to exceed 120. For example, if the initial speed is 50 and the increment is only 5, the new speed would be 55, which does not exceed 120.\n\nTherefore, the car's speed does not always exceed 120 when the `accelerate` method is called.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

This means that no matter how large the `increment` value is, the speed can never go above 120.\n\n4. For example, if the current speed is 100 and we call `accelerate(50)`, the new speed would be 150, but it is then capped at 120.\n\n5. Similarly, if the current speed is 110 and we call `accelerate(30)`, the new speed would be 140, but again, it is capped at 120.\n\n6.
