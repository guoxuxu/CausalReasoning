  "Explanation": "Although the speedLimit increasing with the traffic light set to green suggests lower density impacts (as high density would otherwise set it to 45), the intervention of keeping the light always green negates the normal signal logic that would lower the limit in high density, thus we cannot infer density directly.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `speedLimit` can be adjusted based on two factors:\n   - Whether the traffic light is red\n   - The traffic density\n\n2.

The question states that the speed limit increased after an intervention to keep the traffic light green (always `false` for `trafficLightRed`).\n\n4. If `trafficLightRed` is always `false`, the only way the speed limit could change is due to changes in `trafficDensity`.\n\n5. For the speed limit to increase from 30 (when the light is red) to 60 (the default when the light is green), `trafficDensity` must be reduced below 50.\n\n6.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `adjustSpeedLimit` method determines the `speedLimit` based on two factors:\n   - Whether the `trafficLightRed` is true or false.\n   - The value of `trafficDensity`.\n\n2. The `recordTrafficDensity` method updates the `trafficDensity` and then calls `adjustSpeedLimit`.\n\n3.

For the speed limit to increase from whatever it was previously (which could be 30 or 45 depending on previous conditions), the only way this can happen is if `trafficDensity` is now less than or equal to 50 (since the minimum speed limit when `trafficDensity > 50` is 45).\n\n7.
