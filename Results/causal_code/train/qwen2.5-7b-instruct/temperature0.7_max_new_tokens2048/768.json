    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `forecast` method in `WeatherController` takes a `location` as input.\n2.

The `forecast` method checks if the `temperature` attribute of the returned `Weather` object is greater than 25.\n5. If the condition `data.temperature > 25` is true, the method returns a string indicating it will be hot.\n\nGiven the provided code, if `getWeatherData` indeed returns a `Weather` object with a `temperature` attribute greater than 25, then the condition `data.temperature > 25` will evaluate to true.\n\nTherefore, the `forecast` method will return a string indicating it will be hot.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
