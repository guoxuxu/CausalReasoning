    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `weather_condition` function randomly selects from three possible weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. The `traffic_update` function determines the traffic based on the weather:\n   - If the weather is 'rainy', the traffic is set to 'heavy'.\n   - If the weather is 'sunny', the traffic is set to 'light'.\n   - For any other weather condition ('cloudy'), the traffic is set to 'moderate'.\n\n3. The `decision_to_travel` function checks the traffic condition and returns `False` if the traffic is 'heavy', indicating that travel should not occur.\n\n4. To determine if heavy traffic implies rainy weather, we need to trace back from the traffic condition to the weather condition.\n\n5. From the `traffic_update` function, we can see that traffic is only set to 'heavy' when the weather is specifically 'rainy'. For all other weather conditions (sunny or cloudy), the traffic is not set to 'heavy'.\n\n6.
