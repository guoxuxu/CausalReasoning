    "Let's break down the computation of the `base_score` step by step to understand how it changes with an increase in `years_of_experience`.\n\n1. **Age Adjustment**: \n   - `age_adjustment = data['age'] * 0.1`\n   - This part remains constant if the `age` does not change.\n\n2. **Experience**:\n   - `experience = data['years_of_experience'] - data['years_of_unemployment'] * 0.5`\n   - The term `data['years_of_experience']` directly contributes positively to the `experience`.\n   - The term `data['years_of_unemployment'] * 0.5` contributes negatively to the `experience`.\n\n3. **Base Score Calculation**:\n   - `base_score = 70 + experience + age_adjustment`\n   - Since `age_adjustment` is constant (assuming no change in age), the change in `base_score` will primarily depend on the change in `experience`.\n\n4. **Effect of Increasing `years_of_experience`**:\n   - If `years_of_experience` increases while `years_of_unemployment` remains constant, the `experience` value will increase.\n   - As `experience` increases, the `base_score` will also increase because `base_score` is directly dependent on `experience`.\n\nTherefore, if `years_of_experience` increases, we can expect `base_score` to also increase, assuming other factors remain constant.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the components of the base score**:\n   - Base score is calculated as `70 + experience + age_adjustment`.\n   - `experience` is derived from `data['years_of_experience'] - data['years_of_unemployment'] * 0.5`.\n   - `age_adjustment` is derived from `data['age'] * 0.1`.\n\n2. **Analyze how 'years_of_experience' affects the base score**:\n   - The `experience` component directly includes `years_of_experience`.\n   - Therefore, an increase in `years_of_experience` will lead to an increase in the value of `experience`.\n\n3. **Consider the effect on the base score**:\n   - Since `experience` is added directly to the base score (`70 + experience + age_adjustment`), any increase in `experience` will result in a corresponding increase in the base score.\n\n4. **Assume other factors remain constant**:\n   - If we assume that `age`, `years_of_unemployment`, and `has_degree` (if applicable) remain unchanged, then only the change in `years_of_experience` will affect the base score.\n\nGiven this analysis, if `years_of_experience` increases, the `experience` component will increase, leading to a higher base score.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the function `compute_scores` step by step to understand how changes in 'years_of_experience' affect 'base_score'.\n\n1. **Age Adjustment**: The age adjustment is calculated as `data['age'] * 0.1`. This term does not depend on 'years_of_experience', so it remains constant for a given age.\n\n2. **Experience Term**: The experience term is calculated as `data['years_of_experience'] - data['years_of_unemployment'] * 0.5`. Here, we see that 'years_of_experience' directly contributes positively to this term. If 'years_of_experience' increases, the value of this term will increase, assuming 'years_of_unemployment' remains constant.\n\n3. **Base Score Calculation**: The base score is calculated as `70 + experience + age_adjustment`. Since the experience term is positively influenced by an increase in 'years_of_experience', an increase in 'years_of_experience' will lead to an increase in the base score, provided that 'years_of_unemployment' does not change significantly enough to offset the positive effect.\n\n4. **Degree Factor**: The presence of a degree (i.e., `data['has_degree']`) adds 15 points to the base score but does not depend on 'years_of_experience'. Therefore, this factor does not influence our analysis regarding the effect of 'years_of_experience' on 'base_score'.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, if 'years_of_experience' increases while all other factors remain constant, the 'base_score' should also increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Base Score Calculation**:\n   - The base score is calculated as `70 + experience + age_adjustment`.\n   - `experience` is defined as `data['years_of_experience'] - data['years_of_unemployment'] * 0.5`.\n\n2. **Effect of `years_of_experience`**:\n   - If `years_of_experience` increases, it directly adds to the `experience` value.\n   - The formula for `experience` shows that an increase in `years_of_experience` will result in a positive contribution to the `base_score`.\n\n3. **Other Factors**:\n   - The question states to assume other factors remain constant. This means we can ignore changes in `age`, `years_of_unemployment`, and whether `has_degree` is true or false.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since increasing `years_of_experience` increases the `experience` component, which is added to the base score, we can conclude that an increase in `years_of_experience` will lead to an increase in `base_score`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the function to understand how each component contributes to the `base_score`.\n\n1. **Age Adjustment**: \n   - `age_adjustment = data['age'] * 0.1`\n   - This means that for every year of age, there is an additional 0.1 points added to the score.\n\n2. **Experience Component**:\n   - `experience = data['years_of_experience'] - data['years_of_unemployment'] * 0.5`\n   - The score from experience is calculated as the years of experience minus half the years of unemployment.\n   - If `years_of_experience` increases while `years_of_unemployment` remains constant, the experience value will increase, leading to an increase in the base score.\n\n3. **Base Score Calculation**:\n   - `base_score = 70 + experience + age_adjustment`\n   - The base score starts at 70 and then adds the experience value and the age adjustment.\n\n4. **Degree Bonus**:\n   - If `data['has_degree']` is True, 15 points are added to the base score.\n\nGiven this breakdown, let's reason about the effect of increasing `years_of_experience`:\n\n- Increasing `years_of_experience` directly increases the `experience` value, which is added to the base score.\n- The age adjustment and degree bonus remain unchanged if other factors are constant.\n\nTherefore, with all other factors held constant, an increase in `years_of_experience` should result in an increase in the `base_score`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
