  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Setting `demand_rising` to True results in the calculation `production_units = 100 + cost_increase`, which is higher than the `production_units` calculation when `demand_rising` is False. This directly increases the production count depending on the magnitude of `cost_increase`.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `increase_production` takes two parameters:\n   - `cost_increase`: an integer representing the increase in production cost.\n   - `demand_rising`: a boolean indicating whether demand is rising.\n\n2. We need to consider the scenario where `demand_rising` is set to `True`.\n\n3. When `demand_rising` is `True`, the formula for calculating `production_units` is:\n   `production_units = 100 + cost_increase`\n\n4. Let's analyze what happens with different values of `cost_increase`:\n   - If `cost_increase` is 0: `production_units = 100 + 0 = 100`\n   - If `cost_increase` is positive (e.g., 10): `production_units = 100 + 10 = 110`\n   - If `cost_increase` is negative (e.g., -10): `production_units = 100 - 10 = 90`\n\n5. From the above cases, we can see that when `cost_increase` is positive, `production_units` increases.\n6. However, when `cost_increase` is negative, `production_units` decreases.\n\nTherefore, `production_units` does not necessarily increase when `demand_rising` is set to `True`.
