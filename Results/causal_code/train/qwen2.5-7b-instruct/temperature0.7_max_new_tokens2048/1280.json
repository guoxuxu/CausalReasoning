    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data(data)` checks if 'age' is a key in the input dictionary `data`.\n\n2. If 'age' exists, it sets a new key 'is_adult' based on whether the value of 'age' is greater than or equal to 18.\n\n3. Depending on the value of 'is_adult', it assigns either '20%' or '10%' to the key 'discount'.\n\n4. Specifically, if 'is_adult' is True (meaning the age is 18 or more), the discount is set to '20%'.\n   \n5. If 'is_adult' is False (meaning the age is less than 18), the discount is set to '10%'.\n\nGiven that the question asks if the discount being '10%' allows us to conclude the age is less than 18:\n\n- If the discount is '10%', according to the logic in the code, this can only happen when 'is_adult' is False.\n- 'is_adult' is False when the age is less than 18.\n\nTherefore, if the discount is '10%', we can indeed conclude that the age is less than 18.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
