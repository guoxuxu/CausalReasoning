    "Let's analyze the code step by step to determine if the alarm will trigger when the sensor remains inactive.\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `MotionSensor` class is initialized with `isActive` set to `false` and `detectedMovements` set to `0`.\n\n2. **Activation and Deactivation**:\n   - `activate()` sets `isActive` to `true`.\n   - `deactivate()` sets `isActive` to `false`.\n\n3. **Detecting Movements**:\n   - `detectMovement()` increments `detectedMovements` only if `isActive` is `true`.\n\n4. **Alarm Trigger Condition**:\n   - `isAlarmTriggered()` returns `true` only if both `isActive` is `true` and `detectedMovements` is greater than `5`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the sensor remains inactive:\n\n- If the sensor remains inactive (`isActive` is `false`), then `detectMovement()` will not increment `detectedMovements` because the condition inside `detectMovement()` is not met.\n- Since `isActive` is `false`, the condition for triggering the alarm (`isActive && detectedMovements > 5`) cannot be satisfied because the first part of the condition (`isActive`) is already `false`.\n\nTherefore, if the sensor remains inactive, it will not trigger the alarm.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `MotionSensor` class has a boolean field `isActive` which determines whether the sensor is active.\n2. The `isAlarmTriggered()` method checks two conditions:\n   - `isActive` must be `true`\n   - `detectedMovements` must be greater than 5\n\n3. If the sensor remains inactive (`isActive` is `false`), the first condition of `isAlarmTriggered()` will always be false.\n\n4. Since both conditions need to be met for the alarm to trigger, and one of them is always false when the sensor is inactive, the alarm will not trigger.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `MotionSensor` class has two main conditions for triggering an alarm:\n   - The sensor must be active (`isActive` must be true).\n   - The number of detected movements must be greater than 5 (`detectedMovements > 5`).\n\n2. If the sensor remains inactive:\n   - The `isActive` variable will remain false.\n   - The `detectedMovements` will not increase as long as the sensor is inactive.\n\n3. For the alarm to trigger, both conditions need to be met simultaneously:\n   - The sensor needs to be active (which it isn't).\n   - There needs to be more than 5 detected movements (which won't happen while inactive).\n\n4. Since one of the necessary conditions (being active) is not met when the sensor remains inactive, the alarm cannot be triggered.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The MotionSensor class has an \"isActive\" flag that determines whether the sensor is active.\n2. The \"isAlarmTriggered\" method checks two conditions:\n   a) The sensor must be active (isActive == true)\n   b) More than 5 movements must have been detected (detectedMovements > 5)\n3. If the sensor remains inactive (isActive == false), then the first condition of the \"isAlarmTriggered\" method will always be false.\n4. Since the AND operation requires both conditions to be true for the result to be true, if the first condition is false, the entire expression will be false regardless of the value of detectedMovements.\n\nTherefore, if the sensor remains inactive, it will not trigger the alarm.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
