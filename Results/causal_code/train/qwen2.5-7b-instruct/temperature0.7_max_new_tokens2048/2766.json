    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `SystemHealthChecker` class has three boolean fields:\n   - `isCpuOverloaded`\n   - `isMemoryFull`\n   - `notificationSent`\n\n2. The constructor initializes these fields based on the provided status of CPU and memory.\n\n3. The `checkSystemHealth()` method checks if either the CPU is overloaded (`isCpuOverloaded`) or the memory is full (`isMemoryFull`).\n\n4. If either condition is true, it calls the `sendNotification()` method.\n\n5. The `sendNotification()` method sets the `notificationSent` field to `true`.\n\n6. The `isNotificationSent()` method returns the value of `notificationSent`.\n\nNow, specifically for the question: \"If the CPU is overloaded, will a notification be sent?\"\n\n- If `isCpuOverloaded` is `true`, then the condition in the `checkSystemHealth()` method (`isCpuOverloaded || isMemoryFull`) will evaluate to `true`.\n- When this condition is met, the `sendNotification()` method is called.\n- Calling `sendNotification()` sets `notificationSent` to `true`.\n\nTherefore, if the CPU is overloaded, a notification will indeed be sent.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

To determine if a notification is sent when the CPU is overloaded:\n   - We need to consider the condition in the `checkSystemHealth()` method.\n   - The condition is `if (isCpuOverloaded || isMemoryFull)`.\n\n5. This means that if `isCpuOverloaded` is true, regardless of the value of `isMemoryFull`, the condition will be true.\n\n6.
