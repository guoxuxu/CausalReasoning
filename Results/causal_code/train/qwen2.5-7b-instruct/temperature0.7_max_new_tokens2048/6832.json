    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `adjust_temperature` takes two parameters: `room_temperature` and `thermostat_setting`.\n\n2. It checks if `room_temperature` is less than `thermostat_setting`.\n\n3. If `room_temperature` is less than `thermostat_setting`, it sets `heating_status` to 'on'. Otherwise, it sets `heating_status` to 'off'.\n\n4. However, the problem statement introduces an additional condition: the heating_status is set to 'on' regardless of the comparison result.\n\n5. Regardless of the actual temperature difference, the code now always sets `heating_status` to 'on'.\n\n6. When `heating_status` is 'on', the function adds 5 to `room_temperature`.\n\n7. Therefore, even if `room_temperature` is already equal to or greater than `thermostat_setting`, the function will still add 5 to `room_temperature`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the room temperature will necessarily increase because the heating_status is forced to be 'on', which always results in an increase of 5 degrees in the room temperature.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
