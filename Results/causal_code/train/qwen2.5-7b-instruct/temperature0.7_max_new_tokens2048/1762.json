  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Because being a member (`is_member = True`) activates the `discount = price * discount_rate`, which reduces the `price` by `discount` leading to a lower `final_price`. This is a direct causal relationship from cause to effect without intervention.",
  "causal_map": "is_member → discount; discount → final_price",
  "causal_map_integration": "When is_member is True, it leads to a non-zero discount, which in turn decreases the final_price.",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discount` takes three parameters: `price`, `is_member`, and `discount_rate`.\n\n2. If `is_member` is `True`:\n   - A discount is calculated as `price * discount_rate`.\n   - This discount is then subtracted from `price` to get the `final_price`.\n\n3. If `is_member` is `False`:\n   - No discount is applied (discount remains `0`).\n   - The `final_price` is simply the original `price`.\n\n4. The question specifically asks about the scenario where `is_member` is `True`.\n\n5. When `is_member` is `True`, the discount is applied, which means the `final_price` will be lower than the original `price` because we subtract the discount from it.\n\n6.

The question specifically asks what happens when `is_member` is `True`.\n\n5. When `is_member` is `True`, we calculate a discount which is then subtracted from the original `price`. This subtraction operation will always result in a lower value for `final_price` compared to the original `price`.\n\n6.
