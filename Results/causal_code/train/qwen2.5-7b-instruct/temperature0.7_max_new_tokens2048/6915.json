    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Car` class has two attributes:\n   - `engine_status`: A boolean indicating whether the engine is running.\n   - `fuel_level`: An integer representing the current fuel level.\n\n2. The `start_engine` method sets `engine_status` to `True` only if there is fuel available (`fuel_level > 0`).\n\n3. The `drive` method checks if the engine is running (`self.engine_status`) before deducting fuel from the fuel level. If driving causes the fuel level to drop to 0 or below, it sets `engine_status` to `False`.\n\n4. From these points, we can see that:\n   - If the engine is started (`engine_status` is `True`), the fuel level will be reduced over time as the car drives.\n   - If the fuel level drops to 0 while driving, the engine will stop (`engine_status` becomes `False`).\n   - If the fuel level is 0 and the engine is not running (`engine_status` is `False`), this could be due to either the engine never being started (because there was no fuel) or the engine stopping because of running out of fuel during driving.\n\n5. However, if the engine is not running (`engine_status` is `False`), we cannot definitively say that the fuel level is 0. The fuel level could be any value up to 100, but the engine would not be able to use any fuel.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that having a fuel level of 0 is a sufficient condition for the engine to not be running, but it is not a necessary condition. Therefore, we can deduce that if the engine is not running, the fuel level could be 0, but it does not necessarily have to be 0.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `Car` class has two attributes: `engine_status` and `fuel_level`.\n2. When the car is initialized, both `engine_status` and `fuel_level` can be set to default values (False for engine_status and 100 for fuel_level).\n3. The `start_engine` method checks if the fuel level is greater than 0 before setting `engine_status` to True.\n4. The `drive` method checks if `engine_status` is True before deducting fuel.\n5. There is no method provided that directly sets `engine_status` to False when the fuel level reaches 0.\n\nBased on this information, let's consider the possible states:\n- If the car starts with a non-zero fuel level and drives until the fuel runs out, the engine will stop due to the `drive` method reducing the fuel level to 0. However, the `engine_status` is only updated after the fuel level drops to 0.\n- If the car is started with a zero fuel level, `start_engine` won't change `engine_status` because the condition `if self.fuel_level > 0:` fails.\n- There is no explicit mechanism in the provided code to turn off the engine when the fuel level hits 0.\n\nGiven these points, we cannot definitively deduce that the engine is not running just because the fuel level is at 0. The engine could have been running up until the fuel was depleted, but the status would only be updated after the fuel level hits 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The `start_engine` method sets `engine_status` to `True` only if the `fuel_level` is greater than 0.\n4. The `drive` method checks if `engine_status` is `True` before decrementing the `fuel_level`. If driving causes the `fuel_level` to drop to 0 or below, it sets `engine_status` to `False`.\n\nGiven these points, let's consider the fuel level being at 0:\n\n- If the `fuel_level` is 0, the `start_engine` method will not be able to set `engine_status` to `True` because the condition `if self.fuel_level > 0:` would fail.\n- Once the engine is started (`engine_status` is `True`), the `drive` method can potentially deplete the `fuel_level` to 0, which would then stop the engine (`engine_status` becomes `False`).\n\nTherefore, if the `fuel_level` is 0, we can deduce that the engine is not running unless it was just turned off due to running out of fuel during a drive.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
