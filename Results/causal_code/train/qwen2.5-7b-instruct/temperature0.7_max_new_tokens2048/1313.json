    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. Initially, `health_sys` is created with 10 doctors and 100 patients.\n2. The `schedule_appointments` method is called, which sets the number of appointments to `num_patients // num_doctors`, i.e., 100 // 10 = 10.\n3. Then, `increase_doctors(2)` is called, which adds 2 more doctors to the system, making the total number of doctors 12.\n4. After increasing the number of doctors, the `schedule_appointments` method is called again, setting the number of appointments to `num_patients // num_doctors`, i.e., 100 // 12 ≈ 8 (assuming integer division).\n\nSo, the total number of appointments does change when the number of doctors is increased.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `num_doctors` = 10\n   - `num_patients` = 100\n   - `appointments` = 0 (since it's initialized to 0)\n\n2. **First Method Call**:\n   - `schedule_appointments()` is called.\n   - Since `num_doctors > 0`, the number of appointments is calculated as `num_patients // num_doctors`.\n   - This results in `appointments = 100 // 10 = 10`.\n\n3. **Increase Doctors**:\n   - `increase_doctors(2)` is called.\n   - `num_doctors` becomes `10 + 2 = 12`.\n   - The method `schedule_appointments()` is called again.\n   - New number of appointments is `num_patients // num_doctors = 100 // 12 = 8`.\n\n4. **Emergency Situation**:\n   - `emergency(5)` is called.\n   - Since `num_emergencies (5) > num_doctors (12)`, this condition does not trigger (it would only add patients if emergencies exceed doctors).\n   - Therefore, no changes to `num_patients` or `appointments`.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that when the number of doctors is increased from 10 to 12, the number of appointments changes from 10 to 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - `health_sys` is initialized with 10 doctors and 100 patients.\n   - The `schedule_appointments` method is called, which sets `appointments` to `num_patients // num_doctors`, resulting in 10 appointments (100 // 10).\n\n2. **Increase Doctors**:\n   - `increase_doctors(2)` is called, increasing the number of doctors from 10 to 12.\n   - The `schedule_appointments` method is then called again.\n   - With 12 doctors, the new number of appointments is calculated as `100 // 12`, which results in approximately 8 appointments.\n\n3. **Emergency Intervention**:\n   - `emergency(5)` is called, which means 5 emergencies occur.\n   - Since there are only 12 doctors, the excess emergencies (5 - 12) do not affect the number of patients since there are enough doctors to handle the emergencies.\n   - However, this does not change the number of appointments because the number of doctors remains the same at 12.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - When the number of doctors changes (either by increasing or decreasing), the `schedule_appointments` method recalculates the number of appointments based on the current number of doctors and patients.\n   - Therefore, if the number of doctors increases, the total number of appointments will indeed change.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `HealthSystem` class has methods to manage the number of doctors, patients, and appointments.\n\n2. The `schedule_appointments` method calculates the number of appointments based on the current number of doctors and patients:\n   ```python\n   self.appointments = self.num_patients // self.num_doctors\n   ```\n\n3. The `increase_doctors` method increases the number of doctors and then calls `schedule_appointments` to recalculate the number of appointments:\n   ```python\n   self.num_doctors += new_doctors\n   self.schedule_appointments()\n   ```\n\n4. When we call `health_sys.increase_doctors(2)`, it does two things:\n   - Increases the number of doctors from 10 to 12.\n   - Recalculates the number of appointments using the updated number of doctors.\n\n5. Since the number of patients remains constant (100), increasing the number of doctors will result in more appointments being scheduled.\n\n6. Therefore, increasing the number of doctors will indeed change the total number of appointments.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `num_doctors` is initially set to 10.\n   - `num_patients` is initially set to 100.\n\n2. **First Method Call**:\n   - `schedule_appointments()` is called.\n   - The calculation `self.appointments = self.num_patients // self.num_doctors` results in `100 // 10 = 10` appointments.\n\n3. **Increasing Doctors**:\n   - `increase_doctors(2)` is called, increasing `num_doctors` from 10 to 12.\n   - This method calls `schedule_appointments()` again.\n   - Now, `self.appointments = 100 // 12`, which equals approximately 8 (since we're using integer division).\n\n4. **Emergency Situation**:\n   - `emergency(5)` is called, where `num_emergencies` (5) is greater than `num_doctors` (12).\n   - However, since `num_emergencies` is less than `num_doctors`, no patients are added to the queue for this scenario.\n\nFrom these steps, we can see that increasing the number of doctors does indeed change the total number of appointments scheduled. Initially, there were 10 appointments, but after increasing the number of doctors to 12, the number of appointments decreased to approximately 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
