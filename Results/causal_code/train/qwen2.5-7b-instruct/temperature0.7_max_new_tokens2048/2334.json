    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a `WeatherSimulator` class that determines the weather condition based on the temperature.\n2. The `determineWeather` method returns:\n   - 'Snow' for temperatures below 0\n   - 'Cold' for temperatures between 0 and 20 (exclusive)\n   - 'Mild' for temperatures between 20 and 30 (exclusive)\n   - 'Hot' for temperatures 30 or above\n\n3. Given that the initial temperature is 15, the weather condition is 'Cold'.\n\n4. To change the weather condition from 'Cold' to 'Hot', we need to raise the temperature to at least 30 because:\n   - 'Hot' corresponds to temperatures of 30 or above\n   - Any temperature below 30 will result in a weather condition other than 'Hot'\n\n5.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with a `WeatherSimulator` object initialized with a temperature of 15, which results in the weather condition being 'Cold'.\n\n2.
