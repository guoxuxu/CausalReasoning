    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `OfficeUser` class has an attribute `coffee_access` which is initially set to `False`.\n\n2. **Project Assignment**: When a user is assigned to a project using the `assign_project` method, the `update_coffee_access` method is called.\n\n3. **Coffee Access Logic**:\n   - If the active project is either 'Project X' or 'Project Z', `coffee_access` is set to `True`.\n   - For any other project, `coffee_access` remains `False`.\n\n4. **Revoking Coffee Access**: The question states that a user's coffee access has been revoked. This means `coffee_access` is now `False`.\n\n5. **Deduction**: Since `coffee_access` is only set to `True` for projects 'Project X' or 'Project Z', if it is now `False`, it implies that the user was not on one of these projects when their access was revoked.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we can infer that the user's project assignment must have changed to a project other than 'Project X' or 'Project Z'.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The method `update_coffee_access` sets `coffee_access` to `True` only if the current `active_project` is either 'Project X' or 'Project Z'.\n\n4. If a user's coffee access is revoked (set to `False`), we need to determine if this means their project assignment must have changed to a project other than 'Project X' or 'Project Z'.\n\n5. According to the given causal relationship:\n   - `OfficeUser.active_project → OfficeUser.coffee_access`\n   - `OfficeUser.active_project ← 'Project X' ∨ 'Project Z'`\n\n6.

Therefore, if `coffee_access` is `False`, it implies that the `active_project` cannot be 'Project X' or 'Project Z'.\n\n8. Since the only projects that grant coffee access are 'Project X' and 'Project Z', revoking coffee access indicates that the user must have been reassigned to a different project.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that if a user had their coffee access revoked, it can indeed be inferred that their project assignment has changed to a project other than 'Project X' or 'Project Z'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
