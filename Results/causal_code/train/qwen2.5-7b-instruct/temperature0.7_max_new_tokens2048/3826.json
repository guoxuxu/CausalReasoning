    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes two parameters: `data` (a list of numbers) and `condition`.\n\n2. If `condition` is set to 'A':\n   - The result is calculated as `sum(data) + 10`.\n   \n3. We need to compare this result with just the sum of the data (`sum(data)`).\n\n4. To determine if the result is always greater:\n   - We need to see if `sum(data) + 10` is always greater than `sum(data)`.\n\n5. Mathematically, adding 10 to any number will always make it greater than the original number.\n   - For example, if `sum(data)` is 5, then `sum(data) + 10` would be 15, which is indeed greater.\n   - This holds true for any value of `sum(data)`.\n\n6. Therefore, `sum(data) + 10` will always be greater than `sum(data)` regardless of what the actual values in `data` are.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

For any other value of `condition`, the function doubles the sum of `data`.\n\n5. We need to determine if the result will always be greater than the sum of `data` when `condition` is 'A'.\n\n6. When `condition` is 'A', the result is calculated as `sum(data) + 10`.\n\n7.
