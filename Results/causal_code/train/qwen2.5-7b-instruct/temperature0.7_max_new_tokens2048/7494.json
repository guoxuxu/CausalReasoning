  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The only condition under which the status is set to 'too_hot' is if the temperature exceeds 30, according to the provided code. Therefore, if the status is 'too_hot', it implies that temperature was above 30.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` checks if 'temperature' is in the input data.\n2. If 'temperature' is present, it assigns the value to the variable `temperature`.\n3. It then checks if `temperature` is greater than 30.\n4. If `temperature` is indeed greater than 30, it sets `data['status']` to 'too_hot'.\n5. If `temperature` is not greater than 30, it sets `data['status']` to 'normal'.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that if `data['status']` is set to 'too_hot', it means that the condition `temperature > 30` was true when the function executed.\n\nTherefore, if the status is 'too_hot', we can conclude that the temperature was definitely higher than 30.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

For the status to be set to 'too_hot', the condition `temperature > 30` must have evaluated to True.\n5. This means that if the status is 'too_hot', the temperature must indeed be higher than 30.\n\nTherefore, based on the logic within the function, if the status is 'too_hot', we can conclude that the temperature was definitely higher than 30.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
