    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - The `temperature` starts at 20 degrees Celsius.\n   - `isRaining` starts as `false`, meaning it's initially sunny.\n\n2. **Update Logic**:\n   - The `updateWeather` method checks if the current `day` is divisible by 7 using `day % 7 == 0`.\n   - If the condition is true, it toggles the value of `isRaining` (i.e., `isRaining = !isRaining`).\n\n3. **Behavior on Day Divisible by 7**:\n   - When `day % 7 == 0`, the `isRaining` state is flipped.\n   - Initially, `isRaining` is `false`, so on the first day divisible by 7 (e.g., day 7), it will become `true`, indicating it will rain.\n\n4. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if the weather transitions from sunny to rainy when the day number is divisible by 7, assuming it was sunny the previous day.\n   - Since `isRaining` is initially `false` (sunny), and on the next day divisible by 7 it becomes `true` (rainy), this confirms the transition from sunny to rainy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The `isRaining` flag is initialized to `false`, meaning it starts as sunny.\n\n2. **Update Logic**:\n   - If the current day (`day`) is divisible by 7 (`day % 7 == 0`), the `isRaining` flag toggles between `true` and `false`.\n   - If it's raining (`isRaining == true`), the temperature decreases by 2 degrees.\n   - If it's not raining (`isRaining == false`), the temperature increases by 1 degree.\n\n3. **Specific Case Analysis**:\n   - On the first day (day 1), it is sunny (`isRaining == false`).\n   - On the second day (day 2), the weather does not change because `day % 7 != 0`.\n   - This pattern continues until the 7th day (day 7), where `day % 7 == 0`, causing the weather to toggle.\n   - On the 7th day, since it started sunny on day 1, it will now be raining after toggling.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the day number is divisible by 7, the weather will indeed transition from sunny to rainy, assuming it was sunny the previous day.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The code snippet initializes `temperature` to 20 degrees Celsius and `isRaining` to `false` (sunny).\n\n2. **Day Transition Logic**:\n   - If `day % 7 == 0`, the weather will transition: `isRaining` will flip from `true` to `false` or `false` to `true`.\n   - If it is raining (`isRaining == true`), the temperature decreases by 2 degrees.\n   - If it is not raining (`isRaining == false`), the temperature increases by 1 degree.\n\n3. **Assumption**: We assume it was sunny (not raining) on the previous day. This means `isRaining` is `false`.\n\n4. **Checking Day Divisibility by 7**:\n   - When the day number is divisible by 7, the `updateWeather` method is called.\n   - Since `isRaining` is currently `false` (sunny), the condition `if (isRaining)` will be false.\n   - Therefore, the temperature will increase by 1 degree, making the new temperature 21 degrees Celsius.\n   - The `isRaining` state will then flip to `true` because of the line `isRaining = !isRaining;`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: If the day number is divisible by 7, the weather will indeed transition from sunny (not raining) to rainy.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The `isRaining` variable is initialized to `false`, meaning it starts as sunny.\n\n2. **Update Weather Logic**:\n   - If the current day (`day`) is divisible by 7, the value of `isRaining` toggles between `true` and `false`.\n   - On days that are not multiples of 7, the weather does not change.\n\n3. **Specific Day Check**:\n   - We need to check what happens on a specific day where `day % 7 == 0` (i.e., it's a multiple of 7).\n   - On such days, `isRaining` toggles its value.\n   - If it was sunny (not raining) the previous day, then on the next day (which is a multiple of 7), it will become rainy.\n\n4. **Given Scenario**:\n   - The problem asks about the transition from sunny to rainy on the next day when the day number is divisible by 7.\n   - If it was sunny (not raining) the previous day, then on the next day (a multiple of 7), it will indeed become rainy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `updateWeather` method and the `willItRainTomorrow` method:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - The `temperature` starts at 20°C.\n   - `isRaining` starts as `false`, meaning it's sunny.\n\n2. **updateWeather Method**:\n   - If the current `day` is divisible by 7 (`day % 7 == 0`), the value of `isRaining` toggles (i.e., it changes from `true` to `false` or from `false` to `true`).\n   - If `isRaining` is `true`, the temperature decreases by 2 degrees.\n   - If `isRaining` is `false`, the temperature increases by 1 degree.\n\n3. **willItRainTomorrow Method**:\n   - This method checks if the next day (i.e., `day + 1`) will be rainy based on the current day.\n   - It returns `!isRaining` if the next day (`day + 1`) is a multiple of 7, and `isRaining` otherwise.\n\nNow, let's analyze the scenario where the day number is divisible by 7 and it was sunny the previous day:\n\n- On a day that is not a multiple of 7, it is sunny (`isRaining == false`).\n- When the day becomes a multiple of 7 (e.g., 7, 14, 21, etc.), the `isRaining` state toggles.\n- Therefore, if it was sunny the previous day (not a multiple of 7), the next day (a multiple of 7) will make it rainy (`isRaining` becomes `true`).\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
