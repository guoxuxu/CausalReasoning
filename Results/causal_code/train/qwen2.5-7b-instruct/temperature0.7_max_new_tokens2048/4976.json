    "To determine whether increasing `predicted_sales` can imply that both `ad_spend` and `growth` have increased, let's analyze the given causal relationships and the function step-by-step.\n\n1. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `ad_expenditure` affects `sales_multipler`.\n   - `economic_growth` affects `sales_multipler`.\n   - `ad_expenditure` affects `predicted_sales` through `sales_multipler`.\n   - `sales_multipler` directly affects `predicted_sales`.\n\n2. **Function Analysis**:\n   - If `ad_spend > 50000` and `economic_growth >= 2.0`, then `sales_multipler = 2.5`.\n   - If `ad_spend > 50000` and `economic_growth < 2.0`, then `sales_multipler = 2.0`.\n   - If `ad_spend <= 50000` and `economic_growth >= 2.0`, then `sales_multipler = 1.5`.\n   - If `ad_spend <= 50000` and `economic_growth < 2.0`, then `sales_multipler = 1.0`.\n\n3. **Given Values**:\n   - `ad_spend = 60000` (which is greater than 50000).\n   - `growth = 1.5` (which is less than 2.0).\n\n4. **Predicted Sales Calculation**:\n   - Since `ad_spend > 50000` and `growth < 2.0`, the `sales_multipler` will be 2.0.\n   - The base sales volume is 500.\n   - Therefore, `predicted_sales = 500 * 2.0 = 1000`.\n\n5. **Implication of Increasing `predicted_sales`**:\n   - For `predicted_sales` to increase, the `sales_multipler` must increase.\n   - The only way for `sales_multipler` to increase from 2.0 is if `ad_spend` increases beyond 50000 and `growth` increases to 2.0 or more.\n\nBased on the above analysis, increasing `predicted_sales` does not necessarily imply that both `ad_spend` and `growth` have increased.
