    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The ShoppingCart class has two methods for modifying the total cost:\n   - `add_item`: This method increases the total cost when an item is added.\n   - `remove_item`: This method decreases the total cost when an item is removed.\n\n2. The question asks if an increase in total_cost necessarily means that an item was added.\n\n3. From the given code, we can see that the only way to increase the total_cost is by adding an item using the `add_item` method.\n\n4. However, there could be other ways to increase the total_cost that are not mentioned in the provided code:\n   - External factors not controlled by this class could change the total_cost.\n   - Another method (not shown in the provided code) could be implemented that increases the total_cost without adding an item.\n\n5. Since we don't have complete information about all possible methods of modifying the total_cost, we cannot say with certainty that an increase in total_cost always means an item was added.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The ShoppingCart class has methods to add and remove items.\n2. When an item is added using `add_item`, the total cost increases by the price of that item.\n3. However, there are other ways the total cost can increase:\n   - If the price of an item is manually adjusted elsewhere in the code (not shown here).\n   - If a discount is applied and then removed, the total cost might increase again.\n4. The method `apply_discount` reduces the total cost, so applying a discount and then removing it would increase the total cost.\n5. Therefore, an increase in `total_cost` does not necessarily mean that an item was added; it could be due to other operations as well.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
