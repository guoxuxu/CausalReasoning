    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `updateSystemStatistics` method is responsible for updating the sales and visits based on the number of new visits.\n\n2. If `promotionActive` is `true`, then each new visit results in 2 units of sales being added to the total sales.\n\n3. If `promotionActive` is `false`, then each new visit results in 1 unit of sales being added to the total sales.\n\n4. Activating the promotion sets `promotionActive` to `true`.\n\n5. When `promotionActive` is `true`, the system multiplies the number of new visits by 2 before adding it to the sales.\n\n6. Therefore, when the promotion is active, each new visit contributes more to the sales (2 units) compared to when it is not active (1 unit).\n\n7. Since the number of new visits is always positive (assuming the method is called with a positive value), and the multiplier is greater when the promotion is active, the sales will indeed increase more rapidly when the promotion is active.\n\n8. However, the question asks if the promotion \"inevitably\" leads to an increase in sales. Inevitability implies that it will happen without any exceptions.\n\n9. There could be scenarios where despite having the promotion active, the number of new visits might be very low or zero, which would still result in no change in sales.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that while the promotion generally increases sales, it does not necessarily mean that sales will always increase just because the promotion is activated. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the `updateSystemStatistics` method**:\n   - This method updates the sales based on the number of new visits.\n   - If the promotion is active (`promotionActive` is true), each new visit results in 2 additional sales.\n   - If the promotion is not active, each new visit results in 1 additional sale.\n\n2. **Effect of activating the promotion**:\n   - When `activatePromotion()` is called, `promotionActive` changes from false to true.\n   - In the next call to `updateSystemStatistics`, if there are new visits, each visit will now result in 2 sales instead of 1 because `promotionActive` is now true.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Activating the promotion changes the multiplier for sales from 1 to 2 for any new visits that occur after the promotion is activated.\n   - Therefore, unless there are no new visits after the promotion is activated, the sales will indeed increase due to the higher multiplier.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the `updateSystemStatistics` method**:\n   - This method updates the `sales` and `visits` based on the `newVisits` parameter.\n   - If `promotionActive` is `true`, each visit contributes twice to the sales (`newVisits * 2`).\n   - If `promotionActive` is `false`, each visit contributes once to the sales (`newVisits`).\n\n2. **Effect of Activating Promotion**:\n   - When `promotionActive` is set to `true`, the system will treat each visit as contributing twice to the sales.\n   - This means that for every visit, the sales will be doubled compared to when the promotion is not active.\n\n3. **Does Activation Always Increase Sales?**:\n   - The activation of the promotion changes the multiplier from 1 to 2 for each visit.\n   - Since multiplying any positive number by 2 results in a larger number, this change will always result in an increase in sales, assuming there are at least one visit.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If no visits occur, then sales would remain unchanged regardless of whether the promotion is active or not.\n   - However, the question does not specify this scenario, so we assume normal operation with visits.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that activating the promotion will indeed lead to an increase in sales, provided there are visits.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `updateSystemStatistics` method is responsible for updating sales based on new visits.\n2. If `promotionActive` is true:\n   - Sales increase by `newVisits * 2`\n3. If `promotionActive` is false:\n   - Sales increase by `newVisits`\n\n4. Activating the promotion sets `promotionActive` to true.\n5. When `promotionActive` is true, the system doubles the number of new visits added to sales.\n\nNow, let's consider if this will always lead to an increase in sales:\n\n- If there are no visits (`newVisits = 0`), then sales will not change regardless of whether the promotion is active or not.\n- For any positive number of visits, doubling the visits (when the promotion is active) will always result in a higher sales figure compared to not having the promotion active.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the scenario where the system might have negative visits (which isn't typical but hypothetically possible). In such a case, even with the promotion active, the sales could still decrease if the multiplier effect (doubling) results in a larger negative value.\n\nGiven that the problem doesn't specify any negative visit scenarios and generally, increasing the number of visits (even if doubled) should lead to an increase in sales, we can conclude that in most practical cases, activating the promotion will indeed lead to an increase in sales.\n\nBut to be absolutely precise and considering all edge cases, the statement \"invariably\" leads us to a cautious conclusion:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**:\n   - The `ECommerceSystem` has two main variables affecting sales: `visits` and `promotionActive`.\n   - When `promotionActive` is true, each visit contributes twice as much to sales compared to when it is false.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Update Logic**:\n   - If `promotionActive` is true, then for every new visit (`newVisits`), the sales increase by `2 * newVisits`.\n   - If `promotionActive` is false, then for every new visit (`newVisits`), the sales increase by `newVisits`.\n\n3. **Considering the Impact of Activating Promotion**:\n   - When the promotion is activated, `promotionActive` changes from false to true.\n   - This change will cause the system to treat each visit as contributing twice as much to sales.\n\n4. **Determining the Outcome**:\n   - If there are any visits after the promotion is activated, the sales will indeed increase because each visit now contributes more to sales.\n   - Even if there are no additional visits, the existing visits will still count towards sales, but their contribution will be doubled due to the promotion being active.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the activation of the promotion directly affects the way visits contribute to sales, and given that visits are a non-negative quantity, the sales will inevitably increase upon activation of the promotion.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the variables involved:**\n   - `promotionActive`: A boolean flag that indicates whether a promotion is active.\n   - `sales`: The number of sales.\n   - `visits`: The number of visits.\n\n2. **Understand the relationship between `promotionActive` and `sales`:**\n   - If `promotionActive` is `true`, then for every visit (`newVisits`), the sales are increased by `2 * newVisits`.\n   - If `promotionActive` is `false`, then for every visit (`newVisits`), the sales are increased by `newVisits`.\n\n3. **Analyze the effect of activating the promotion:**\n   - When `promotionActive` is set to `true`, the sales calculation changes from adding `newVisits` to adding `2 * newVisits`.\n   - This means that for each visit, the sales will now be doubled compared to when the promotion is not active.\n\n4. **Consider the impact on visits:**\n   - The number of visits (`visits`) does not directly change the sales unless there is an additional mechanism affecting it. However, we can infer that if more people visit due to the promotion, the sales would increase even more.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Activating the promotion will always result in an increase in sales because it multiplies the contribution of each visit to the sales figure by 2.
