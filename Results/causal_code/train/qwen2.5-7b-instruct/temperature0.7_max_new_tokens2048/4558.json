    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthStatus` class has a method `query_immune_status()` which returns the current immune response status.\n2. This method checks if 'immune_boost' is in the list of medications (`self.medications`).\n3. If 'immune_boost' is found, it returns 'boosted'.\n4. If 'immune_boost' is not found, it returns the pre-calculated `self.immune_response`.\n5. The `calculate_immune_response()` method sets the initial immune response based on age:\n   - Ages > 60 get 'low'\n   - Ages between 31-60 get 'medium'\n   - Ages <= 30 get 'high'\n6. The `add_medication()` method adds a new medication to the list and specifically checks for 'immune_boost', returning a message if it is added.\n\nNow, let's consider when the immune response status would be 'boosted':\n\n- It can only be 'boosted' if 'immune_boost' is explicitly added as a medication.\n- If no 'immune_boost' is added, the status will reflect the calculated immune response based on age.\n\nTherefore, observing an immune response status of 'boosted' necessarily indicates that 'immune_boost' medication has been administered.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `HealthStatus` class has a method `add_medication` which can add medications to the `medications` list.\n2. If the medication added is 'immune_boost', the method returns a string 'immune response boosted'.\n3. The `query_immune_status` method checks if 'immune_boost' is in the `medications` list.\n4. If 'immune_boost' is found, it returns 'boosted'.\n5. Otherwise, it returns the pre-calculated `immune_response`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where we observe an immune response status of 'boosted':\n\n- For 'boosted' to be returned, 'immune_boost' must be present in the `medications` list.\n- However, the presence of 'immune_boost' in the list does not necessarily mean it was the last medication added.\n\nTherefore, observing an immune response status of 'boosted' does not necessarily indicate that 'immune_boost' medication has been administered at any point, as the check only verifies its current presence, not its history.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthStatus` class has an attribute `immun_response` which is calculated based on the age.\n2. The method `add_medication` appends a new medication to the `medications` list and returns a string if 'immune_boost' is added.\n3. The method `query_immune_status` checks if 'immune_boost' is in the `medications` list and returns 'boosted' if it is present. If not, it returns the previously calculated `immune_response`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where we observe an immune response status of 'boosted':\n\n- For the status to be 'boosted', the condition `if 'immune_boost' in self.medications:` must be true.\n- This means that 'immune_boost' must have been added to the `medications` list.\n\nGiven these points, if we see an immune response status of 'boosted', it necessarily indicates that 'immune_boost' medication has been administered.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

Otherwise, it returns the pre-calculated `immune_response` based on the age.\n\nNow, let's consider what would cause the immune status to be 'boosted':\n\n- The only way to explicitly set the immune status to 'boosted' is by having 'immune_boost' in the `medications` list.\n- However, there's no other way within the provided code to set the immune status to 'boosted' directly; it can only be returned as a result of checking the medications list.\n\nGiven this, we can conclude that observing an immune response status of 'boosted' does indeed necessarily indicate that 'immune_boost' medication has been administered, because there's no other mechanism in the provided code to produce this status.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthStatus` class has a method `query_immune_status()` which returns the current immune response status.\n2. This status can be influenced by two main factors:\n   - The calculated immune response based on the patient's age.\n   - The addition of the 'immune_boost' medication.\n\n3. If 'immune_boost' is added to the medications list, `query_immune_status()` explicitly returns 'boosted'.\n\n4. However, the initial immune response (calculated from age) does not include any reference to 'boosted'. Therefore, an immune response status of 'boosted' can only come from adding the 'immune_boost' medication.\n\n5. There is no other way within the provided code for the immune response status to be 'boosted' except by adding the 'immune_boost' medication.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that an immune response status of 'boosted' necessarily indicates that 'immune_boost' medication has been administered.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
