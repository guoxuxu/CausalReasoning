    "Let's analyze the given function `sales_prediction` step by step to determine if an increase in temperature will lead to an increase in sales without any changes to the promotion status.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Base Sales**: The base sales value is set to 100.\n2. **Temperature Check**:\n   - If the temperature is greater than 20:\n     - If promotion is active, sales = base_sales + 50 (which is 150).\n     - If promotion is not active, sales = base_sales + 20 (which is 120).\n   - If the temperature is 20 or less:\n     - If promotion is active, sales = base_sales + 30 (which is 130).\n     - If promotion is not active, sales = base_sales (which is 100).\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Temperature Increase (greater than 20)**:\n  - Regardless of whether the promotion is active or not, there is an increase in sales compared to the base sales.\n  - With promotion active: 150 vs 100 (increase)\n  - Without promotion: 120 vs 100 (increase)\n\n- **Temperature Decrease (20 or less)**:\n  - With promotion active: 130 vs 100 (increase)\n  - Without promotion: 100 vs 100 (no change)\n\n### Conclusion:\nFor temperatures above 20, increasing the temperature will always result in an increase in sales, regardless of whether a promotion is active or not. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Base Sales**: The base sales are set to 100 regardless of temperature or promotion status.\n\n2. **Temperature Increase (above 20)**:\n   - If there is no promotion, sales increase by 20 (100 + 20).\n   - If there is a promotion, sales increase by 50 (100 + 50).\n\n3. **Temperature Below 20**:\n   - If there is no promotion, sales remain at 100.\n   - If there is a promotion, sales increase by 30 (100 + 30).\n\n4. **Effect of Temperature Increase**:\n   - For both temperature scenarios (above 20 and below 20), the presence of a promotion results in an increase in sales.\n   - Without a promotion, the temperature increase only affects the sales when it is above 20, resulting in an increase of 20 from the base sales.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that if the temperature increases and there is no promotion, sales will indeed increase from the base sales of 100 to 120. However, the question specifically asks if sales will likely increase \"without any promotion changes,\" which implies a scenario where the promotion status remains constant.\n\nSince the function does not change the promotion status based on temperature, the only relevant part for our analysis is the temperature effect directly on sales.\n\nTherefore, with an increase in temperature, sales will likely increase from the base sales (assuming no promotion is active).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_prediction` takes two parameters: `temperature` and `promotion_active`.\n\n2. If the temperature is greater than 20:\n   - And if promotion is active, sales are calculated as `base_sales + 50`.\n   - Otherwise (promotion not active), sales are calculated as `base_sales + 20`.\n\n3. If the temperature is 20 or less:\n   - And if promotion is active, sales are calculated as `base_sales + 30`.\n   - Otherwise (promotion not active), sales remain at `base_sales`.\n\n4. The question asks if an increase in temperature will likely lead to an increase in sales, assuming no change in promotion status.\n\n5. Let's consider both scenarios for promotion status:\n   - **With Promotion Active**:\n     - If temperature > 20, sales = base_sales + 50.\n     - If temperature ≤ 20, sales = base_sales + 30.\n     In both cases, sales increase with higher temperatures.\n   \n   - **Without Promotion**:\n     - If temperature > 20, sales = base_sales + 20.\n     - If temperature ≤ 20, sales = base_sales.\n     In both cases, sales increase with higher temperatures.\n\n6. In both scenarios (promotion active or not), an increase in temperature leads to an increase in sales.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's analyze the function `sales_prediction` step by step to determine if an increase in temperature will lead to an increase in sales, assuming no change in the promotion status.\n\n1. **Base Sales**: The base sales are set to 100 regardless of the temperature or promotion status.\n\n2. **Temperature Condition**:\n   - If `temperature > 20`:\n     - If `promotion_active` is `True`, sales = `base_sales + 50`\n     - If `promotion_active` is `False`, sales = `base_sales + 20`\n   - If `temperature <= 20`:\n     - If `promotion_active` is `True`, sales = `base_sales + 30`\n     - If `promotion_active` is `False`, sales = `base_sales`\n\n3. **Impact of Temperature Increase**:\n   - When `temperature > 20`:\n     - Increasing the temperature from below 20 to above 20 will change the sales formula from potentially `base_sales + 30` (if promotion is active) to either `base_sales + 50` (if promotion is active) or `base_sales + 20` (if promotion is not active). In both cases, sales increase.\n   - When `temperature <= 20`:\n     - Increasing the temperature to above 20 will change the sales formula from `base_sales` (if promotion is not active) or `base_sales + 30` (if promotion is active) to either `base_sales + 50` (if promotion is active) or `base_sales + 20` (if promotion is not active). Again, sales increase in both scenarios.\n\nGiven that in all conditions where the temperature increases, the sales formula results in higher sales (either by adding 20, 30, or 50 to the base sales), we can conclude that an increase in temperature will indeed lead to an increase in sales, provided there are no changes in the promotion status.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_prediction` takes two parameters: `temperature` and `promotion_active`.\n2. The base sales are set to 100.\n3. We need to consider two main conditions for temperature:\n   - If temperature > 20\n   - If temperature <= 20\n\n4. For temperature > 20:\n   - If promotion is active, sales = base_sales + 50 (100 + 50 = 150)\n   - If promotion is not active, sales = base_sales + 20 (100 + 20 = 120)\n\n5. For temperature <= 20:\n   - If promotion is active, sales = base_sales + 30 (100 + 30 = 130)\n   - If promotion is not active, sales = base_sales (100)\n\n6. Now, we need to determine if an increase in temperature alone will lead to an increase in sales without any change in promotion status.\n\n7. Let's compare scenarios:\n   - If temperature was initially <= 20 and increases to > 20:\n     - Without promotion: Sales go from 100 to 120 (increase)\n     - With promotion: Sales go from 100 to 150 (increase)\n   - If temperature was already > 20 and increases further:\n     - Without promotion: Sales stay at 120 (no change)\n     - With promotion: Sales stay at 150 (no change)\n\n8. From the above analysis, we can see that increasing the temperature from <= 20 to > 20 will always result in an increase in sales, regardless of whether there is a promotion or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
