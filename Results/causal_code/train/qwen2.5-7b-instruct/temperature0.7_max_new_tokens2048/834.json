  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 105 explicitly meets the condition in the 'increaseTemp()' method where the temperature exceeding 100 leads to the reaction rate being doubled. As this is a direct condition in the code, intervening to set the temperature to 105 will result in doubling the reaction rate as per the logic defined.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial temperature is set to 105.\n2.

In the `increaseTemp` method:\n   - The temperature is increased by 5.\n   - If the new temperature is greater than 100, the reaction rate is doubled.\n4. When the temperature is set to 105 externally, it immediately triggers the condition `if (temp > 100)` in the `increaseTemp` method.\n5. Since the temperature is already 105, which is greater than 100, the condition is true.\n6.
