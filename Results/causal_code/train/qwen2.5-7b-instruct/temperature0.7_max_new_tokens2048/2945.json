    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `ProductManager` class has methods for adding and removing products.\n2. When a product is added or removed, the `notify_customers` method is called.\n3. `notify_customers` prints a message indicating that a new product has been added or an existing one has been removed.\n4. In the sample usage:\n   - Products start as ['Widget', 'Gadget']\n   - 'Thingamajig' is added\n   - 'Widget' is removed\n5. No mention of 'Sprocket' being added or removed is made in the provided code.\n6. Since there's no notification about 'Sprocket', it suggests that 'Sprocket' was never part of the products list.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can reasonably assume that 'Sprocket' was not in the products initially.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ProductManager` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the `products` list with the provided argument or an empty list if no argument is provided.\n\n2. In the sample usage:\n   - `manager = ProductManager(['Widget', 'Gadget'])`: This initializes the `products` list with ['Widget', 'Gadget'].\n   - `manager.add_product('Thingamajig')`: Adds 'Thingamajig' to the list, making it ['Widget', 'Gadget', 'Thingamajig'].\n   - `manager.remove_product('Widget')`: Removes 'Widget' from the list, resulting in ['Gadget', 'Thingamajig'].\n\n3. There is no mention of 'Sprocket' being added or removed at any point in the provided code.\n\n4. Since 'Sprocket' is not mentioned as part of the initial list or any subsequent operations, it can be concluded that 'Sprocket' was never in the `products` list.\n\n5.

The question asks if we can assume 'Sprocket' was not in the products initially based on the absence of a notification for its removal.\n\nGiven the code and the sample usage:\n- 'Widget' was initially in the list and was removed, which resulted in a notification.\n- 'Thingamajig' was added but not removed, so no notification would be generated for it.\n- No operation was performed on 'Sprocket', and there is no notification for its removal.\n\nSince there is no attempt to remove 'Sprocket' in the provided sample usage, and no notification is generated, we can indeed conclude that 'Sprocket' was not in the initial list of products.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The `add_product` method appends a new product to the `products` list and then calls `notify_customers` with the added product.\n\n4.
