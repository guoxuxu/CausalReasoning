    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_statistics` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It calculates the average (mean) of the data by summing all elements and dividing by the number of elements.\n3.

Divide by the number of elements (5):\n   \\[\n   \\text{variance} = \\frac{70}{5} = 14\n   \\]\n\nSince the data list remains unchanged, the calculations for the average and variance will be exactly the same, leading to the same output.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
