  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "While increasing the discount decreases the unit price, the decrease in unit price might be offset by increased quantity sold due to the more attractive price, leading to stable or even increased total sales. The question assumes a simple negative dependency without considering the potential increase in sales volume.",
  "causal_map": "discount → final_price; final_price → total_sales",

    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_sales` calculates the final price after applying a discount to the base price.\n2. If there is a discount (i.e., `discount > 0`), the final price is reduced from the base price.\n3. The total sales are then calculated by multiplying the final price by the quantity.\n4. The surplus is calculated as 5% of the total sales.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the discount increases:\n\n1. When the discount increases, the final price decreases because it's being multiplied by (1 - discount/100).\n2. A lower final price results in lower total sales when multiplied by the quantity.\n3. Since the total sales are directly proportional to the final price, an increase in the discount will lead to a decrease in total sales.\n\nTherefore, if the discount increases, the total sales will indeed decrease.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - `compute_sales` takes three parameters: `discount`, `quantity`, and `base_price`.\n   - If `discount > 0`, it calculates `final_price` as `base_price * (1 - discount / 100)`.\n   - Otherwise, `final_price` is simply `base_price`.\n\n2. **Total Sales Calculation**:\n   - `total_sales` is calculated as `final_price * quantity`.\n\n3. **Surplus Calculation**:\n   - `surplus` is calculated as `total_sales * 0.05`.\n\n4. **Effect of Discount on Total Sales**:\n   - When `discount > 0`, the `final_price` decreases because it is multiplied by `(1 - discount / 100)`.\n   - A lower `final_price` results in a lower `total_sales` since `total_sales` is `final_price * quantity`.\n\nTherefore, if the discount increases (i.e., becomes a larger negative value or a smaller positive value), the `final_price` will decrease, leading to a decrease in `total_sales`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a function `compute_sales` that takes three parameters: `discount`, `quantity`, and `base_price`.\n\n2. **Discount and Final Price**:\n   - If `discount > 0`, the `final_price` is calculated as `base_price * (1 - discount / 100)`.\n   - If `discount <= 0`, the `final_price` remains `base_price`.\n\n3. **Total Sales Calculation**:\n   - `total_sales` is computed as `final_price * quantity`.\n\n4. **Surplus Calculation**:\n   - `surplus` is calculated as `total_sales * 0.05`.\n\n5. **Effect of Discount on Total Sales**:\n   - The key relationship here is between `discount` and `final_price`, and then between `final_price` and `total_sales`.\n   - When `discount > 0`, the `final_price` decreases because it is reduced by a percentage of the `base_price`.\n   - A lower `final_price` directly results in a lower `total_sales` because `total_sales` is the product of `final_price` and `quantity`.\n\n6. **Given Scenario**:\n   - In the given scenario, we have `discount = 10`, which is greater than 0.\n   - This means the `final_price` will be lower than the `base_price`.\n   - As a result, `total_sales` will also be lower compared to if there were no discount.\n\nTherefore, if the discount increases (i.e., becomes more negative or a larger positive value), the `final_price` will decrease, leading to a decrease in `total_sales`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Discount and Final Price Relationship**:\n   - If `discount > 0`, then `final_price = base_price * (1 - discount / 100)`.\n   - This means that as the discount percentage increases, the `final_price` decreases because the term `(1 - discount / 100)` becomes smaller.\n\n2. **Final Price and Total Sales Relationship**:\n   - The formula for `total_sales` is `total_sales = final_price * quantity`.\n   - Since `final_price` decreases when the discount increases (assuming `quantity` remains constant), `total_sales` will also decrease.\n\n3. **Surplus Calculation**:\n   - The surplus is calculated as `surplus = total_sales * 0.05`.\n   - This does not affect the relationship between the discount and the total sales directly.
