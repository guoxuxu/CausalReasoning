    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have an instance of `SalesData` with initial values:\n   - `totalSales = 0`\n   - `discountThreshold = 100`\n   - `discountApplied = false`\n\n2. The `updateSales` method is called with a positive amount.\n3. Inside `updateSales`, it checks if the passed `amount` is greater than 0. If true, it proceeds.\n4. It then adds the passed `amount` to `totalSales`.\n5. After updating `totalSales`, it checks if `totalSales` is greater than `discountThreshold`.\n6. If the condition in step 5 is met, it calls the `applyDiscount` method.\n\nGiven these steps, we need to determine if `discountApplied` will be set to `true` when `updateSales` is called with a positive amount that causes `totalSales` to exceed `discountThreshold`.\n\n- When `updateSales` is called with a positive amount, `totalSales` increases.\n- If the increase makes `totalSales` greater than `discountThreshold`, the method will call `applyDiscount`.\n- The `applyDiscount` method sets `discountApplied` to `true`.\n\nTherefore, if the conditions are met, `discountApplied` will indeed be set to `true`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The `applyDiscount` method sets `discountApplied` to `true`.\n\nGiven this logic, if a positive `amount` is passed to `updateSales` and it causes `totalSales` to exceed `discountThreshold`, then the `applyDiscount` method will indeed be called, setting `discountApplied` to `true`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
