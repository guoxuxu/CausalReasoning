    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `PriceCalculator` class has a member variable `base_price` which holds the initial price.\n2. There's also a `tax_rate` which determines how much tax is applied to the base price.\n3. The `finalPrice()` method calculates the final price as `base_price * (1 + tax_rate)`.\n4. The `applyDiscount()` method modifies the `base_price` by multiplying it with `(1 - discount)`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if `applyDiscount()` is never called:\n\n5. If `applyDiscount()` is not called, then `base_price` remains unchanged from its initial value set during construction.\n6. Therefore, when `finalPrice()` is called, it will always use the original `base_price` value that was set when the `PriceCalculator` object was created.\n7. Since the `tax_rate` and the formula for calculating `finalPrice()` do not depend on any changes to `base_price` after construction, the `finalPrice()` will always reflect the original price plus tax.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if `applyDiscount()` is never called, the final price will indeed stay the same.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `PriceCalculator` class has two main methods:\n   - `finalPrice()`: This calculates the final price based on the base price and tax rate.\n   - `applyDiscount(double discount)`: This method adjusts the base price by applying a discount.\n\n2. The `finalPrice()` method returns the base price multiplied by `(1 + tax_rate)`.\n\n3. The `applyDiscount()` method modifies the base price by multiplying it with `(1 - discount)`.\n\n4. The question asks if the final price will stay the same if `applyDiscount` is never called.\n\n5. If `applyDiscount` is never called, the base price remains unchanged at its initial value.\n\n6. Therefore, when `finalPrice()` is called, it will use the original base price to calculate the final price, which includes the tax but does not include any discount.\n\n7. Since the base price is not altered by any discount, the final price calculated by `finalPrice()` will be consistent and unchanged regardless of whether `applyDiscount` was ever called or not.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
