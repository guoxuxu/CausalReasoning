    "Let's break down the logic of the `recordSteps` method in the `HealthApp` class:\n\n1. The `recordSteps` method takes an integer `count` as input.\n2. It adds this `count` to the current value of `steps`.\n3. If after adding `count` to `steps`, the total number of steps (`steps`) is greater than 10,000, it sets the `active` variable to `true`.\n\nGiven this information, we can reason that if the steps collected exceed 10,000, the `active` status will indeed be set to `true`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthApp` class has an instance variable `active`, which is initially set to `false`.\n\n2.
