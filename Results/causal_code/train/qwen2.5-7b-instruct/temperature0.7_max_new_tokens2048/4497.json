    "Let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - Initial temperature: 10 degrees.\n   - `isRaining` is initially false.\n\n2. **Executing `setRaining(true)`**:\n   - This changes `isRaining` to true.\n   - According to the method `setRaining`, when it starts raining (`isRaining` becomes true), the temperature drops by 2 degrees.\n\n3. **Temperature Change**:\n   - Initial temperature: 10 degrees.\n   - Temperature after setting raining to true: 10 - 2 = 8 degrees.\n\n4. **Checking for Rain Condition**:\n   - The condition to start raining is when the temperature is less than 15 degrees.\n   - Since the new temperature is 8 degrees, which is less than 15, the condition for rain is met.\n   - Therefore, `isRaining` becomes true again, causing another 2-degree drop in temperature.\n\n5. **Final Temperature Calculation**:\n   - Temperature after the first change: 8 degrees.\n   - Temperature after the second change (due to rain condition): 8 - 2 = 6 degrees.\n\nGiven that the final temperature after both changes is 6 degrees, which is indeed below 8 degrees, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - Initial temperature = 10 degrees.\n   - `isRaining` is initially false.\n\n2. **Effect of `setRaining(true)`**:\n   - This method sets `isRaining` to true.\n   - Since `isRaining` is now true, the temperature will drop by 2 degrees due to the rain.\n\n3. **Temperature Calculation**:\n   - New temperature after setting `isRaining` to true: \\(10 - 2 = 8\\) degrees.\n\n4. **Check for Rain Induced Temperature Drop**:\n   - The condition for rain-induced temperature drop is `if (temperature < 15) { isRaining = true; }`.\n   - Since the new temperature is 8 degrees, which is less than 15, the temperature will drop further by 2 degrees.\n\n5. **Final Temperature Calculation**:\n   - Final temperature after the rain-induced drop: \\(8 - 2 = 6\\) degrees.\n\nTherefore, after executing `setRaining(true)`, the temperature will fall to 6 degrees, which is below 8 degrees.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Initial conditions:\n   - Initial temperature = 10 degrees\n   - isRaining = false\n\n2. When `setRaining(true)` is called:\n   - `isRaining` is set to true\n   - The temperature decreases by 2 degrees due to the rain starting\n\n3. Temperature after setting rain to true:\n   - New temperature = 10 - 2 = 8 degrees\n\n4. Conditions for further temperature changes:\n   - The only condition that could lower the temperature further is if the temperature falls below 15 degrees, which would trigger `isRaining` to remain true.\n   - However, once the temperature is set to 8 degrees, it cannot fall below this value without an external change.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - With the initial temperature of 10 degrees, setting rain to true will bring the temperature down to 8 degrees.\n   - There are no conditions within the code that would allow the temperature to fall below 8 degrees from this point onwards.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
