    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculateProduct` takes two integers and returns their product.\n2. In the `main` function:\n   - `x` is initially set to 5.\n   - `y` is initially set to 10.\n   - `z` is assigned the result of `calculateProduct(x, y)`, which is `5 * 10 = 50`.\n   - `w` is then assigned `z + 10`, which is `50 + 10 = 60`.\n\n3. If we increase the value of `x`, let's say to 6:\n   - `z` would now be `calculateProduct(6, 10)`, which is `60`.\n   - `w` would then be `60 + 10`, which is `70`.\n\n4. Comparing the initial and modified values:\n   - Initially, `w` was 60.\n   - When `x` is increased, `w` becomes 70.\n\nSince increasing `x` results in an increase in `w`, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
