    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `updateHeartRate` method is called with a new heart rate value.\n2. If the `isSleeping` flag is true and the new heart rate is less than 50:\n   - The method sets the `heartRate` to 50.\n3. If the `isSleeping` flag is false or the new heart rate is 50 or more:\n   - The method sets the `heartRate` to the new value.\n\nGiven these steps, we need to focus on the condition where the heart rate provided is less than 50 and the user is sleeping.\n\n4. In this specific scenario:\n   - The `isSleeping` flag is true.\n   - The new heart rate is less than 50.\n\nAccording to the method logic, when both conditions are met, the `heartRate` is explicitly set to 50.\n\nTherefore, under the specified conditions, the stored heart rate will indeed always be 50.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
