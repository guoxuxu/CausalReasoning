    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TemperatureController` class has an attribute `desired_temp` which is set during initialization.\n2. The `adjust_temp` method checks the `ambient_temp` against the `desired_temp`:\n   - If `ambient_temp` is less than `desired_temp - 5`, it calls `heating_on()`.\n   - If `ambient_temp` is greater than `desired_temp + 5`, it calls `cooling_on()`.\n   - Otherwise, it calls `system_off()`.\n\n3. We need to check if setting `desired_temp` to 80 and having `ambient_temp` at 85 would trigger `cooling_on`.\n\n4. With `desired_temp` set to 80:\n   - `desired_temp - 5` would be 75.\n   - `desired_temp + 5` would be 85.\n\n5. Given `ambient_temp` is 85:\n   - This is equal to `desired_temp + 5`, not greater than it.\n   - Therefore, the condition for `cooling_on()` (ambient_temp > desired_temp + 5) is not met.\n\n6. Since the condition for `cooling_on()` is not met, the method will instead call `system_off()`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `TemperatureController` class is initialized with a `desired_temp` of 80.\n2. **Condition Check**: The `adjust_temp` method checks the `ambient_temp` against the `desired_temp` (which is 80).\n3. **Cooling Condition**: The method will call `cooling_on()` if the `ambient_temp` is greater than the `desired_temp + 5`.\n\nGiven:\n- `desired_temp` = 80\n- `ambient_temp` = 85\n\nNow, let's check the condition:\n- `desired_temp + 5` = 80 + 5 = 85\n\nSince `ambient_temp` (85) is exactly equal to `desired_temp + 5`, it does not satisfy the condition for `cooling_on()` to be called.
