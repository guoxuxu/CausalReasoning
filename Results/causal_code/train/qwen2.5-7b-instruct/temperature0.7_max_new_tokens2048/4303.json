    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - `is_green` is initialized to `False`.\n   - `is_red` is initialized to `True`.\n\n2. **Operator Action**:\n   - The operator calls `switch_to_green()`. This method sets `is_green` to `True` and `is_red` to `False`.\n\n3. **Traffic Addition Condition**:\n   - The `add_traffic(increased_traffic)` method checks two conditions:\n     - `increased_traffic` must be `True`.\n     - `is_green` must be `True`.\n\n4. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - If the operator manually overrides to `switch_to_green`, `is_green` becomes `True`.\n   - For the `add_traffic` method to change `is_green` to `False`, both conditions must be met:\n     - `increased_traffic` must be `True`.\n     - `is_green` must be `True`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the operator manually overrides to `switch_to_green`, `is_green` is set to `True`.\n   - The `add_traffic` method will only change `is_green` to `False` if `increased_traffic` is also `True`.\n\nSince the question does not specify that `increased_traffic` is `True`, we cannot assume it is always `True`. Therefore, the addition of traffic will not necessarily change `is_green` to `False` after the operator manually overrides to `switch_to_green`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `TrafficLightController` class has two boolean attributes: `is_green` and `is_red`.\n\n2. Initially, when the controller is instantiated:\n   - `is_green` is set to False\n   - `is_red` is set to True\n\n3. If an operator manually calls `switch_to_green()`:\n   - This method sets `is_green` to True\n   - It also sets `is_red` to False\n\n4. Now, let's consider what happens with the `add_traffic(increased_traffic)` method:\n   - This method checks if `increased_traffic` is True AND `is_green` is True.\n   - If both conditions are met, it calls `switch_to_red()`.\n\n5. When `switch_to_red()` is called:\n   - It sets `is_green` to False\n   - It sets `is_red` to True\n\n6. The question asks specifically about the scenario where an operator manually overrides to `switch_to_green()`. In this case:\n   - `is_green` would be True (as a result of calling `switch_to_green()`).\n   - `is_red` would be False.\n\n7. If `add_traffic(True)` is then called, the condition `if increased_traffic and self.is_green:` would evaluate to True.\n   - As a result, `switch_to_red()` would be called, setting `is_green` to False.\n\nTherefore, the addition of traffic (with `increased_traffic` being True) will indeed change `is_green` to False after an operator manually overrides to `switch_to_green()`.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

For `add_traffic()` to change `is_green` to `False`, `increased_traffic` must be `True` and `is_green` must still be `True` when `add_traffic()` is called.
