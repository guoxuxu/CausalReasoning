  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Although the `base_price` increase raises the `final_price`, the effect is modified by `apply_discount`, which recalculates the `final_price` by subtracting a discount calculated as a percentage of the increased `base_price`. Thus, the overall `final_price` may not necessarily increase proportionally depending on the discount percentage.",

    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Initially, when the `ProductManager` is instantiated, both `base_price` and `final_price` are set to the provided value.\n\n2. When we call `apply_discount`, it calculates the discount based on the current `base_price` and subtracts it from `base_price` to get `final_price`.\n\n3. If we then call `update_base_price` with a new higher price:\n   - The `base_price` is updated to the new higher value.\n   - However, the `discount` remains the same as it was calculated based on the previous `base_price`.\n   - When we recalculate the `final_price` using the formula provided, it does the following:\n     - It calculates the new discount as `(discount / new_base_price) * 100`.\n     - Then it subtracts this new discount from the `new_base_price` to get the new `final_price`.\n\n4. The key point here is that the discount is calculated relative to the original `base_price`, not the new one. So even though the `base_price` has increased, the discount amount stays the same unless explicitly recalculated based on the new price.\n\n5. As a result, the `final_price` will be:\n   - New `base_price` - Original discount percentage of the new `base_price`\n   - This could potentially be lower than the old `final_price` depending on how much the `base_price` increased compared to the discount percentage.\n\n6.
