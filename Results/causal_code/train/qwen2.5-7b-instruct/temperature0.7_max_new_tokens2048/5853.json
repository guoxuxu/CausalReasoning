    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `SalesData` class has a method `addSale` which adds a new sale amount to the `salesFigures` array.\n2. There is also an `addPromotion` method that adds a promotion to the `promotions` array and then calls `adjustSalesFigures`.\n3. The `adjustSalesFigures` method multiplies each element in the `salesFigures` array by 1.1 (i.e., increases them by 10%).\n4. If we add a sale using `addSale`, the `salesFigures` array will contain the original sale amount.\n5. Invoking `adjustSalesFigures` will modify all elements in the `salesFigures` array, including any newly added sales amounts.\n\nHowever, the question asks specifically about whether invoking `adjustSalesFigures` independently would increase the figure of a newly added sale. \n\nWhen we add a sale using `addSale`, the sale is added to the `salesFigures` array but is not yet adjusted. Only when `addPromotion` is called does `adjustSalesFigures` get invoked, which then increases all sale figures by 10%.\n\nTherefore, if we were to invoke `adjustSalesFigures` independently after adding a sale with `addSale`, it would indeed increase the figure of that newly added sale.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The question asks if invoking `adjustSalesFigures` independently would increase the figure of a newly added sale.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we add a sale independently:\n\n1. We can call `addSale(100)` to add a sale.\n2. There is no code that automatically calls `adjustSalesFigures` after adding a sale directly.\n\nSince there is no mechanism in the provided code that triggers `adjustSalesFigures` just after adding a sale, calling `adjustSalesFigures` independently would not affect the newly added sale's figure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `SalesData` class has methods to add sales figures and promotions.\n2. When a promotion is added using `addPromotion`, it calls the `adjustSalesFigures` method.\n3. `adjustSalesFigures` uses the `map` function to multiply each sales figure by 1.1 (which means a 10% increase).\n4. The question asks if calling `adjustSalesFigures` independently would increase a newly added sale.\n\nTo determine this:\n- If we call `adjustSalesFigures` independently after adding a sale but before adding a promotion, it will still apply the 10% increase to all existing sales figures, including the most recent one.\n- However, the key point here is that the method modifies the `salesFigures` array for all existing entries, not just the last one.\n\nSince the method affects all existing sales figures, and there's no mechanism to selectively apply the adjustment to only the last entry, simply calling `adjustSalesFigures` independently would indeed increase the figure of any newly added sale at the time of the call.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The `addPromotion` method adds a promotion to the `promotions` array and then calls `adjustSalesFigures`.\n\n4. Invoking `adjustSalesFigures` independently would apply the multiplication to all elements in `salesFigures`, but it wouldn't affect sales added after the last call to `adjustSalesFigures`.\n\n5. If we were to add a sale after calling `adjustSalesFigures` independently, the new sale would not be adjusted because it wasn't part of the original `salesFigures` array at the time of adjustment.\n\n6. However, if we add a sale and then call `adjustSalesFigures` on the same instance, it would adjust all sales figures, including the newly added one.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer to whether invoking `adjustSalesFigures` method independently increases the figure of a newly added sale is no, because it only affects existing sales figures at the time of the call and doesn't retroactively adjust new sales added afterward.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: A `SalesData` object is created with empty arrays for `salesFigures` and `promotions`.\n\n2. **Adding Sales**: Two sales figures (100 and 200) are added using the `addSale` method. These figures are stored in the `salesFigures` array.\n\n3. **Adding Promotion**: The `addPromotion` method is called with 'Winter Sale'. This method adds the promotion to the `promotions` array and then calls `adjustSalesFigures`.\n\n4. **Adjusting Sales Figures**: The `adjustSalesFigures` method multiplies each element in the `salesFigures` array by 1.1. This means every sale figure will be increased by 10%.\n\n5. **Calculating Total Sales**: Finally, the `calculateTotalSales` method sums up all elements in the `salesFigures` array.\n\nThe key point here is that the `adjustSalesFigures` method is only called when a promotion is added. It does not get invoked independently for newly added sales.\n\nGiven this information, if we were to call `adjustSalesFigures` independently after adding a new sale, it would not affect the newly added sale because the adjustment happens only after a promotion is added, not for each individual sale addition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `salesFigures` is initially empty.\n   - `promotions` is initially empty.\n\n2. **Adding Sales**:\n   - `sales.addSale(100)` adds `100` to `salesFigures`.\n   - `sales.addSale(200)` adds `200` to `salesFigures`.\n   - At this point, `salesFigures` contains `[100, 200]`.\n\n3. **Adding Promotion**:\n   - `sales.addPromotion('Winter Sale')` adds `'Winter Sale'` to `promotions` and calls `adjustSalesFigures()`.\n\n4. **Adjusting Sales Figures**:\n   - `adjustSalesFigures()` multiplies each element in `salesFigures` by `1.1`.\n   - This changes `salesFigures` from `[100, 200]` to `[110, 220]`.\n\n5. **Invoking adjustSalesFigures Independently**:\n   - If we invoke `adjustSalesFigures()` independently after adding a promotion but without adding any new sales, it will still multiply all current sales figures by `1.1`, but it won't affect a newly added sale because no new sales have been added yet.\n\n6. **Adding a New Sale Independently**:\n   - If we add a new sale independently (e.g., `sales.addSale(300)`), then `adjustSalesFigures()` will be called again, and it will apply the multiplication to the new sale as well.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Invoking `adjustSalesFigures` independently does not increase the figure of a newly added sale because it only affects the current sales figures that already exist. It doesn't modify the newly added sale until it is adjusted during the next call to `adjustSalesFigures`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `SalesData` class has methods for adding sales figures and promotions.\n2.

If we were to call `adjustSalesFigures` independently after adding a sale but before adding a promotion, it would only affect the sales figures that were already present at that moment.\n5. However, the question asks if calling `adjustSalesFigures` independently would increase the figure of a newly added sale.\n6. For a newly added sale to be affected by `adjustSalesFigures`, it must be added after the promotion and before the adjustment.\n7. Since `adjustSalesFigures` is not called until after a promotion is added (as per the code), any sale added before the promotion will not be adjusted.\n\nTherefore, calling `adjustSalesFigures` independently would not increase the figure of a newly added sale unless that sale is added after the promotion.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - `salesFigures` is initially empty.\n   - `promotions` is initially empty.\n\n2. **Adding Sales**:\n   - We add two sales figures (100 and 200) using `addSale`.\n   - `salesFigures` now contains [100, 200].\n\n3. **Adding Promotion**:\n   - We add a promotion ('Winter Sale') using `addPromotion`.\n   - This calls `adjustSalesFigures`.\n\n4. **Adjusting Sales Figures**:\n   - The `adjustSalesFigures` method multiplies each element in `salesFigures` by 1.1.\n   - So, `salesFigures` becomes [110, 220].\n\n5. **Independently Invoking adjustSalesFigures**:\n   - If we invoke `adjustSalesFigures` independently after adding a new sale but before adding the promotion, it will still multiply all existing sales figures by 1.1.\n   - However, the question specifically asks about a newly added sale being increased independently of any promotion.\n\n6. **Newly Added Sale**:\n   - Let's say we add a new sale (let's call it `newSale`) without calling `adjustSalesFigures` first.\n   - `salesFigures` would be [100, 200, newSale].\n   - If we then call `adjustSalesFigures`, `newSale` would also be multiplied by 1.1.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Invoking `adjustSalesFigures` independently does not increase the figure of a newly added sale on its own. It only affects the existing sales figures that were there before the adjustment.\n   - A newly added sale needs to be adjusted when `adjustSalesFigures` is called for all sales figures to be affected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `SalesData` class has two main methods: `addSale` and `addPromotion`.\n2. When `addSale` is called, it simply adds the sale amount to the `salesFigures` array.\n3. When `addPromotion` is called, it does two things:\n   - It adds the promotion to the `promotions` array.\n   - It calls the `adjustSalesFigures` method.\n4. The `adjustSalesFigures` method multiplies each element in the `salesFigures` array by 1.1.\n5. The question asks if invoking `adjustSalesFigures` independently would increase the figure of a newly added sale.\n6. If we call `adjustSalesFigures` independently after adding a sale but before adding any promotion, the `salesFigures` array will be adjusted as described, but only for the current state of the `salesFigures` array at that moment.\n7. However, if we want to ensure that a newly added sale is adjusted correctly, the `adjustSalesFigures` method must be called after the sale is added and before any other operations that might modify the `salesFigures` array.\n\nGiven the sequence of events in the provided code:\n- A sale of 100 is added.\n- Another sale of 200 is added.\n- Then, a promotion is added, which triggers `adjustSalesFigures`.\n\nIf we were to invoke `adjustSalesFigures` independently after adding the second sale but before adding the promotion, the sales figures would indeed be adjusted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nThis is because calling `adjustSalesFigures` independently after adding a sale but before any other operations on the `salesFigures` array will indeed increase the figure of the newly added sale by 10%."
