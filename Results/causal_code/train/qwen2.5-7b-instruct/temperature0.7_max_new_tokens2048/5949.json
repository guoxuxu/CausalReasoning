    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We have a `HealthSystem` class with properties `age` and `healthStatus`.\n2. The `updateAge` method changes the `age` property.\n3. If the `age` is greater than 50, the `updateHealthStatus` method sets `healthStatus` to 'at risk'.\n4. A `person` object is created with an initial age of 30.\n5. The `updateAge` method is called with a new age of 55.\n6. We need to determine if setting the age to 51 would change the health status to 'at risk'.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where the age is set to 51:\n\n- The `updateAge` method is called with `newAge = 51`.\n- Since 51 is greater than 50, the condition in the `updateAge` method (`if (this.age > 50)`) evaluates to true.\n- Therefore, the `updateHealthStatus` method is called with `newStatus = 'at risk'`.\n\nThus, setting the age to 51 would indeed change the health status to 'at risk'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Since the new age (55) is greater than 50, the `healthStatus` is updated to 'at risk'.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Would setting a person's age to 51 cause their health status to change to 'at risk'?\n\nGiven the logic in the `updateAge` method, we can see that:\n- The `updateAge` method checks if the new age is greater than 50.\n- If it is, the health status changes to 'at risk'.\n\nSetting the age to 51 (which is greater than 50) would trigger the condition in the `updateAge` method to change the health status to 'at risk'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Initially, we create a `person` object with `age` set to 30 and `healthStatus` as 'healthy'.\n5. We then call `person.updateAge(55)`, which sets the `age` to 55.\n6.
