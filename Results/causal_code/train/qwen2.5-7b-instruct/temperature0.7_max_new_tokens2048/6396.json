    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `activateSprinklers()` method returns true under two conditions:\n   - When it's not raining (`!isRaining`) AND the temperature is greater than 30.\n   - This means that if the sprinklers are activated, it must be because the temperature is above 30 and it's not raining.\n\n2. The `isMuddy()` method returns true if either:\n   - It's raining (`isRaining`), or\n   - The sprinklers have been activated (`activateSprinklers()`).\n\n3. If we see the sprinklers activated, we know for certain that it's not raining, as per the logic in `activateSprinklers()`.\n\n4. However, just because the sprinklers are activated doesn't necessarily mean it's definitely not raining. It could still be raining and the sprinklers could be activated due to high temperature, but seeing them activated confirms that it's not raining at the moment of observation.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that seeing the sprinklers activated does allow us to determine that it is not raining at that moment.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

It could be that the temperature is above 30 and it is not raining, which would still activate the sprinklers.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Seeing the sprinklers activated does not allow us to definitively conclude that it is raining.
