    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `update_sales` function takes three parameters: `records`, `product`, and `percentage_increase`.\n\n2. It checks if the `product` exists in the `records` dictionary.\n3. If it does, it updates the value of `product` in `records` by multiplying its current value by `(1 + percentage_increase / 100)`.\n4. This multiplication effectively increases the value by the given percentage.\n\nGiven:\n- `sales_records = {'apple': 150, 'banana': 200}`\n- We call `update_sales(sales_records, 'apple', 10)` which means we're increasing the sales of 'apple' by 10%.\n\n5. The calculation for 'apple' becomes: \n   `150 * (1 + 10/100) = 150 * 1.1 = 165`\n\n6. After updating, `updated_records` will be `{'apple': 165, 'banana': 200}`.\n\n7. The original value of 'apple' was 150, and after the update, it became 165.\n\n8. Since 165 is indeed higher than the original 150, the update did increase the value.\n\n9. The only way to increase the value without changing the `percentage_increase` would be to have an increase of exactly 0% (which would leave the value unchanged), or to remove or add items to the dictionary.\n\n10. Given that the problem statement specifies a non-zero percentage increase (10%), the value must have increased.\n\nTherefore, if the value of 'apple' in 'updated_records' is higher than originally, it does confirm that the 'percentage_increase' was greater than zero.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The `update_sales` function takes three parameters:\n   - `records`: A dictionary containing sales records.\n   - `product`: The product whose sales need to be updated.\n   - `percentage_increase`: The percentage by which the sales should be increased.\n\n2. **Condition Check**: Inside the function, it checks if the `product` exists in the `records` dictionary.\n3. **Update Logic**: If the product exists, the function updates its value by multiplying it with `(1 + percentage_increase / 100)`.

The updated record for 'apple' is now 165, which is indeed higher than the original 150.\n\n6. The question asks if this confirms that the `percentage_increase` was greater than zero.\n   - Since the new value (165) is higher than the original (150), the increase must have been positive.\n   - Therefore, the `percentage_increase` of 10% was indeed greater than zero.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

In the given code, `sales_records` is initially set to `{'apple': 150, 'banana': 200}`.\n\n4. The function `update_sales` is called with the arguments: `sales_records`, `'apple'`, and `10`.\n\n5. This means the value of `'apple'` in `sales_records` (which is 150) will be updated using a 10% increase.\n\n6. The new value for `'apple'` will be calculated as follows:\n   - Original value: 150\n   - Percentage increase: 10%\n   - New value: 150 * (1 + 10/100) = 150 * 1.10 = 165\n\n7.
