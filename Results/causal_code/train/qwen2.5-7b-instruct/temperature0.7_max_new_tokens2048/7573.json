  "Explanation": "Increasing the 'age_weight' raises the contribution of the 'age_score' component to the 'final_score', assuming the candidate's age and test score remain constant. Since the candidate is over 30, the higher 'age_weight' amplifies this segment of the score, hence increasing the 'final_score'.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Current Setup**:\n   - The function `compute_scores` calculates a final score based on age and test score.\n   - `age_weight = 0.3`\n   - `score_weight = 0.7`\n   - The formula for the final score is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_score} = (\\text{data['age']} \\times \\text{age\\_weight}) + (\\text{data['test\\_score']} \\times \\text{score\\_weight})\n     \\]\n\n2. **Impact of Increasing Age Weight**:\n   - If we increase the `age_weight`, it means that the contribution of the age to the final score will be more significant.\n   - For a candidate older than 30 with a constant test score, their age will have a larger impact on the final score because the weight assigned to age increases.\n\n3. **Mathematical Analysis**:\n   - Let's denote the age as \\( A \\) (where \\( A > 30 \\)) and the test score as \\( T \\).\n   - The current final score is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_score} = (A \\times 0.3) + (T \\times 0.7)\n     \\]\n   - If the age weight increases, let’s say to \\( w_{\\text{new}} \\), the new final score becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_score}_{\\text{new}} = (A \\times w_{\\text{new}}) + (T \\times 0.7)\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( A > 30 \\), increasing \\( w_{\\text{new}} \\) will result in a higher term \\( (A \\times w_{\\text{new}}) \\) compared to the original \\( (A \\times 0.3) \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the age of the candidate is greater than 30 and the test score remains constant, increasing the age weight will indeed result in an increase in the final score.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Current Formula**:\n   - `age_score = data['age'] * age_weight`\n   - `test_score = data['test_score'] * score_weight`\n   - `final_score = age_score + test_score`\n\n2. **Given Conditions**:\n   - The candidate is older than 30.\n   - The test score is constant.\n   - We need to determine if increasing `age_weight` will increase the `final_score`.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Since the test score is constant, any change in `final_score` will primarily be influenced by changes in `age_score`.\n   - `age_score` is calculated as `data['age'] * age_weight`.\n   - If `age_weight` increases, the product `data['age'] * age_weight` will also increase because `data['age']` is greater than 30 (which is a positive number).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both `age_score` and `test_score` are positively weighted, an increase in `age_weight` will directly contribute to an increase in `final_score`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

We know that for a candidate older than 30, the `data['age']` value is greater than 30.\n\n3. The `age_weight` is multiplied by `data['age']` to get `age_score`, which is then added to the product of `data['test_score']` and `score_weight` to get the `final_score`.\n\n4. If `age_weight` increases, the term `(\\text{data['age']} \\times \\text{age\\_weight})` will also increase because `data['age']` is a positive number (greater than 30).\n\n5. Since `data['test_score']` is kept constant, the term `(\\text{data['test\\_score']} \\times \\text{score\\_weight})` remains unchanged.\n\n6.
