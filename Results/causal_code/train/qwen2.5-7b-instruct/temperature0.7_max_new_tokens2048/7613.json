    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a class `WeatherForecast` with two attributes:\n   - `temperature`: an integer representing the current temperature.\n   - `isRaining`: a boolean indicating whether it is currently raining.\n\n2. The method `decideToCarryUmbrella()` checks two conditions:\n   - If the temperature is less than 20 degrees AND it is raining.\n\n3. According to the logic in `decideToCarryUmbrella()`:\n   - If both conditions (temperature < 20 AND isRaining) are true, the method returns `true`.\n   - Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n4. The question asks if someone will decide to carry an umbrella when the temperature is less than 20 degrees and it is raining.\n\n5.
