  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Upon updating the age from 17 to 19, the `update_age` method recalculates the `is_minor` status from `True` to `False`. Hence, no notification to law enforcement occurs since the condition `if user.is_minor` will not be satisfied.",
  "causal_map": "age → is_minor; age → notify_law_enforcement; is_minor → notify_law_enforcement",
  "causal_map_integration": "A user's age directly influences whether they are considered a minor, which in turn directly influences whether law enforcement needs to be notified.",
