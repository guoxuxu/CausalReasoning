    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: We start with some initial values for `userCount` and `systemLoad`, and a boolean `systemUpdate`.\n\n2. **User Count Increase**: When `addUser(int count)` is called with a significant count, `userCount` increases. The method then checks if `count > 10`. If true, it adds 5 to `systemLoad`.\n\n3. **System Update**: When `updateSystem()` is called, `systemUpdate` is set to true, and `systemLoad` is incremented by 10.

This will trigger the following logic:\n  - `systemLoad` will increase by 5 if `count > 10`.\n  - If `userCount > 100`, `systemLoad` will further increase by 20.\n\n- Simultaneously, the `updateSystem` method is called, setting `systemUpdate` to `true`.
