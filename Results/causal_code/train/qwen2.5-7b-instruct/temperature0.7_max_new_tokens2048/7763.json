    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `feels_like()` method adjusts the temperature based on humidity.\n2. If the humidity is greater than 80, it multiplies the temperature by 1.04.\n3. If the humidity is not greater than 80 (i.e., it's 80 or less), it returns the temperature as is.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we set the humidity to always be 85:\n\n4. With humidity fixed at 85, which is greater than 80, the condition `if self.humidity > 80` will always be true.\n5. This means that for any initial temperature, the `adjusted_temp` will always be calculated as `self.temperature * 1.04`.\n\nGiven this reasoning:\n\n- The result of `feels_like()` will indeed change for any initial temperature because the adjustment factor of 1.04 will always apply.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

In the `feels_like` method, the condition `if self.humidity > 80` will always be true when humidity is 85.\n2. Therefore, the line `adjusted_temp = self.temperature * 1.04` will always execute.\n3. This means that regardless of the initial temperature, multiplying it by 1.04 will always produce a different value (unless the temperature is 0, but even then, the result would be 0.04, which is different from the original temperature).\n\nSince the result of `feels_like()` will always be the initial temperature multiplied by 1.04 when humidity is 85, it will indeed change the result for any initial temperature (except for the edge case where temperature is 0).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Therefore, the line `adjusted_temp = self.temperature * 1.04` will always execute.\n\nSince the adjustment factor (1.04) is applied regardless of the actual temperature value, changing the humidity to 85 will always result in the same adjustment being made to the temperature.\n\nGiven this logic, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n\nModifying the humidity input to always be 85 will indeed change the result of `feels_like()` for any initial temperature, as the temperature will always be adjusted by 1.04.",
