    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Base Salary**: This is a fixed input and does not change based on the performance rating.\n\n2. **Bonus Calculation**:\n   - The bonus percentage is calculated as `0.05 * performance_rating`. As the performance rating increases, the bonus percentage also increases.\n   - The bonus amount is then calculated as `base_salary * bonus_percentage`. Since the base salary is fixed, an increase in the bonus percentage will directly lead to an increase in the bonus amount.\n\n3. **Years of Experience**:\n   - If `years_of_experience` is greater than 5, there is an additional flat bonus of $1000 added to the calculated bonus.\n   - This additional $1000 bonus is only dependent on the number of years of experience and not on the performance rating.\n\n4. **Total Salary Calculation**:\n   - The total salary is calculated as `base_salary + bonus`.\n   - Since the bonus is directly proportional to the performance rating (and there is a flat bonus for years of experience), if the performance rating increases, the bonus will increase, leading to an increase in the total salary.\n\nGiven that the bonus is directly influenced by the performance rating and the total salary includes this bonus, we can conclude that an increase in the performance rating will necessarily lead to an increase in the total calculated salary, assuming no changes to other inputs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's analyze the function step by step:\n\n1. **Base Salary Calculation**:\n   - The base salary is directly added to the final salary.\n   \n2. **Bonus Calculation Based on Performance Rating**:\n   - `bonus_percentage = 0.05 * performance_rating`\n   - `bonus = base_salary * bonus_percentage`\n   - This means the bonus is a percentage of the base salary that depends on the performance rating.\n\n3. **Experience Bonus**:\n   - If `years_of_experience > 5`, an additional fixed amount of 1000 is added to the bonus.\n\nNow, let's consider how the total salary changes with an increase in the performance rating:\n\n- **Increase in Performance Rating**:\n  - As the performance rating increases, the `bonus_percentage` also increases (since it's directly proportional).\n  - Consequently, the `bonus` will increase as well because it's a product of the base salary and the increased `bonus_percentage`.\n\n4. **Effect of Years of Experience**:\n   - If the years of experience are greater than 5, there is an additional 1000 added to the bonus.\n   - However, this is only dependent on the number of years of experience, not directly on the performance rating.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude:\n\n- An increase in the performance rating will always lead to an increase in the bonus, which is then added to the base salary.\n- The additional 1000 for more than 5 years of experience does not affect the direct relationship between the performance rating and the total salary.\n\nTherefore, if the performance rating increases, the total calculated salary would necessarily increase, assuming no changes to other inputs.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function computes the bonus based on the performance rating:\n   - `bonus_percentage = 0.05 * performance_rating`\n   - `bonus = base_salary * bonus_percentage`\n\n2. If the performance rating increases, `bonus_percentage` will also increase proportionally (assuming `performance_rating` is positive).\n\n3. This increase in `bonus_percentage` directly leads to an increase in `bonus`.\n\n4. The base salary (`base_salary`) remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.\n\n5. The function checks if `years_of_experience` is greater than 5. If it is, an additional $1000 is added to the bonus.\n\n6. However, the question specifically asks about the effect of increasing the performance rating, with no changes to other inputs.\n\n7. Since the base salary is not affected by the performance rating, and the only change is an increase in the bonus percentage which translates to an increase in the bonus amount, we can conclude that the total calculated salary will indeed increase when the performance rating increases.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the function to understand how the total calculated salary is determined:\n\n1. The function takes three parameters:\n   - `base_salary`: The base salary of an employee.\n   - `performance_rating`: A rating that affects the bonus percentage.\n   - `years_of_experience`: Years of experience that can affect the bonus.\n\n2. The function calculates a `bonus_percentage` based on the `performance_rating`:\n   ```python\n   bonus_percentage = 0.05 * performance_rating\n   ```\n   This means the bonus percentage is directly proportional to the performance rating.\n\n3. The `bonus` is then calculated as:\n   ```python\n   bonus = base_salary * bonus_percentage\n   ```\n   This means the bonus amount is also directly proportional to both the base salary and the performance rating.\n\n4. If the `years_of_experience` is greater than 5, an additional fixed bonus of 1000 is added to the `bonus`:\n   ```python\n   if years_of_experience > 5:\n       bonus += 1000\n   ```\n\n5. Finally, the total calculated salary is returned:\n   ```python\n   return base_salary + bonus\n   ```\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of increasing the `performance_rating`:\n- The `bonus_percentage` will increase proportionally with the `performance_rating`.\n- Since the `bonus` is calculated as `base_salary * bonus_percentage`, the `bonus` will also increase if the `performance_rating` increases, assuming the `base_salary` remains constant.\n- The additional 1000 bonus for `years_of_experience > 5` does not depend on the `performance_rating`.\n\nGiven this analysis, if only the `performance_rating` increases (and all other inputs remain constant), the `bonus` will increase, leading to an increase in the total calculated salary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's analyze the function step by step:\n\n1. **Bonus Calculation**: The bonus is calculated as `base_salary * (0.05 * performance_rating)`. This means the bonus depends directly on the performance rating.\n\n2. **Experience Bonus**: If `years_of_experience` is greater than 5, an additional fixed bonus of 1000 is added to the total bonus.\n\n3. **Total Salary Calculation**: The total salary is the sum of the base salary and the bonus.\n\nNow, let's consider how changes in the performance rating affect the total salary:\n\n- **Base Case**: If `performance_rating` increases, the bonus percentage (`bonus_percentage`) will also increase proportionally because it is directly proportional to the performance rating. Since the bonus is a part of the total salary, an increase in the bonus percentage due to a higher performance rating will result in a higher total salary, assuming all other inputs remain constant.\n\n- **Additional Bonus for Experience**: The additional 1000 dollar bonus only applies if `years_of_experience` is greater than 5. This does not change with the performance rating; it is an independent condition based on experience.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that an increase in the performance rating will lead to an increase in the bonus, which in turn leads to an increase in the total salary, assuming no changes to the base salary or years of experience.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."

However, the problem does not state that the years of experience have changed, so we can assume it remains the same for this analysis.\n\n4. **Bonus → Total Calculated Salary**: The total calculated salary is the sum of the base salary and the bonus. Since the bonus has increased, the total calculated salary will also increase, assuming no changes to the base salary.\n\n5. **Base Salary → Total Calculated Salary**: The base salary is a direct input to the function and is not affected by the performance rating in the given logic.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_salary` takes three inputs: `base_salary`, `performance_rating`, and `years_of_experience`.\n\n2. The first step is to calculate the `bonus_percentage`, which is directly proportional to the `performance_rating`. An increase in `performance_rating` will lead to an increase in `bonus_percentage`.\n\n3. The `bonus` is then calculated as `base_salary * bonus_percentage`. Since `bonus_percentage` has increased due to the higher `performance_rating`, the `bonus` will also increase.\n\n4. If `years_of_experience` is greater than 5, there's an additional fixed bonus of 1000 added to the `bonus`. However, the question assumes no changes to other inputs, so we don't need to consider this condition for now.\n\n5. The `total_calculated_salary` is the sum of `base_salary` and `bonus`. Since `bonus` increases with a higher `performance_rating`, the `total_calculated_salary` will also increase.\n\n6. Therefore, if the `performance_rating` increases, the `total_calculated_salary` will necessarily increase, given that all other inputs remain unchanged.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Performance Rating to Bonus Percentage**: If the performance rating increases, the bonus percentage (which is 0.05 times the performance rating) will also increase.\n\n2. **Bonus Percentage to Bonus**: An increase in the bonus percentage means that the bonus (which is the base salary multiplied by the bonus percentage) will increase as well.\n\n3. **Years of Experience to Bonus**: The statement checks if years of experience are greater than 5. If they are, it adds a fixed amount ($1000) to the bonus. However, the question does not specify how the years of experience change, so we assume they stay constant for the purpose of this analysis.\n\n4. **Bonus to Total Calculated Salary**: Since the total calculated salary is the base salary plus the bonus, any increase in the bonus will lead to an increase in the total calculated salary.\n\n5. **Base Salary to Total Calculated Salary**: The base salary is added to the bonus to get the total calculated salary. If the base salary remains constant, the only way the total calculated salary can change is if the bonus changes.\n\nGiven these points, an increase in the performance rating leads to an increase in both the bonus percentage and the bonus. Therefore, unless the base salary decreases or the years of experience condition is met which adds a fixed amount to the bonus, the total calculated salary will necessarily increase with an increase in the performance rating.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
