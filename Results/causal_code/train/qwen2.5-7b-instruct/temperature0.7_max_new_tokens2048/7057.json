    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `administer_medication` takes two parameters: `age` and `symptoms`.\n2. For a patient aged 55 with 'cough' as a symptom:\n   - The condition `age > 50 and 'cough' in symptoms` evaluates to True.\n   - Therefore, the medication assigned is 'DrugA'.\n3. When `medication` is 'DrugA', the effects are set to ['drowsiness', 'nausea'].\n\nGiven this information, we can conclude that a patient aged 55 reporting 'cough' will indeed experience 'drowsiness' as one of the effects of the medication.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `administer_medication` takes two parameters: `age` and `symptoms`.\n2. For a patient aged 55 (`age > 50`) and with symptoms including 'cough', the condition `if age > 50 and 'cough' in symptoms:` is met.\n3. When this condition is met, the variable `medication` is set to 'DrugA'.\n4. The next block of code checks the value of `medication`:\n   - If `medication == 'DrugA'`, the effects list is set to `['drowsiness', 'nausea']`.\n5. Since the patient's condition matches the criteria for 'DrugA', the effects list is set to `['drowsiness', 'nausea']`.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided logic, a patient aged 55 who reports a 'cough' will indeed experience 'drowsiness'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `administer_medication` takes two parameters: `age` and `symptoms`.\n2.

Given the patient's age is 55 (which is greater than 50) and they have a symptom of 'cough':\n   - This matches the first condition (`age > 50 and 'cough' in symptoms`).\n   - Therefore, `medication = 'DrugA'`.\n\n4. Next, we need to look at the side effects associated with `DrugA`:\n   - If `medication == 'DrugA'`, then `effects = ['drowsiness', 'nausea']`.\n\n5. Since `medication` is set to 'DrugA', the patient will experience the side effects listed for 'DrugA', which include 'drowsiness'.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to the question \"Will they experience 'drowsiness'?\" is Yes.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
