    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `weather_condition()` randomly selects between 'sunny', 'rainy', and 'cloudy' weather conditions.\n\n2. The function `people_visiting_park(weather)` determines the number of visitors based on the weather:\n   - If the weather is 'sunny', it returns a random integer between 80 and 100.\n   - If the weather is 'rainy', it returns a random integer between 0 and 20.\n   - If the weather is 'cloudy', it returns a random integer between 20 and 50.\n\n3. When the weather is 'sunny', the number of visitors is set to a random integer between 80 and 100.\n\n4. For other weather conditions (rainy or cloudy), the number of visitors is significantly lower, ranging from 0 to 50.\n\n5. Therefore, when the weather is sunny, the expected number of visitors is higher compared to rainy or cloudy weather.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that if the weather is sunny, there will indeed likely be more people visiting the park.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If the weather is 'sunny', the `people_visiting_park(weather)` function returns a random integer between 80 and 100 (inclusive).\n3. For other weather conditions ('rainy' or 'cloudy'), it returns a random integer between 0 and 20 for 'rainy', and 20 and 50 for 'cloudy'.\n4. Specifically for 'sunny' weather, the function guarantees a high number of visitors between 80 and 100.\n\nGiven that a sunny day is associated with a much higher range of visitors (80-100) compared to rainy days (0-20) or cloudy days (20-50), we can conclude that if the weather is sunny, there will indeed likely be more people visiting the park.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `weather_condition()` function returns one of three possible outcomes: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. The `people_visiting_park(weather)` function determines how many people visit the park based on the weather:\n   - If it's 'sunny', it returns a random integer between 80 and 100.\n   - If it's 'rainy', it returns a random integer between 0 and 20.\n   - If it's 'cloudy', it returns a random integer between 20 and 50.\n\n3. We need to focus specifically on the scenario where the weather is 'sunny'.\n\n4. When the weather is 'sunny', the number of visitors is determined by `random.randint(80, 100)`, which means the number of visitors can range from 80 to 100.\n\n5. Comparing this to the other conditions:\n   - 'Rainy' results in a much lower number (0 to 20).\n   - 'Cloudy' results in a moderate number (20 to 50).\n\n6. Given that 80 to 100 is significantly higher than the range for rainy weather (0 to 20) and is also higher than the range for cloudy weather (20 to 50), we can conclude that when the weather is sunny, there is indeed likely to be more people visiting the park.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

This range (80-100) is higher than the ranges for other weather conditions:\n   - 'Rainy': 0-20 (very low)\n   - 'Cloudy': 20-50 (moderate)\n\n6.
