    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficSystem` class has two attributes:\n   - `signal`: an integer that represents the traffic light color (1 for red, 0 for green).\n   - `isRaining`: a boolean indicating whether it is raining.\n\n2. The constructor sets the initial state based on the weather condition:\n   - If `isRaining` is true, the signal is set to 1 (red).\n   - If `isRaining` is false, the signal is set to 0 (green).\n\n3. The `getTrafficStatus()` method returns:\n   - 5 if the signal is 1 (indicating heavy traffic).\n   - 1 if the signal is 0 (indicating light traffic).\n\n4.
