    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial healthPoints are set to 100.\n2. The character does not have a shield equipped (`hasShield` is false).\n3. When `takeDamage(int damage)` is called with 50 damage:\n   - Since `hasShield` is false, the healthPoints will be reduced by the full amount of damage.\n4. The calculation is `healthPoints -= damage`, which translates to `healthPoints -= 50`.\n5. Starting with 100 healthPoints and subtracting 50 results in 50 healthPoints remaining.\n\nTherefore, after taking 50 damage without a shield, the healthPoints will indeed be 50.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
