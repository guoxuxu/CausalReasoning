    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `promotionalEvent` method is defined to handle the scenario where a promotional event occurs.\n2. It takes one parameter: `discountRate`, which represents the discount percentage.\n3. Inside the method, there is a conditional check: `if (discountRate > 20)`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the condition is true (i.e., the discount rate is greater than 20):\n\n4. If the condition is met, the following two lines execute:\n   - `this.customers += 10;`\n   - `this.sales += 50;`\n\nThe key point here is that the line `this.customers += 10;` directly increases the number of customers by 10.\n\nTherefore, if the store runs a promotional event with a high discount rate (greater than 20), there will indeed be an increase in the number of customers.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Code**: The `Store` class has methods for managing the number of customers and sales. It also includes a method `promotionalEvent` that modifies these values based on a given discount rate.\n\n2. **Identify the Condition**: In the `promotionalEvent` method, there is a condition that checks if the `discountRate` is greater than 20.\n\n3. **Effect of High Discount Rate**: If the `discountRate` is indeed greater than 20, then the `promotionalEvent` method will execute the following actions:\n   - Increase the number of customers by 10.\n   - Increase the number of sales by 50.\n\n4. **Causal Relationship**: The problem specifically asks about the relationship between the `promotionalEvent` and the `customers`. According to the code, running a promotional event with a high discount rate (greater than 20) directly increases the number of customers by 10.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that if the store runs a promotional event with a high discount rate, there will be an increase in the number of customers.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The line `this.customers += 10;` directly increases the number of customers by 10.\n\n6. This increase in customers is specifically triggered when the `discountRate` is greater than 20.\n\n7.
