    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `add_traffic` method checks two conditions:\n   - If `increased_traffic` is True\n   - If `self.is_green` is True\n\n2. If both conditions are met, it calls the `switch_to_red` method.\n\n3. For `switch_to_red` to be called, `self.is_green` must be True at that moment.\n\n4. However, we need to consider the timing and sequence of events:\n   - When does `add_traffic` get called?\n   - Can `is_green` change between checking the conditions and calling `switch_to_red`?\n\n5. The `add_traffic` method does not explicitly check the state of `is_green` again after checking `increased_traffic`. \n\n6. This means if `is_green` was False when `add_traffic` was called but became True later (before `switch_to_red` is called), `switch_to_red` would not be invoked.\n\n7. Therefore, the mere presence of increased traffic does not necessarily imply that `is_green` was previously True; it only implies that `is_green` is True at the time of calling `switch_to_red`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `add_traffic` method has a conditional statement that checks `if increased_traffic and self.is_green`.\n\n2. For the condition to be true, both `increased_traffic` must be True and `self.is_green` must be True.\n\n3. The question asks if the appearance of increased traffic implies that `is_green` was previously True.\n\n4. From the condition in the `add_traffic` method, we can see that for the method to switch the light to red (`switch_to_red()`), `is_green` must be True at the time the method is called.\n\n5. Therefore, the presence of increased traffic (which triggers the method) does indeed imply that `is_green` was previously True.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If both conditions are met (i.e., `increased_traffic` is True and `self.is_green` is True), then the method calls `switch_to_red`.\n3. The `switch_to_red` method sets `self.is_green` to False and `self.is_red` to True.\n\nFor the `add_traffic` method to call `switch_to_red`, the condition `self.is_green` must be True when `add_traffic` is called. \n\nTherefore, for the appearance of increased traffic to imply that `is_green` was previously True, it must be true that `is_green` was True before `add_traffic` was called.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1.

If both conditions are met (i.e., there is increased traffic AND the light is currently green), then it switches to red.\n\n3. For the switch to occur, we need to satisfy both conditions:\n   - There must be increased traffic.\n   - The light must be green at the time of checking.\n\n4.

Based on the logic in the `add_traffic` method, for the light to switch from green to red due to increased traffic, `is_green` must have been True at the moment of calling `add_traffic`.\n\nTherefore, the appearance of increased traffic does indeed imply that `is_green` was previously True.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

It does not depend on any conditions other than being called.\n\n3. **add_traffic Method**: This method checks if there is increased traffic (`increased_traffic`) and if the current state is green (`self.is_green`).

There must be increased traffic (`increased_traffic`).\n     2. The light must currently be green (`self.is_green`).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The presence of increased traffic alone does not guarantee that `is_green` was previously `True`.\n   - Increased traffic could cause the light to switch from green to red, but it could also cause the light to switch from another color (like yellow or red) to red without `is_green` being `True`.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and code, we cannot conclude with certainty that `is_green` was previously `True` just because there is increased traffic.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
