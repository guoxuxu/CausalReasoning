    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `OnlineStore` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the inventory amount.\n2. The `purchase` method checks if the `order_quantity` is greater than the current `inventory_amount`.\n3. If the order quantity exceeds the inventory, it returns a specific error message: \"Order too large, cannot fulfill.\"\n4. If the order can be fulfilled, it subtracts the `order_quantity` from `inventory_amount` and returns a success message: \"Order fulfilled.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the provided code:\n\n```python\nstore = OnlineStore(100)\nresponse1 = store.purchase(70)  # This should succeed and reduce inventory to 30\nresponse2 = store.purchase(40)  # This should fail because inventory is now 30\n```\n\n- After `response1`, the inventory is reduced to 30.\n- When `response2` is called with an order quantity of 40, which is more than the remaining inventory (30), it will return the failure message: \"Order too large, cannot fulfill.\"\n\nThe failure message does not provide any information about the original inventory amount; it only indicates that the order quantity exceeded the current inventory.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `OnlineStore` class has an attribute `inventory_amount` which is set to 100 when the instance is created.\n\n2. The `purchase` method checks if the `order_quantity` is greater than `inventory_amount`. If it is, it returns a specific error message \"Order too large, cannot fulfill.\"\n\n3. In the provided code:\n   - `response1 = store.purchase(70)` would succeed because 70 is less than the initial inventory of 100.\n   - `response2 = store.purchase(40)` would also succeed as 40 is less than the remaining inventory after the first purchase.\n\n4. The question asks if we can determine the original inventory from the response message of a failed order.\n\n5. If a purchase attempt fails (i.e., `order_quantity > inventory_amount`), the message returned is always \"Order too large, cannot fulfill.\" This message does not contain any information about the original inventory amount.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the response message alone, we cannot deduce the original inventory amount.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The provided code snippet shows two purchase attempts:\n   - `store.purchase(70)` (which fulfills the order)\n   - `store.purchase(40)` (which also fulfills the order)\n\n6. The initial inventory amount was set to 100 in the constructor.\n\n7. Changing the response message for a failed order would mean modifying the error message to something like \"Insufficient inventory, cannot fulfill.\" However, even with a different message, the content of the message itself does not contain information about the original inventory amount.\n\n8. The error message only indicates whether the order can be fulfilled or not based on the current inventory level, but it does not reveal the exact value of the initial inventory.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
