    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_bonus(sales, quota)` checks if `sales` is greater than `quota`.\n2. If `sales` is greater than `quota`, it returns 10% of the difference between `sales` and `quota`.\n3. If `sales` is not greater than `quota`, it returns 0.\n4. In the `main()` function, `sales` is set to 15000 and `quota` is set to 10000.\n5. When we call `compute_bonus(sales, quota)`, we can see that `sales` (15000) is indeed greater than `quota` (10000).\n6. Therefore, the function should return a positive value, not 0.\n\nHowever, the question asks what happens if the 'bonus' is zero. Let's consider the scenario where `bonus` is zero:\n\n- For `bonus` to be zero, the condition inside the `if` statement must not be true.\n- This means `sales` must not be greater than `quota`.\n\nSo, if the 'bonus' is zero, it does indeed mean that 'sales' did not exceed the 'quota'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If `sales <= quota`, it returns 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `bonus` is zero:\n\n- For `bonus` to be zero, the condition inside the function must not be met (`sales <= quota`).\n- This means `sales` is not greater than `quota`.\n\nGiven the code logic, if `bonus` is zero, it indeed indicates that `sales` did not exceed the `quota`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the `compute_bonus` function which calculates the bonus based on sales and quota.\n2. The function returns 0.1 * (sales - quota) if sales > quota, otherwise it returns 0.\n3. In the `main` function, we set sales to 15000 and quota to 10000.\n4. We call `compute_bonus(sales, quota)` and assign the result to `bonus`.\n5. To determine if `bonus` being zero means sales did not exceed the quota, let's consider both scenarios:\n   - If sales > quota, then `bonus = 0.1 * (sales - quota)`. For `bonus` to be zero, (sales - quota) must be zero, meaning sales equals quota.\n   - If sales ≤ quota, then `bonus = 0`.\n\n6. From the given logic, we can see that if `sales` exceeds `quota`, `bonus` would be a positive value, not zero.\n7. Therefore, if `bonus` is zero, it confirms that `sales` did not exceed `quota`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

In the `main` function:\n   - `sales` is set to 15000.\n   - `quota` is set to 10000.\n   - The `compute_bonus` function is called with these values.\n\n4. Since `sales` (15000) is indeed greater than `quota` (10000), the condition `sales > quota` is true.\n\n5. Therefore, the function returns `0.1 * (sales - quota)` which calculates to `0.1 * (15000 - 10000) = 500`.\n\n6. However, the question states that the `bonus` is zero. This would only happen if the condition `sales > quota` is false.\n\n7. The provided code and the statement about `bonus` being zero contradict each other based on the given logic in the `compute_bonus` function.\n\nGiven the causal relationship described in the problem:\n\n- If `sales > quota`, then `bonus ≠ 0`.\n- If `sales ≤ quota`, then `bonus = 0`.\n\nSince the code explicitly implements this logic, and the `bonus` is printed as 500 when `sales` exceeds `quota`, the statement \"if the 'bonus' is zero, does this mean that 'sales' did not exceed the 'quota'\" is correct according to the provided logic.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

According to the function logic, if `sales > quota`, the function returns 0.1 * (sales - quota).\n7. However, the question asks what happens when `bonus` is zero.\n8.
