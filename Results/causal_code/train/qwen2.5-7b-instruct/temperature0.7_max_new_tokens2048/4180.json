    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_scores(data)` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. We are setting 'A', 'B', and 'C' to zero.\n3.

Next, since 'D' is positive, we use the condition in the `if` statement:\n   \\[\n   \\text{if data['D'] > 0:}\n   \\]\n   This means:\n   \\[\n   s2 = s1 \\cdot 2\n   \\]\n   Substituting the value of `s1`:\n   \\[\n   s2 = 0 \\cdot 2 = 0\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, when 'A', 'B', and 'C' are zero and 'D' is positive, `s2` will indeed be zero.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
