    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the `weatherStatus` method**:\n   - If the temperature is greater than 30, it returns \"Hot\".\n   - If the temperature is less than 10, it returns \"Cold\".\n   - For all other temperatures, it returns \"Moderate\".\n\n2. **Given condition**:\n   - The `weatherStatus` method returns \"Moderate\". This means the temperature must be between 10 and 30 (inclusive).\n\n3. **Experimental intervention**:\n   - The temperature is artificially adjusted by 20 degrees lower.\n   - We need to determine if the original temperature necessarily exceeded 10 degrees.\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - Let \\( T \\) be the original temperature.\n   - After the adjustment, the new temperature is \\( T - 20 \\).\n   - Since the new temperature is moderate, it must lie between 10 and 30.\n   - Therefore, \\( 10 \\leq T - 20 \\leq 30 \\).\n\n5. **Solving the inequality**:\n   - Adding 20 to all parts of the inequality:\n     \\[\n     10 + 20 \\leq T \\leq 30 + 20\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     30 \\leq T \\leq 50\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the inequality \\( 30 \\leq T \\leq 50 \\), we can see that the original temperature \\( T \\) is at least 30.\n   - Since 30 is greater than 10, the original temperature necessarily exceeded 10 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `weatherStatus` method returns \"Moderate\" if the temperature is between 10 and 30 degrees (inclusive).\n\n2. This means the original temperature must have been within this range:\n   - Lower bound: 10 degrees (inclusive)\n   - Upper bound: 30 degrees (inclusive)\n\n3. An experimental intervention then decreases the recorded temperature by 20 degrees.\n\n4. We need to determine if the original temperature necessarily exceeded 10 degrees after this adjustment.\n\n5. Let's consider the boundary condition first:\n   - If the original temperature was exactly 10 degrees, decreasing it by 20 degrees would result in -10 degrees, which is not possible since temperatures cannot be negative in this context.\n   \n6. Therefore, the original temperature must have been at least 10 + 20 = 30 degrees to avoid this issue.\n\n7. Since the original temperature was at least 30 degrees, it definitely exceeded 10 degrees even before the adjustment.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If the original temperature was exactly 20 degrees, decreasing it by 20 degrees would result in 0 degrees, which is not \"Moderate\".\n\n6. Therefore, for the temperature to remain in the \"Moderate\" range after being decreased by 20 degrees, it must have been more than 20 degrees originally.\n\n7. Since any temperature over 20 degrees is also above 10 degrees, we can conclude that the original temperature necessarily exceeded 10 degrees.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
