    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_sales_data` calculates the total sales, then applies a tax rate to get the total tax, and finally adds the tax to the total sales to get the final revenue.\n\n2. The formula used is:\n   - `total_sales = sum(sales_data)`\n   - `total_tax = total_sales * tax_rate`\n   - `final_revenue = total_sales + total_tax`\n\n3. We need to determine if `final_revenue` can be equal to the sum of `sales_figures` (i.e., `100 + 200 + 300 = 600`).\n\n4. For `final_revenue` to be equal to the sum of `sales_figures`, the equation would be:\n   - `total_sales + total_tax = total_sales`\n   - This simplifies to: `total_sales * (1 + tax_rate) = total_sales`\n\n5. Simplifying further:\n   - `1 + tax_rate = 1`\n   - Therefore, `tax_rate = 0`\n\n6. So, for `final_revenue` to be exactly equal to the sum of `sales_figures`, `tax_rate` must indeed be 0.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Given:\n   - `sales_figures = [100, 200, 300]`\n   - `tax_percentage = 0.05`\n\n3. Calculate the total sales:\n   - `total_sales = 100 + 200 + 300 = 600`\n\n4.

Now, let's consider if the computed 'revenue' is exactly equal to the sum of 'sales_figures':\n   - The sum of `sales_figures` is `600`.\n   - The computed `revenue` is `630`.\n\n7. If the computed 'revenue' were exactly equal to the sum of 'sales_figures', it would mean:\n   - `final_revenue = total_sales + total_tax = total_sales`\n   - This implies `total_tax = 0`\n\n8.

For the final revenue to be equal to the sum of sales figures (600), the total tax would have to be zero.\n\n6. The formula for total tax is `total_sales * tax_rate`.

From the calculation above, we see that when `tax_percentage = 0.05`, `final_revenue` is 630, not 600.
