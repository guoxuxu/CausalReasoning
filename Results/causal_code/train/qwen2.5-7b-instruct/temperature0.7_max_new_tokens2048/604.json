    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Car` class has an attribute `engine_status` which is initialized to 'off'.\n2. The `start_engine` method changes `engine_status` to 'on'.\n3. The `is_engine_on` method checks if `engine_status` is 'on' and returns a boolean value based on that.\n4. In the provided usage example, `start_engine` is called to explicitly set `engine_status` to 'on'.\n5. However, the question asks about a scenario where `engine_status` is set to 'on' externally, without using the `start_engine` method.\n\nIf `engine_status` is set to 'on' externally, it would directly modify the `engine_status` attribute of the `Car` instance to 'on'.\n\n6. Given this change, when `is_engine_on()` is called, it will check the current value of `engine_status`, which is now 'on'.\n\nTherefore, `is_engine_on()` would indeed return 'True' (or more accurately, True, since Python uses a boolean context).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
