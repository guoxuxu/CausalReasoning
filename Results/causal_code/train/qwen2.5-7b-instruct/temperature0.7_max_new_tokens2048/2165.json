    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `analyze_student_performance` function calculates a final grade based on three components:\n   - Grades (weighted at 60%)\n   - Study time (weighted at 30%)\n   - Attendance (weighted at 10%)\n\n2. The formula used to calculate the final grade is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{final\\_grade} = (0.6 \\times \\text{grades}) + (0.3 \\times \\text{study\\_time}) + (0.1 \\times \\text{attendance})\n   \\]\n\n3. In the provided example:\n   - Grades = 85\n   - Study time = 75\n   - Attendance = 90\n\n4. If a tutor intervention improves study time, the new value for `study_time` will be higher than 75.\n\n5. Since study time has a significant weight (30%) in the calculation of the final grade, an increase in its value will result in a higher final grade, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n\nTherefore, if a tutor intervention improves study time, it will indeed change the final score.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
