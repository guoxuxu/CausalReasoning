  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Intervening by setting 'isCpuOverloaded' to false and checking 'isMemoryFull' to be true means that the system check condition '(isCpuOverloaded || isMemoryFull)' still returns true if the memory is full. Thus, a notification will still be sent when memory is full, independent of the CPU status after the intervention.",

    "Let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - `isCpuOverloaded` can be either `true` or `false`.\n   - `isMemoryFull` can be either `true` or `false`.\n   - `notificationSent` is initially `false`.\n\n2. **System Check Process**:\n   - The `checkSystemHealth()` method checks both `isCpuOverloaded` and `isMemoryFull`.\n   - If either is `true`, it calls `sendNotification()`.\n\n3. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - We are specifically interested in the case where `isMemoryFull` is `true` and `isCpuOverloaded` is reset to `false`.\n   - In this case, only `isMemoryFull` is `true`.\n\n4. **Outcome**:\n   - Since `isMemoryFull` is `true` and `isCpuOverloaded` is `false`, the condition `isCpuOverloaded || isMemoryFull` will still evaluate to `true`.\n   - Therefore, `sendNotification()` will be called, setting `notificationSent` to `true`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, even if the CPU status is reset to not overloaded, a notification will still be sent if the memory is full.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
