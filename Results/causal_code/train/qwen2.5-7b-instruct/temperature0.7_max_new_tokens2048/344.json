    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to determine if wearing a t-shirt necessarily implies the heater was turned on.\n\n2. The `decision` function determines clothing based on the temperature:\n   - If temperature ≤ 7, wear jacket\n   - If temperature > 20, wear t-shirt\n   - Otherwise, wear normal clothes\n\n3. For someone to be wearing a t-shirt, the temperature must be greater than 20 according to the `decision` function.\n\n4. Now, let's look at the `update_temperature` function:\n   - For cold weather (base_temp = 5), the adjusted temperature is 10 (if heater is on) or 3 (if off).\n   - For warm weather (base_temp = 15), the adjusted temperature is 20 (if heater is on) or 13 (if off).\n   - For other weather (base_temp = 10), the adjusted temperature is 15 (if heater is on) or 8 (if off).\n\n5. To get a temperature > 20:\n   - We need to be in warm weather with the heater on (adjusted_temp = 20)\n\n6. It's possible to get a temperature > 20 with the heater off (in warm weather, adjusted_temp = 13), but this would not result in wearing a t-shirt.\n\n7. Therefore, for someone to be wearing a t-shirt, it must be warm weather with the heater on, as any other combination of weather and heater status would not result in a temperature > 20.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `update_temperature` function calculates an adjusted temperature based on the weather and whether the heater is on or off.\n2. For a cold weather:\n   - Base temp is 5\n   - If heater is on, adjusted temp becomes 10 (5 + 5)\n   - If heater is off, adjusted temp becomes 3 (5 - 2)\n3. For warm weather:\n   - Base temp is 15\n   - If heater is on, adjusted temp becomes 20 (15 + 5)\n   - If heater is off, adjusted temp becomes 13 (15 - 2)\n4. For other weather conditions:\n   - Base temp is 10\n   - If heater is on, adjusted temp becomes 15 (10 + 5)\n   - If heater is off, adjusted temp becomes 8 (10 - 2)\n\n5. The `decision` function decides what to wear based on the temperature:\n   - ≤ 7: Wear jacket\n   - > 20: Wear t-shirt\n   - Otherwise: Normal clothes\n\nGiven that someone is wearing a t-shirt, we know the temperature must be greater than 20. \n\nFrom the calculations above:\n- The only way to get a temperature > 20 is if the heater is on in warm weather (20) or in other weather conditions (15).\n\nHowever, there could also be other scenarios where the temperature naturally falls within the range for a t-shirt without the heater being on, such as in warm weather with the heater off (13).\n\nTherefore, seeing someone wear a t-shirt does not definitively mean the heater was turned on.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `update_temperature` function calculates an adjusted temperature based on the current weather and whether the heater is on or off.\n2. For different weather conditions:\n   - Cold weather sets a base temperature of 5.\n   - Warm weather sets a base temperature of 15.\n   - Any other weather sets a base temperature of 10.\n3. If the heater is on:\n   - The adjusted temperature will be the base temperature plus 5.\n4. If the heater is off:\n   - The adjusted temperature will be the base temperature minus 2.\n5. The `decision` function then determines what kind of clothes to wear based on the temperature:\n   - If temperature is <= 7, wear a jacket.\n   - If temperature is > 20, wear a t-shirt.\n   - Otherwise, wear normal clothes.\n\nNow, for a person to be wearing a t-shirt, the temperature must be greater than 20. Let's see if this can happen with the heater off:\n\n- With cold weather (base temp = 5), the maximum possible adjusted temperature (with heater off) is 5 - 2 = 3.\n- With warm weather (base temp = 15), the maximum possible adjusted temperature (with heater off) is 15 - 2 = 13.\n- With any other weather (base temp = 10), the maximum possible adjusted temperature (with heater off) is 10 - 2 = 8.\n\nIn none of these scenarios can the temperature exceed 20 when the heater is off. Therefore, if someone is wearing a t-shirt, it must mean the temperature is greater than 20, which implies the heater was definitely turned on.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `decision` function determines what clothes to wear based on the temperature.\n2. A person wearing a t-shirt corresponds to a temperature greater than 20 degrees (from the `decision` function).\n3. We need to check if this temperature range can be achieved with the heater off.\n\nLooking at the `update_temperature` function:\n\n4. If the weather is 'cold', the base temperature is 5.\n5. If the heater is off, the adjusted temperature would be 5 - 2 = 3.\n6. If the weather is 'warm', the base temperature is 15.\n7. If the heater is off, the adjusted temperature would be 15 - 2 = 13.\n8. If the weather is neither 'cold' nor 'warm', the base temperature is 10.\n9. If the heater is off, the adjusted temperature would be 10 - 2 = 8.\n\nIn all cases, even when the heater is off, the lowest temperature we get is 3 degrees (in cold weather). This means a temperature above 20 degrees can only be achieved with the heater on.\n\nTherefore, seeing someone wear a t-shirt implies that the temperature must be above 20 degrees, which can only happen if the heater was on.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `decision` function decides what kind of clothes to wear based on the temperature.\n2. A t-shirt is worn when the temperature is greater than 20 (from the `decision` function logic).\n3. Now, let's consider the `update_temperature` function:\n   - If the weather is cold, the base temperature with heater on is 10 (5 + 5), and off is 8 (5 - 2).\n   - If the weather is warm, the base temperature with heater on is 20 (15 + 5), and off is 13 (15 - 2).\n   - If the weather is neither cold nor warm, the base temperature with heater on is 15 (10 + 5), and off is 8 (10 - 2).\n\n4. For a t-shirt to be worn, the temperature must be greater than 20.\n5. Looking at the possible temperatures for each condition:\n   - Cold weather: Only with the heater on can the temperature reach above 20 (10 + 5 = 15, which is not > 20; 8 - 2 = 6, which is also not > 20).\n   - Warm weather: The temperature will always be above 20 with the heater on (20 + 5 = 25) and above 20 with the heater off (13 - 2 = 11, but this is not > 20).\n   - Neither cold nor warm: The only way to have a temperature > 20 is with the heater on (15 + 5 = 20, which is not > 20; 8 - 2 = 6, which is also not > 20).\n\nTherefore, for someone to be wearing a t-shirt, the only consistent scenario is when the heater is on, regardless of the weather.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Weather and Heater Status Impact Temperature**:\n   - If the weather is cold, the base temperature is 5.\n   - If the weather is warm, the base temperature is 15.\n   - If the weather is neither cold nor warm, the base temperature is 10.\n   - If the heater is on, the temperature is adjusted by adding 5 to the base temperature.\n   - If the heater is off, the temperature is adjusted by subtracting 2 from the base temperature.\n\n2. **Temperature Determines the Decision**:\n   - If the temperature is 7 or below, the person will wear a jacket.\n   - If the temperature is 20 or above, the person will wear a t-shirt.\n   - Otherwise, they will wear normal clothes.\n\n3. **Given Information**:\n   - We see someone wearing a t-shirt.\n   - According to the decision function, for a person to wear a t-shirt, the temperature must be greater than 20.\n\n4. **Possible Scenarios for a Temperature Greater Than 20**:\n   - If the weather is warm (base temp = 15) and the heater is on (adjusted temp = 15 + 5 = 20), the temperature would be exactly 20, which means they would not wear a t-shirt but rather normal clothes.\n   - For the temperature to be greater than 20, either:\n     - The weather must be warm and the heater must be on, resulting in an adjusted temperature of 20+.\n     - The weather must be neither cold nor warm, and the heater must be on, resulting in an adjusted temperature of 10+5 = 15 (which is not enough).\n     - The weather must be cold, and the heater must be on, resulting in an adjusted temperature of 5+5 = 10 (which is not enough).\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only scenario where the temperature can be greater than 20 is when the weather is warm and the heater is on. However, since we cannot have a temperature of exactly 20 when wearing a t-shirt, the heater must be on for the temperature to be greater than 20.\n\nTherefore, seeing someone wear a t-shirt does indeed imply that the heater was definitely turned on.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to determine if seeing someone wearing a t-shirt means the heater was definitely turned on.\n   - The key information provided is the relationship between `weather`, `heater_status`, `temperature`, and the `decision` made based on the temperature.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Code:**\n   - The `update_temperature` function calculates the adjusted temperature based on the weather and whether the heater is on or off.\n   - The `decision` function determines what clothing to wear based on the temperature.\n\n3. **Decision Based on Temperature:**\n   - If the temperature is greater than 20, the person will wear a t-shirt.\n   - This means that for someone to wear a t-shirt, the temperature must be above 20.\n\n4. **Temperature Calculation:**\n   - For a temperature to be above 20:\n     - In cold weather (`weather == 'cold'`), the base temperature is 5. Adding 5 (if the heater is on) gives 10. Subtracting 2 (if the heater is off) gives 3. So, for the temperature to be above 20, the heater must be on.\n     - In warm weather (`weather == 'warm'`), the base temperature is 15. Adding 5 (if the heater is on) gives 20.
