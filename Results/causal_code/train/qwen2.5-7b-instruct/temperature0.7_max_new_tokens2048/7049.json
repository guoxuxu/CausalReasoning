    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_discount` takes two parameters: `cart_items` and `promo_code`.\n2. It calculates the `total` price of all items in the cart.\n3. If the `promo_code` is 'SAVE10', it applies a 10% discount to the total.\n4. If the `promo_code` is 'SAVE20', it applies a 20% discount to the total.\n5. If neither 'SAVE10' nor 'SAVE20' is provided, no discount is applied, and the `net_price` is simply the `total`.\n\nNow, considering the question:\n- If there is no applicable promo code, the `discount` remains 0.\n- Therefore, the `net_price` calculation (`net_price = total - discount`) would result in `net_price = total`, meaning the `net_price` is exactly the same as the `total`.\n\nChanges in `cart_items` (such as adding more items or changing quantities) would affect the `total` because the `total` is recalculated based on the current state of `cart_items`. However, since no discount is applied when the promo code is not applicable, these changes only influence the `net_price` by changing its value to the new `total`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is that yes, changes in `cart_items` would still influence the `net_price` even if the promo code is not applicable.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_discount` calculates the `total` price of items in the `cart_items`.\n2. If a valid `promo_code` is provided (either 'SAVE10' or 'SAVE20'), it applies a discount to the `total` based on that code.\n3. If no valid `promo_code` is provided, the `discount` remains 0.\n4. Regardless of whether a discount is applied or not, the `net_price` is calculated as `total - discount`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens if no valid `promo_code` is provided:\n- The `discount` will remain 0 because neither 'SAVE10' nor 'SAVE20' matches the input `promo_code`.\n- Therefore, `net_price = total - 0`, which means `net_price` is simply the `total`.\n\nIn this scenario, the `net_price` is directly influenced by the `cart_items` because the `total` is calculated based on the prices and quantities of the items in the cart.\n\nSo, even without a discount being applied, changes in `cart_items` (such as adding or removing items, or changing their prices or quantities) would still influence the `net_price`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
