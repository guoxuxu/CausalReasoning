    "Let's break down the logic of the `compute_scores` function to determine if a student's final score not including the bonus means they scored 70 or more on their previous test.\n\n1. **Base Score Calculation**:\n   - If `x > 5`, then `base_score = 0.6 * x`.\n   - Otherwise, `base_score = 0.4 * x`.\n\n2. **Final Score Calculation**:\n   - If `y < 70`, then `final_score = base_score + bonus`.\n   - Otherwise, `final_score = base_score`.\n\n3. **Bonus Condition**:\n   - The bonus is only added if `y < 70`.\n\nGiven that the final score does not include the bonus, we can infer the following:\n- For the final score to not include the bonus, it must be the case that `y >= 70`. This is because the bonus is only added when `y < 70`.\n\nTherefore, if the final score does not include the bonus, it means `y >= 70`.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"Did they necessarily score 70 or more on their previous tests?\" is Yes.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
