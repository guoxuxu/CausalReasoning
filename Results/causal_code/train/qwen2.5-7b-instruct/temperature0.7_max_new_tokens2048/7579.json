    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the function**:\n   - The `compute_values` function takes two parameters: `temp` (temperature) and `pressure`.\n   - It calculates the boiling point using the formula: `boiling_point = 100 + (pressure - 1) * 0.5`.\n   - Based on the comparison of `temp` with `boiling_point`, it determines the state of matter ('Gas', 'Transition', or 'Liquid').\n\n2. **Initial conditions**:\n   - We need to know the initial temperature (`temp`) and the initial pressure.\n   - The pressure is adjusted to 1 atmosphere for the new condition.\n\n3. **Boiling Point Calculation at 1 Atmosphere**:\n   - At 1 atmosphere, the pressure is `1`.\n   - Plugging this into the formula: `boiling_point = 100 + (1 - 1) * 0.5 = 100`.\n\n4. **State Determination**:\n   - If the temperature remains the same as the initial temperature and is less than 100, the state will be 'Liquid'.\n   - If the temperature is exactly 100, the state will be 'Transition'.\n   - If the temperature is greater than 100, the state will be 'Gas'.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - For the state to be 'Liquid', the temperature must be less than 100.\n   - If the temperature remains the same and is less than 100, then setting the pressure to 1 atmosphere will indeed ensure the state is 'Liquid'.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_values(temp, pressure)` calculates the boiling point based on the given pressure.\n2. For 1 atmosphere of pressure:\n   - The boiling point calculation is: 100 + (1 - 1) * 0.5 = 100 degrees.\n3. If the temperature remains the same as when the pressure was not specified (let's assume it was not at boiling point originally), it means the temperature is less than 100 degrees.\n4. According to the function logic:\n   - If temp < boiling_point, state = 'Liquid'.\n   - If temp == boiling_point, state = 'Transition'.\n   - If temp > boiling_point, state = 'Gas'.\n\nSince the temperature remains below the new boiling point of 100 degrees, the state will still be 'Liquid'.\n\nTherefore, adjusting the pressure to 1 atmosphere and keeping the temperature the same will indeed ensure the state is 'Liquid'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If the initial temperature was already 100 degrees or above, changing the pressure to 1 atmosphere would not necessarily make it 'Liquid'.\n\nGiven the information provided, without knowing the exact initial temperature, we cannot definitively say that the state will always be 'Liquid' just by adjusting the pressure to 1 atmosphere.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: We have a function `compute_values` that computes the state of a substance based on its temperature (`temp`) and pressure (`pressure`). The boiling point is calculated as `100 + (pressure - 1) * 0.5`.\n\n2. **Given Pressure**: The pressure is adjusted to 1 atmosphere.\n\n3. **Boiling Point Calculation**:\n   - When pressure is 1 atmosphere, the term `(pressure - 1)` becomes `0`.\n   - Therefore, the boiling point is `100 + 0 * 0.5 = 100`.\n\n4. **State Determination**:\n   - If the temperature (`temp`) is greater than the boiling point (100), the state is 'Gas'.\n   - If the temperature (`temp`) is equal to the boiling point (100), the state is 'Transition'.\n   - If the temperature (`temp`) is less than the boiling point (100), the state is 'Liquid'.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: For the state to be 'Liquid', the temperature must be less than 100 degrees when the pressure is 1 atmosphere.\n\nSince the problem does not specify the exact value of `temp`, but asks if adjusting the pressure to 1 atmosphere ensures the state is 'Liquid', we need to consider the condition where `temp < 100`. If `temp` is indeed less than 100, then the state would be 'Liquid'.
