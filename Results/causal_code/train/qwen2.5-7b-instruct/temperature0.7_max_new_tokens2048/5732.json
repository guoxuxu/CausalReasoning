For instance, changes in population density, behavior patterns, or other external factors not accounted for in this function could also result in a lower infection rate.\n\nGiven the information provided and the context of the question, we can conclude that a lower infection rate does suggest that preventative measures were effective, but it is not a guarantee in all possible scenarios.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
