    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `update_inventory` function takes two parameters: `stock` (which represents the inventory) and `transactions`.\n\n2.

If the item exists in `stock`, it adds the corresponding value from `transactions` to the existing value in `stock`.\n\n5. If the item does not exist in `stock`, it sets the value of that item in `stock` to the value from `transactions`.\n\n6.
