    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_sales_data` takes a single argument `data`, which is expected to be a dictionary.\n\n2. The first condition checks if `data['sales']` is greater than 100,000.\n   - If true, it sets `data['high_performer']` to True.\n   - If false, it sets `data['high_performer']` to False.\n\n3. The question specifically asks about the scenario where sales increase beyond 100,000.\n\n4. If the sales do indeed exceed 100,000, then the condition `data['sales'] > 100000` will evaluate to True.\n\n5. When this condition is True, the code inside the if block runs, setting `data['high_performer']` to True.\n\nTherefore, if the sales increase beyond 100,000, the 'high_performer' status will indeed be marked as True.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
