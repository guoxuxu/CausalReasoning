  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the activity level above 3 changes the initial condition where the risk was set to 'high' due to both age being over 50 and the activity level being below 3. The condition no longer holds with the activity level above 3, likely leading to a new assessment of risk level.",

  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in activity level reduces the risk level, while age and heart rate directly determine the risk level.",

    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1.

According to the function `compute_health_status`, with these values:\n   - The condition `if age > 50 and activity_level < 3` is true.\n   - Therefore, the risk level is set to 'high'.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the intervention:\n   - The activity level increases from 2 to 4.\n\n4. With the new activity level of 4:\n   - The condition `if age > 50 and activity_level < 3` becomes false because `activity_level` is no longer less than 3.\n   - We move to the next condition: `elif heart_rate > 100`\n     - This condition is also false since the heart rate is still 85.\n   - The last condition `else` sets the risk level to 'low'.\n\n5.
