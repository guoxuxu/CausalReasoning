    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` takes four parameters: `base_score`, `bonus`, `penalty`, and `high_score_bonus_enabled`.\n\n2. If `base_score > 90` and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`, the function adds 20 to the `bonus`.\n\n3. The `final_score` is calculated as `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n\n4. If `final_score > 100`, it is capped at 100.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `base_score > 90`:\n\n- If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`, the `bonus` will be increased by 20.\n- This means the `final_score` will be at least `base_score + 20 - penalty`.\n- If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `False`, the `bonus` remains unchanged, but we still need to check if the `final_score` increases.\n\nTo determine if the `final_score` necessarily increases when `base_score > 90`, we need to consider the worst-case scenario for `bonus` and `penalty`:\n\n- The worst case for increasing the `final_score` would be having the maximum possible negative impact from `penalty`. However, even with a large `penalty`, the initial increase of `20` (if `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`) can offset it, especially since `base_score` is already greater than 90.\n\nGiven that `base_score` is greater than 90, adding 20 to the `bonus` will always result in an increase unless the `penalty` is so large that it reduces the score below the original `base_score` value, which is not guaranteed to happen.\n\nTherefore, the `final_score` will necessarily increase when `base_score > 90` because the addition of 20 to the `bonus` ensures that the score will go up, even if the `penalty` is significant.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The function starts with `base_score`, `bonus`, and `penalty` as input parameters. `high_score_bonus_enabled` is a boolean that determines whether an additional 20 points can be added to the bonus.\n\n2. **Bonus Adjustment**:\n   - If `base_score > 90` and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`, then the bonus is increased by 20 points.\n   - Otherwise, the bonus remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Final Score Calculation**:\n   - The final score is calculated as `final_score = base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n   - If the result exceeds 100, it is capped at 100.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Question**:\n   - We need to determine if the final score will necessarily increase when `base_score > 90`.\n\n5. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - **Case 1**: `base_score > 90` and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`.\n     - In this case, the bonus increases by 20 points.\n     - The final score calculation becomes `base_score + (bonus + 20) - penalty`.\n     - Since the base score is already greater than 90, adding 20 to the bonus will generally increase the final score, unless the penalty is large enough to offset this increase.\n   - **Case 2**: `base_score > 90` and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `False`.\n     - Here, the bonus does not change.\n     - The final score calculation is simply `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n     - Again, since the base score is greater than 90, the final score will typically increase, unless the penalty is sufficiently high.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - In both cases where `base_score > 90`, the final score will generally increase due to the initial high base score.\n   - However, there is a theoretical possibility that the penalty could be so large that it offsets the increase in bonus, but this scenario is highly unlikely without specific values for `bonus` and `penalty`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the final score will likely increase, but there is a small possibility it might not increase under extreme conditions.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThis accounts for the rare scenario where the penalty is extremely high, which would negate the increase in bonus.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: We start with `base_score`, `bonus`, and `penalty` as input parameters. The key variable here is whether `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True or False.\n\n2. **Bonus Addition**: If `base_score > 90` AND `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True, then the `bonus` is increased by 20. This means that if these conditions are met, the score is effectively getting an additional 20 points.\n\n3. **Final Score Calculation**: The final score is calculated as `final_score = base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n\n4. **Clamp to 100**: If the `final_score` exceeds 100, it is clamped to 100. This means that even if the score increases due to the bonus, it cannot go above 100.\n\n5. **Question Analysis**: The question asks if the `final_score` will necessarily increase if `base_score` is greater than 90. \n\n   - If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is False, then the `bonus` remains unchanged, and thus the `final_score` might not increase if the `penalty` is sufficiently large.\n   - If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True, the `bonus` will increase by 20, which will definitely increase the `final_score` unless the `penalty` is so large that it cancels out the entire bonus (i.e., `penalty >= 20`).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The `final_score` will not necessarily increase because it depends on the value of `penalty`. If the `penalty` is very high, it can negate the effect of the bonus.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` takes four parameters:\n   - `base_score`: the initial score.\n   - `bonus`: an additional bonus to be added to the score.\n   - `penalty`: a penalty to be subtracted from the score.\n   - `high_score_bonus_enabled`: a boolean indicating whether a high-score bonus should be applied.\n\n2. If `base_score > 90` and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`, then the function adds 20 to the `bonus`.\n\n3. The `final_score` is calculated as:\n   ```\n   final_score = base_score + bonus - penalty\n   ```\n\n4. If `final_score` exceeds 100, it is capped at 100.\n\n5. We need to determine if the `final_score` will necessarily increase when `base_score > 90`.\n\n6. Let's consider the scenario where `base_score > 90`:\n   - If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `False`, the `bonus` remains unchanged, and the `final_score` is simply `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n   - If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`, the `bonus` increases by 20, making the `final_score` potentially higher due to the additional 20 points.\n\n7. However, the increase in `bonus` does not guarantee an increase in `final_score` because of the subtraction of `penalty`. If the `penalty` is large enough, it could offset the increase in `bonus`.\n\n8. To illustrate, let's use an example:\n   - Suppose `base_score = 95`, `bonus = 10`, `penalty = 30`, and `high_score_bonus_enabled = True`.\n   - Without the high-score bonus, the `final_score` would be `95 + 10 - 30 = 75`.\n   - With the high-score bonus, the `bonus` becomes `10 + 20 = 30`, so the `final_score` becomes `95 + 30 - 30 = 95`.\n   - In this case, the `final_score` did not increase.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the `final_score` does not necessarily increase when `base_score > 90`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",

If `base_score > 90` and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True:\n   - The function adds 20 to the `bonus`.\n\n3. Regardless of the `high_score_bonus_enabled` condition:\n   - The `final_score` is calculated as `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n\n4. If `final_score > 100`, it is capped at 100.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `base_score > 90`:\n\n- If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is False, the `bonus` remains unchanged, so the `final_score` might not increase compared to just using `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n- Even if `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True, the `final_score` could still be lower if the `penalty` is large enough to offset the addition of 20 to the `bonus`.\n\nFor example:\n- If `base_score = 95`, `bonus = 10`, `penalty = 30`, and `high_score_bonus_enabled = True`:\n  - Without the bonus, `final_score = 95 + 10 - 30 = 75`.\n  - With the bonus, `final_score = 95 + (10 + 20) - 30 = 105`, which is capped at 100.\n  - In this case, the final score does increase.\n- However, if `penalty = 45`:\n  - Final score would be `95 + (10 + 20) - 45 = 60`, which is less than the original `final_score` without the bonus.\n\nGiven these scenarios, we cannot definitively say that the `final_score` will necessarily increase when `base_score > 90`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"

However, this does not affect the initial increase check for `base_score > 90`.\n\nGiven that the bonus is only added when `base_score > 90` and the penalty can vary, the final score will only necessarily increase if the penalty is not large enough to offset the 20-point bonus.

If the penalty is large enough, it could potentially offset the added 20, making the final score lower or equal to what it would have been without the bonus.\n\nTo determine if the final score will necessarily increase, let's consider the worst-case scenario where the penalty is maximized:\n\n- Suppose `penalty` is very large (e.g., `penalty = base_score + 100`), which is a theoretical upper limit for demonstration purposes.\n- In this case, even though `bonus` is increased by 20, the penalty could be so large that the final score does not necessarily increase.\n\nFor example:\n- If `base_score = 95`, `bonus = 0`, and `penalty = 115`:\n  - Without the bonus, `final_score = 95 + 0 - 115 = -20`.\n  - With the bonus, `final_score = 95 + 20 - 115 = 0`.\n\nIn this case, the final score does not increase.\n\nTherefore, the final score does not necessarily increase when `base_score > 90`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
