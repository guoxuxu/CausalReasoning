    "Let's break down the function `compute_scores` step by step to understand how changes in `bonus_enabled` would affect `base_score`.\n\n1. **Base Score Calculation**: \n   - The base score is calculated as the average of all grades: `base_score = sum(grades) / len(grades)`.\n\n2. **Bonus Calculation**:\n   - If `bonus_enabled` is `True`, the maximum grade (`max(grades)`) is added to the base score.\n   - If `bonus_enabled` is `False`, no bonus is added to the base score.\n\n3. **Penalty Calculation**:\n   - If `penalty_enabled` is `True`, the minimum grade (`min(grades)`) is subtracted from the base score.\n   - If `penalty_enabled` is `False`, no penalty is applied to the base score.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `bonus_enabled` is changed from `False` to `True`:\n\n- Initially, when `bonus_enabled` is `False`, the base score is just the average of the grades: `base_score = sum(grades) / len(grades)`.\n- When `bonus_enabled` is set to `True`, the base score becomes: `base_score = (sum(grades) / len(grades)) + max(grades)`.\n\nGiven that the maximum grade (`max(grades)`) is always non-negative (assuming grades are non-negative), adding it to the base score will always result in an increase in the base score.\n\nTherefore, changing `bonus_enabled` from `False` to `True` will indeed increase the `base_score`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Base Score Calculation**:\n   - The initial `base_score` is calculated as the average of all grades.\n   - This is computed as `sum(grades) / len(grades)`.\n\n2. **Effect of Changing `bonus_enabled` to True**:\n   - When `bonus_enabled` is True, the function adds the maximum grade (`max(grades)`) to the `base_score`.\n   - This means the `base_score` will be adjusted to include the highest grade in the calculation.\n\n3. **Impact on `base_score`**:\n   - The addition of the maximum grade (which is generally higher than the average) will increase the `base_score` unless the maximum grade is equal to the current average.\n   - Even if the maximum grade is not higher than the average, it could still shift the overall average upwards, depending on the distribution of the grades.\n\n4. **Considering Different Scenarios**:\n   - If there is at least one grade that is higher than the initial average, adding the maximum grade will definitely increase the `base_score`.\n   - If all grades are the same, changing `bonus_enabled` to True won't change the `base_score` because the maximum grade would be the same as the average.\n   - However, since the problem doesn't specify that all grades are the same, we should consider the general case where at least one grade is different.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that in most cases, changing `bonus_enabled` from False to True will result in an increase in `base_score`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Base Score Calculation**: \n   - The initial base score is calculated as the average of all grades.\n   - This is done using `base_score = sum(grades) / len(grades)`.\n\n2. **Effect of Changing `bonus_enabled` to True**:\n   - When `bonus_enabled` is set to True, the function checks if it should add the maximum grade (`bonus`) to the base score.\n   - This means the new base score would be `base_score + bonus`, where `bonus` is the highest grade in the list.\n\n3. **Comparison of New vs Old Base Score**:\n   - Without any changes, the base score is just the average of all grades.\n   - With `bonus_enabled` set to True, the base score becomes the average plus the highest grade.\n   - Since the highest grade (max(grades)) is always greater than or equal to the average, adding it to the base score will always result in an increase.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, changing `bonus_enabled` from False to True will indeed cause `base_score` to increase.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
