    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `castVote` method increments the `totalVotes` by 1 each time it is called.\n2. The `getVotesForCandidate` method retrieves the number of votes for a specific candidate from the `votesPerCandidate` map.\n3. The `votesPerCandidate` map stores the number of votes for each candidate, which is updated every time `castVote` is called for that candidate.\n4. When `castVote` is called, it also updates the `votesPerCandidate` map to reflect the additional vote for the specified candidate.\n5. The `getVotesForCandidate` method simply returns the current value stored in the map for the given candidate.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that:\n\n- Incrementing `totalVotes` by 1 does not directly affect the values in the `votesPerCandidate` map.\n- The `getVotesForCandidate` method will always return the correct number of votes for a specific candidate based on the entries in the `votesPerCandidate` map, regardless of changes to `totalVotes`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The `getVotesForCandidate` method retrieves the number of votes for a specific candidate from the `votesPerCandidate` map. If the candidate hasn't been voted for yet, it defaults to 0.\n\n4. When a vote is cast using `castVote`, it directly updates the count for that specific candidate in the `votesPerCandidate` map, but it does not affect the overall `totalVotes` count for other candidates.\n\n5.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Methods**:\n   - `castVote(String candidate)`: This method increments the `totalVotes` by 1 and also increments the count for the specified candidate in the `votesPerCandidate` map.\n   - `getTotalVotes()`: Returns the current value of `totalVotes`.\n   - `getVotesForCandidate(String candidate)`: Returns the number of votes for the specified candidate from the `votesPerCandidate` map.\n\n2. **Effect of `castVote` on `getVotesForCandidate`**:\n   - When `castVote` is called with a candidate, it updates both `totalVotes` and the count for that candidate in the `votesPerCandidate` map.\n   - However, `getVotesForCandidate` only looks at the `votesPerCandidate` map to determine the vote count for a specific candidate. It does not depend on `totalVotes`.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The `castVote` method modifies the `totalVotes` and the vote count for the candidate, but these changes do not affect how `getVotesForCandidate` retrieves the vote count for a specific candidate. The method always returns the current count for that candidate as stored in the map.\n\nTherefore, incrementing `totalVotes` by 1 will not change the result of `getVotesForCandidate` for a specific candidate.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**:\n   - `PollSystem` has two main attributes: `totalVotes` and `votesPerCandidate`.\n   - `totalVotes` keeps track of the total number of votes cast.\n   - `votesPerCandidate` is a hashmap that maps each candidate to their respective vote count.\n\n2. **Method Analysis**:\n   - `castVote(String candidate)` increments `totalVotes` by 1 and updates the vote count for the specified candidate in `votesPerCandidate`.\n   - `getTotalVotes()` returns the current value of `totalVotes`.\n   - `getVotesForCandidate(String candidate)` returns the current vote count for the specified candidate from `votesPerCandidate`.\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `totalVotes` → `getTotalVotes`: The method `getTotalVotes` directly returns the value of `totalVotes`.\n   - `castVote` → `totalVotes`: Each call to `castVote` increments `totalVotes` by 1.\n   - `castVote` → `votesPerCandidate`: Each call to `castVote` updates the vote count for the specified candidate in `votesPerCandidate`.\n   - `votesPerCandidate` → `getVotesForCandidate`: The method `getVotesForCandidate` retrieves the vote count for a candidate from `votesPerCandidate`.\n\n4. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if incrementing `totalVotes` by 1 (through a call to `castVote`) changes the result of `getVotesForCandidate` for a specific candidate.\n\n5. **Reasoning**:\n   - When `castVote` is called, it increments `totalVotes` but does not modify the vote count for any candidate unless the candidate being voted for is specified.\n   - `getVotesForCandidate` retrieves the vote count for a specific candidate from `votesPerCandidate`, which is updated independently of `totalVotes`.\n   - Therefore, incrementing `totalVotes` by 1 through `castVote` does not affect the vote count for any specific candidate stored in `votesPerCandidate`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Incrementing `totalVotes`:**\n   - The method `castVote` increments `totalVotes` by 1.\n   - This is indicated by the line `totalVotes++;` within the `castVote` method.\n\n2. **Effect on `getTotalVotes`:**\n   - The method `getTotalVotes` simply returns the current value of `totalVotes`.\n   - Since `totalVotes` is incremented by `castVote`, calling `getTotalVotes` after a vote is cast will return a value that is 1 greater than it was before the vote was cast.\n\n3. **Effect on `votesPerCandidate`:**\n   - The method `castVote` also updates the `votesPerCandidate` map to reflect the number of votes each candidate has received.\n   - Specifically, `votesPerCandidate.put(candidate, votesPerCandidate.getOrDefault(candidate, 0) + 1);` increments the count for the given candidate.\n\n4. **Effect on `getVotesForCandidate`:**\n   - The method `getVotesForCandidate` retrieves the number of votes for a specific candidate from the `votesPerCandidate` map.\n   - If a candidate has been voted for, their count in `votesPerCandidate` will be incremented by `castVote`.\n\n5. **Relationship between `totalVotes` and `getVotesForCandidate`:**\n   - `totalVotes` is a cumulative count of all votes cast.\n   - `getVotesForCandidate` returns the specific count for a single candidate.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Incrementing `totalVotes` by 1 through `castVote` does not directly affect the value returned by `getVotesForCandidate`. `getVotesForCandidate` only reflects the count for a specific candidate, which is updated independently of the overall `totalVotes`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

It increases the count for the specified candidate by 1.\n\n4. **Impact on `getVotesForCandidate`**: When you call `getVotesForCandidate` with a specific candidate, it retrieves the value from the `votesPerCandidate` map. If the candidate was voted for, this value will have been incremented by 1 due to the `castVote` method.\n\n5. **Question Analysis**: The question asks if incrementing `totalVotes` by 1 changes the result of `getVotesForCandidate` for a specific candidate. From our analysis, we can see that `totalVotes` is incremented independently of `votesPerCandidate`. The `getVotesForCandidate` method directly accesses the `votesPerCandidate` map, which is updated based on the candidate being voted for, not the overall total votes.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is no, incrementing `totalVotes` by 1 does not directly change the result of `getVotesForCandidate` for a specific candidate.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
