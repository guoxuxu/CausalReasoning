    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Environment` class has an `__init__` method that sets the initial temperature to a random integer between -10 and 30 degrees Celsius.\n\n2. In the given code, an instance of `Environment` is created without any specific temperature being set explicitly.\n\n3. The `Heater` class has an `__init__` method that checks if the environment's temperature is less than 20 degrees Celsius. If it is, the heater becomes active.\n\n4. The `active` attribute of the `Heater` instance is set based on the initial temperature of the environment.\n\n5. We need to determine if the heater will be active when the environment's temperature is 15 degrees Celsius.\n\n6. Since 15 is indeed less than 20, the condition `self.environment.temperature < 20` will evaluate to True.\n\n7.

The `Heater` class has an `__init__` method that checks if the environment's temperature is less than 20 degrees Celsius to determine if it should be active.\n\n4.
