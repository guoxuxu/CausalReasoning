  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Increasing the age from 17 to 58 moves the age from the <18 category (base_score = 20) to the <60 category (base_score = 50), which results in an overall higher base score. The age criteria within the student bonus logic do not affect the output unless is_student or has_job states differ, therefore the answer assumes these are unchanged.",
  "causal_map": "age → base_score; age → bonus; is_student → bonus; has_job → bonus",
  "causal_map_integration": "An individual's age influences the base_score and bonus. The is_student status determines the bonus amount based on age, while having a job grants a fixed bonus regardless of age.",
