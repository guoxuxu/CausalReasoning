  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "In the provided code, turning on the heater increases the room temperature by 5 degrees. Since the window's status change leads to a temperature decrease when opened or remains unchanged if it's already closed, the increase in temperature when the window is closed clearly results from the heater being turned on.",
  "causal_map": "toggleHeaterStatus → roomTemperature; windowOpen → roomTemperature",
  "causal_map_integration": "Turning the heater on (toggleHeaterStatus) increases the room temperature. Similarly, opening the window (windowOpen) decreases the room temperature.",

Let's consider the effect of turning on the heater:\n   - `toggleHeaterStatus()` will change `heaterStatus` to true.\n   - This will cause `roomTemperature` to increase by 5 degrees.\n\n4.

Since the window is initially closed, the only way to increase the room temperature is by turning on the heater.\n\n6.
