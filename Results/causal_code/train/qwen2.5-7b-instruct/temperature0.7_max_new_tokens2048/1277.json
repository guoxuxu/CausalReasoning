    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `temperature` is set to 70.\n   - `acState` is initially false.\n   - `heaterState` is initially false.\n\n2. **Manually Setting `acState` to False**:\n   - This does not directly affect the `increaseTemperature()` method since it checks the current state of `acState` and `heaterState` within its logic.\n\n3. **Calling `increaseTemperature(int degrees)` with a Positive Degree**:\n   - The method checks two conditions:\n     - `!acState`: Since we manually set `acState` to false, this condition is satisfied.\n     - `degrees > 0`: If the input degrees are positive, this condition is also satisfied.\n\n4. **Effect on `heaterState`**:\n   - If both conditions are met, the method increments the temperature by the specified degrees.\n   - Crucially, the line `heaterState = true;` is executed, setting `heaterState` to true.\n\nTherefore, after manually setting `acState` to false and calling `increaseTemperature()` with a positive degree, `heaterState` will indeed be set to true.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

If both conditions are met, it increments the `temperature` by the specified `degrees`.\n4. Crucially, it then sets `heaterState` to `true`.\n\nGiven this logic, let's consider the scenario where `acState` is manually set to `false` and then `increaseTemperature()` is called with a positive degree:\n\n- Since `acState` is manually set to `false`, the first condition of the `if` statement in `increaseTemperature()` is satisfied.\n- The second condition (that `degrees` is greater than 0) is also likely to be satisfied when calling `increaseTemperature()`.\n- Therefore, the method will execute the block inside the `if` statement, which includes setting `heaterState` to `true`.\n\nThus, under these conditions, `heaterState` will indeed turn `true`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1.

We are asked what happens if we manually set `acState` to `false` and then call `increaseTemperature()` with a positive degree.\n\n4. Given that `acState` is now `false`, the first condition (`!acState`) will always be true when calling `increaseTemperature()`.\n\n5.
