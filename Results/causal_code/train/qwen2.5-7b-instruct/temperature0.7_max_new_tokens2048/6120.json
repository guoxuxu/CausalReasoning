  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "An increase in current temperature indeed occurs when the heatOn flag is true and heat is applied, increasing the temperature by 5. However, currentTemp can also increase because it was previously decreased by a large external temperature (over 100) and is now increasing less quickly (3 units decrease halted and plus 5 instead). Therefore, an increase in current temperature does not necessarily mean the external temperature was below 0.",

    "Let's analyze the code step by step to determine if we can infer that the external temperature was below 0 when the current temperature increases.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The `currentTemp` is updated based on the `externalTemp`.\n\n2. **Condition Checking**:\n   - If `externalTemp < 0`, then `heatOn` is set to `true`.\n   - If `externalTemp > 100`, then `heatOn` is set to `false`.\n\n3. **Temperature Update**:\n   - If `heatOn` is `true`, the `currentTemp` increases by 5.\n   - If `heatOn` is `false`, the `currentTemp` decreases by 3.\n\n4. **Inference**:\n   - For the `currentTemp` to increase, `heatOn` must be `true`.\n   - `heatOn` is `true` only if `externalTemp < 0`.\n\nTherefore, if the `currentTemp` increases, it implies that `heatOn` is `true`, which means `externalTemp < 0`.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `updateTemperature` method is called with an `externalTemp` value.\n2. If `externalTemp < 0`, then `heatOn` is set to true.\n3.

If `heatOn` is false, the current temperature decreases by 3.\n\nNow, let's consider what would cause the current temperature to increase:\n\n- For `heatOn` to be true, `externalTemp` must be less than 0.\n- In this case, the current temperature increases by 5.\n\nHowever, there's another way the current temperature could increase:\n- If `heatOn` is already true when the method is called, and `externalTemp` is between 0 and 100, the current temperature will still increase by 5.\n\nSo, just because the current temperature increased, it doesn't necessarily mean that the external temperature was below 0. It could have been any value between 0 and 100, as long as `heatOn` was already true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
