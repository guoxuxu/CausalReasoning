Since the discount percentage remains constant here regardless of the price increase, the final price will still increase proportionally with the initial price, assuming there are no changes in membership status or discount calculation.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discount` calculates the final price based on the original price and whether the customer is a member.\n\n2. If `is_member` is True:\n   - The discount is set to 0.1 (10%).\n   - The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - 0.1)`, which simplifies to `price * 0.9`.\n\n3. If `is_member` is False:\n   - The discount is set to 0.02 (2%).\n   - The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - 0.02)`, which simplifies to `price * 0.98`.\n\n4. In both cases, the final price is determined by multiplying the original price by a factor less than 1 (0.9 for members, 0.98 for non-members).\n\n5. Since both factors (0.9 and 0.98) are less than 1, raising the original price will always result in a higher final price.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n\nThe final price will not increase if the original price is raised; it will actually decrease because the final price is always a percentage of the original price (a percentage less than 100%).",

In both cases, the final price is a percentage of the original price (`price * 0.9` for members and `price * 0.98` for non-members).\n\n5. Both 0.9 and 0.98 are less than 1, meaning that regardless of whether the customer is a member or not, the final price will always be less than the original price.\n\n6. Therefore, raising the original price will result in a higher value being passed into the function, but due to the multiplication with a factor less than 1, the final price will actually decrease from its original value.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discount` calculates the final price based on whether the customer is a member or not.\n\n2. If `is_member` is True, the discount is 10% (0.1).\n3. If `is_member` is False, the discount is 2% (0.02).\n\n4. The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n\n5. To determine if the final price increases when the price of the item is raised, we need to consider how the formula behaves with different discounts.\n\n6. Let's take two scenarios:\n   - Scenario A: Original price = $100, is_member = True (10% discount)\n     Final price = $100 * (1 - 0.1) = $90\n   - Scenario B: New price = $200, is_member = True (10% discount)\n     New final price = $200 * (1 - 0.1) = $180\n\n7. Comparing Scenario A and B, we can see that when the price is doubled from $100 to $200, the final price also doubles from $90 to $180, assuming the same discount rate.\n\n8. This relationship holds true for any price increase, as long as the discount rate remains constant and the customer status (member/ non-member) does not change.\n\nTherefore, if the price of an item is raised, the final price in the function will also increase proportionally, assuming the customer status and discount rates remain unchanged.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the price of an item changes:\n\n5. If the original price increases, the term `price` in the formula `price * (1 - discount)` will also increase.\n6. Since the discount percentage (either 10% or 2%) remains constant regardless of the price, the reduction from the price due to the discount will also increase proportionally with the price.\n7. Therefore, if the price increases, the final price after applying the discount will also increase, but it will be a larger amount than the original final price due to the higher base price.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that if the price of an item is raised, the final price in the function will also increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discount` calculates the final price based on the input `price` and a boolean `is_member`.\n\n2.

To determine if raising the `price` will increase the `final_price`, we need to consider how the final price is computed relative to the price.\n\n5. The formula `final_price = price * (1 - discount)` shows that the final price is directly proportional to the price. This means that if the price increases, the term `price * (1 - discount)` will also increase, assuming the discount remains constant.\n\n6. However, the discount itself does not change with the price. It only depends on whether the customer is a member or not.\n\n7.
