    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The ShoppingCart class has an `applyDiscount` method that takes a discount code as input.\n\n2. In the `applyDiscount` method:\n   - If the code is 'SAVE20', it multiplies the total by 0.8 (which is equivalent to reducing it to 80%).\n\n3. The question specifically asks about applying the 'SAVE20' discount code.\n\n4. When 'SAVE20' is passed to the `applyDiscount` method:\n   - This line of code will be executed: `this.total *= 0.8;`\n\n5. Multiplying any number by 0.8 results in that number being reduced to 80% of its original value.\n\nTherefore, applying the 'SAVE20' discount code will indeed reduce the total price to 80% of its original value.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Multiplying a number by 0.8 is equivalent to reducing it to 80% of its original value.\n\nGiven these points, applying the 'SAVE20' discount code will indeed reduce the total price to 80% of its original value.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

In the `applyDiscount` method, there are two conditions:\n   - If the code is 'SAVE10', the total is multiplied by 0.9 (which means it becomes 90% of the original value).\n   - If the code is 'SAVE20', the total is multiplied by 0.8 (which means it becomes 80% of the original value).\n\n3.
