    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - The `data_handler` object is created with `data_config` set to `{'mode': 'test', 'verbose': True}`.\n   - The `send_data` method checks if `mode` is 'production'. Since it's not, it returns `False` without printing anything.\n\n2. **Changing Mode**:\n   - We change `data_handler.data_config['mode']` to 'production'.\n\n3. **Calling `receive_data`**:\n   - The `receive_data` method now checks two conditions:\n     1. If `mode` is 'production'.\n     2. If `verbose` is `True`.\n   - Both conditions are met (`mode` is 'production' and `verbose` is `True`).\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - Since both conditions are satisfied, it will print 'Data received'.\n\nGiven these steps, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Then, `data_handler.data_config['mode']` is explicitly changed to 'production'.\n4. Next, the `receive_data` method is called.\n5. In the `receive_data` method, two conditions are checked:\n   - `if self.data_config['mode'] == 'production'`: This condition is now `True` because we explicitly changed `mode` to 'production'.\n   - `and self.data_config['verbose']`: This condition is also `True` because `verbose` is still `True`.\n\nSince both conditions are met (`mode` is 'production' and `verbose` is `True`), the method will print 'Data received'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
