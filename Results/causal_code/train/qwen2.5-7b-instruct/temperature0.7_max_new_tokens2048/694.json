    "Let's break down the code and analyze it step by step to determine if John's performance rating automatically increases when his salary is manually adjusted.\n\n1. **Initialization of John**:\n   - `john` is an instance of the `Employee` class with a performance rating of 85 and a salary of 50000.\n\n2. **Review Performance Function**:\n   - This function takes an `employee` object as input.\n   - If the `performanceRating` is greater than 80, it increases the rating by 5 and updates the salary by 10%.\n   - If the `performanceRating` is 80 or less, it increases the rating by 2.\n   - The updated rating is then capped at 100 using `Math.min`.\n\n3. **Reviewing John's Performance**:\n   - Since John's initial performance rating is 85, which is greater than 80, the function will increase his rating by 5.\n   - His new performance rating becomes 90.\n   - His salary will be increased by 10%, so his new salary is 55000.\n\n4. **Manual Salary Adjustment**:\n   - The problem statement mentions \"manually adjusting John's salary upwards.\" This means changing his salary to a value higher than 55000 without calling the `updateSalary` method or the `reviewPerformance` function.\n\n5. **Effect on Performance Rating**:\n   - The performance rating is only updated within the `reviewPerformance` function based on certain conditions (specifically, if the current rating is above 80).\n   - Manually adjusting the salary does not trigger any changes to the performance rating unless the `reviewPerformance` function is called again.\n\nGiven that the manual adjustment of salary does not inherently call the `reviewPerformance` function, the performance rating will not automatically increase just because the salary is adjusted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the code and analyze it step by step to determine if John's performance rating automatically increases when his salary is adjusted.\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - John is created as an instance of `Employee` with a performance rating of 85 and a salary of 50,000.\n   \n2. **Review Performance Function**:\n   - This function checks the current performance rating.\n   - If the performance rating is greater than 80, it increases the rating by 5 and updates the salary by 10%.\n   - If the performance rating is 80 or less, it increases the rating by 2.\n   - The updated rating is capped at 100 using `Math.min`.\n\n3. **Updating Salary**:\n   - The `updateSalary` method increases the current salary by 10% of its current value.\n\n4. **Reviewing John**:\n   - Since John's initial performance rating is 85, which is greater than 80, the function will increase his rating by 5, making it 90.\n   - It then calls `updateSalary` with a 10% increase, which means his salary will go up by 10%, but this does not directly affect the performance rating.\n\nThe key point here is that the performance rating is updated based on the condition in the `reviewPerformance` function, and this function is called only when reviewing performance. Adjusting John's salary manually does not trigger the `reviewPerformance` function, nor does it change the performance rating.\n\nTherefore, manually adjusting John's salary upwards does not cause his performance rating to automatically increase.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We have an `Employee` class with properties for `name`, `performanceRating`, and `salary`.\n   - The `updateSalary` method increases the salary by a percentage.\n   - The `reviewPerformance` function updates the performance rating based on the current rating and optionally increases the salary.\n\n2. **Review Performance Function**:\n   - If the employee's performance rating is greater than 80, it increases by 5 points and the salary is increased by 10%.\n   - If the employee's performance rating is 80 or less, it increases by 2 points.\n   - The new rating is then capped at 100 using `Math.min`.\n\n3. **Applying to John**:\n   - John starts with a performance rating of 85 and a salary of 50,000.\n   - Since his performance rating is greater than 80, it increases by 5 points to 90.\n   - His salary is then increased by 10%, from 50,000 to 55,000.\n\n4. **Question Analysis**:\n   - The question asks if manually adjusting John's salary would cause his performance rating to increase automatically.\n   - From the code, we see that the performance rating is only updated as part of the `reviewPerformance` function, which is triggered by the performance rating itself being checked.\n   - There is no mechanism in the provided code where adjusting the salary directly affects the performance rating.\n\nBased on this analysis, the performance rating does not automatically increase just because the salary is adjusted manually.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Class Definition**: The `Employee` class is defined with a constructor that initializes an employee with a name, performance rating, and salary. It also has a method `updateSalary` to adjust the salary based on a percentage increase.\n\n2. **John's Initialization**: An instance of `Employee` named `john` is created with the name 'John Doe', a performance rating of 85, and a salary of 50,000.\n\n3. **Review Performance Function**:\n   - This function takes an `employee` as an argument.\n   - If the employee's performance rating is greater than 80, it increases the performance rating by 5 points and updates the salary by 10%.\n   - Otherwise, it increases the performance rating by 2 points.\n   - The new performance rating is capped at 100 using `Math.min`.\n\n4. **Applying the Review Performance Function to John**:\n   - Since John's initial performance rating is 85 (which is greater than 80), the function will increase his performance rating by 5 points to 90.\n   - Additionally, it will update his salary by 10%.\n\n5. **Manual Salary Adjustment**:\n   - The question asks if manually adjusting John's salary upwards causes his performance rating to automatically increase.\n   - However, the `reviewPerformance` function only adjusts the performance rating based on the existing performance rating and does not consider any manual salary adjustments.\n   - Manual salary adjustments do not trigger the performance rating update mechanism in the `reviewPerformance` function.\n\nTherefore, manually adjusting John's salary upwards does not automatically increase his performance rating.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the code and the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Class Definition**: The `Employee` class is defined with properties `name`, `performanceRating`, and `salary`.
