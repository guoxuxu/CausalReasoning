    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `adjust_temperature` method takes a `change` parameter.\n2. If the current temperature plus the change would exceed 100, it sets the temperature to 100.\n3. If the current temperature plus the change would drop below 0, it sets the temperature to 0.\n4. Otherwise, it simply adds the change to the current temperature.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we pass a positive value for `change`:\n- If the current temperature is already at 100, adding any positive value would make it exceed 100, so it would be capped at 100.\n- If the current temperature is below 100 but above 0, adding a positive value will indeed increase the temperature.\n- If the current temperature is 0, adding a positive value will increase it.\n\nHowever, the key point is that even if the temperature starts at 100, a positive `change` value will not increase it further. It will remain at 100.\n\nTherefore, the temperature attribute will not always increase when a positive change is passed to the `adjust_temperature` method. It will only increase if it's not already at its maximum (100).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `adjust_temperature` method takes a `change` parameter.\n2. If `self.temperature + change` results in a value greater than 100, the temperature is set to 100.\n3. If `self.temperature + change` results in a value less than 0, the temperature is set to 0.\n4. If neither of the above conditions are met (i.e., the new temperature falls within the valid range [0, 100]), then the temperature is increased by `change`.\n\nGiven that we are specifically considering a positive `change` value:\n\n- If the current temperature (`self.temperature`) plus the positive `change` would result in a value greater than 100, the temperature will be capped at 100.\n- If the current temperature plus the positive `change` would result in a value less than or equal to 100, the temperature will indeed increase.\n\nTherefore, while the temperature will not exceed 100 due to the cap, it does not necessarily mean it will always increase when a positive change is applied. It can stay the same if it would exceed 100 without the cap.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
