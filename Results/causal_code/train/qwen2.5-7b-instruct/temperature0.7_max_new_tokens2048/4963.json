  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Setting the temperature to 4 using setTemperature causes the temperature to fall below 5, triggering the condition inside setTemperature to set isRaining to true.",
  "causal_map": "temperature → isRaining; setTemperature → temperature; setTemperature → isRaining; artificialRain → temperature; artificialRain → isRaining",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting the temperature to 4 degrees using setTemperature will cause it to start raining because when the temperature is less than 5, isRaining becomes true. Additionally, calling artificialRain sets isRaining to true and decreases the temperature by 3.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `setTemperature` method is called with a new temperature of 4 degrees.\n2.
