    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Car` class has an attribute `engine_status` initialized to 'off' in its constructor (`__init__`).\n\n2. The `start_engine` method sets `engine_status` to 'on'.\n\n3. There is no other method provided in the class that would change the `engine_status` to 'on'.\n\n4. If the `engine_status` is 'on', it must have been set to that value by one of the methods in the class.\n\n5. Given the only method that can set `engine_status` to 'on' is `start_engine`, we can conclude that if `engine_status` is 'on', then `start_engine` must have been called at some point.\n\n6. However, the question asks specifically about whether the `start_engine` method was invoked, not if it could have been invoked.\n\n7. It's possible for `engine_status` to be 'on' due to other external factors not covered in the provided code (e.g., manual intervention outside the class).\n\n8. Since we cannot definitively say that `start_engine` was the method that changed `engine_status` to 'on' based solely on the information provided, we cannot conclusively state \"yes\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

But based solely on the information given, we can't be 100% certain about other possible invocations.\n\nHowever, since the problem specifically states `my_car.start_engine()`, and we are asked to determine if the engine status being 'on' implies that `start_engine` was invoked, the direct answer is yes.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

After calling `start_engine`, we check if `my_car.engine_status == 'on'`.\n\nGiven these points, let's reason further:\n\n- When `my_car.start_engine()` is called, the method directly sets `my_car.engine_status` to 'on'.\n- If `my_car.engine_status` is 'on', it means the `start_engine` method was indeed called at some point because it is the only method that changes `engine_status` to 'on'.\n\nTherefore, if `my_car.engine_status` is 'on', it implies that the `start_engine` method was invoked.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
