    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `process_data` function calculates several new columns for the input DataFrame `data`.\n2. The `risk_factor` is calculated as `age_squared * 0.05 + smoker * 2`.\n3. If `risk_factor` is greater than 5, then `insurance_premium` is set to 2000.\n4. Otherwise, `insurance_premium` is set to 1200.\n\nNow, let's consider when `insurance_premium` is 2000:\n\n- For `insurance_premium` to be 2000, `risk_factor` must be greater than 5.\n- The formula for `risk_factor` is `age_squared * 0.05 + smoker * 2`.\n\nTo have `risk_factor` > 5, at least one of the following conditions must be true:\n- `age_squared * 0.05` is sufficiently large (greater than 5 - 2 = 3)\n- `smoker * 2` is equal to 2 (which means `smoker` is 1, indicating the individual is a smoker)\n\nHowever, having `age_squared * 0.05` greater than 3 does not necessarily mean that `smoker` is 1. There could be other combinations of `age` and `smoker` values that satisfy `risk_factor > 5`.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclusively determine whether the individual is a smoker just from knowing that the `insurance_premium` is 2000.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `process_data` function calculates several values based on the input data.\n2. It computes `age_squared` as `age` squared.\n3. It then calculates `risk_factor` using the formula: `age_squared * 0.05 + smoker * 2`.\n4. If `risk_factor` is greater than 5, it sets `insurance_premium` to 2000; otherwise, it sets it to 1200.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition where the `insurance_premium` is 2000:\n\n- For the `insurance_premium` to be 2000, the `risk_factor` must be greater than 5.\n- The `risk_factor` is calculated as `age_squared * 0.05 + smoker * 2`.\n\nFor the `risk_factor` to exceed 5, the term `smoker * 2` plays a significant role because `age_squared * 0.05` would generally be much smaller for typical age ranges (e.g., 20-80 years).\n\nGiven that `smoker * 2` directly adds to the `risk_factor`, if `smoker` is 1 (indicating the individual is a smoker), the minimum value of `smoker * 2` is 2. This means even with a very low `age_squared * 0.05`, the sum could still easily exceed 5.\n\nHowever, if `smoker` is 0 (indicating the individual is not a smoker), the `risk_factor` would be solely dependent on `age_squared * 0.05`. In most cases, this alone would not typically exceed 5 unless the `age` is quite high.\n\nTherefore, while being a smoker increases the likelihood of the `risk_factor` exceeding 5, it is not the only factor. However, given the condition that the `insurance_premium` is 2000, which requires the `risk_factor` to be greater than 5, we can reasonably conclude that the individual is likely a smoker, but we cannot definitively conclude it without further information.\n\nBased on the provided logic and conditions, we can reasonably infer that if the `insurance_premium` is 2000, the individual is more likely to be a smoker, but we cannot conclusively state this without additional context.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` calculates several new columns based on existing data:\n   - `age_squared`: This is simply the square of the 'age' column.\n   - `risk_factor`: This is calculated as `age_squared * 0.05 + smoker * 2`.\n   - `insurance_premium`: Based on the value of `risk_factor`, it assigns either 2000 or 1200 to this column.\n\n2. We need to determine if an `insurance_premium` of 2000 necessarily means the individual is a smoker.\n\n3. For the `insurance_premium` to be 2000, the `risk_factor` must be greater than 5:\n   - If `risk_factor` > 5, then `insurance_premium` = 2000.\n   - If `risk_factor` <= 5, then `insurance_premium` = 1200.\n\n4. Now, let's look at how `risk_factor` is calculated:\n   - `risk_factor` = `age_squared * 0.05 + smoker * 2`\n   - For `risk_factor` to be greater than 5, the term `smoker * 2` must contribute significantly because `age_squared * 0.05` is relatively small (it depends on age but will generally be less than 1 for most practical ages).\n\n5. If `smoker` is 0 (not a smoker), then `risk_factor` would be at most `age_squared * 0.05`, which is unlikely to exceed 5 for any reasonable age.\n\n6. Therefore, for `risk_factor` to be greater than 5, `smoker` must be 1 (the individual must be a smoker).\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that if the insurance premium is 2000, the individual must be a smoker.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` calculates an 'insurance_premium' based on two factors: 'age_squared' and 'smoker'.\n\n2. 'age_squared' is calculated as the square of the age of the individual.\n\n3. 'risk_factor' is then calculated as:\n   - 0.05 * 'age_squared'\n   - Plus 2 if the individual is a smoker (i.e., 'smoker' is 1)\n   - Plus 0 if the individual is not a smoker (i.e., 'smoker' is 0)\n\n4. If 'risk_factor' is greater than 5, the 'insurance_premium' is set to 2000.\n   Otherwise, it is set to 1200.\n\n5. We need to determine if an 'insurance_premium' of 2000 necessarily means the individual is a smoker.\n\n6. For 'insurance_premium' to be 2000, 'risk_factor' must be greater than 5.\n\n7. Let's consider the contribution of each factor to 'risk_factor':\n   - '0.05 * age_squared' will vary depending on age but is generally small for typical human ages.\n   - 'smoker * 2' contributes 2 if the individual is a smoker and 0 if not.\n\n8. To get 'risk_factor' > 5, even if '0.05 * age_squared' is very low, adding 2 from being a smoker could push 'risk_factor' over 5.\n\n9. However, there are scenarios where 'risk_factor' could still be > 5 without the individual being a smoker:\n   - If '0.05 * age_squared' is large enough (e.g., for very old individuals), it might exceed 5 on its own.\n\nTherefore, knowing that 'insurance_premium' is 2000 does not conclusively prove that the individual is a smoker.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `age` of the individual is squared to create `age_squared`.\n2. The `risk_factor` is calculated as `age_squared * 0.05 + smoker * 2`.\n3. If `risk_factor` is greater than 5, then `insurance_premium` is set to 2000.\n4.
