    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `WeatherSimulator` class simulates weather conditions.\n2.

The `updateWeather()` method determines whether it's raining based on the temperature:\n   - If temperature < 20, it sets isRainy to true.\n   - Otherwise, it sets isRainy to false.\n\n4. The `bringUmbrella()` method checks if it's raining and updates the umbrella state accordingly:\n   - If it's raining (isRainy == true), it sets umbrellaOpens to true.\n   - Otherwise, it sets umbrellaOpens to false.\n\n5.

Looking at the current implementation, there is no way to change the weather (make it rain) by opening the umbrella.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `WeatherSimulator` class has two key states:\n   - `isRainy`: Whether it is currently raining.\n   - `umbrellaOpens`: Whether the umbrella is open.\n\n2. The relationship between these states is defined as:\n   - `isRainy → umbrellaOpens`: If it is raining, the umbrella will open automatically.\n   - `temperature → isRainy`: The temperature determines whether it is raining (if temperature < 20, it rains).\n\n3. The method `bringUmbrella()` is only called when the weather simulator detects rain. It does not allow manual opening of the umbrella.\n\n4. The method `isUmbrellaOpen()` returns the state of the umbrella, which is determined by `bringUmbrella()`, but this method is only called if it is raining.\n\n5.
