    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Initially, the room temperature is set to 20 and the heater is off.\n2. We intentionally turn off the heater by setting `heaterOn` to false. This does not change the temperature directly but sets the condition for the `decreaseTemp()` method.\n3. When we call `decreaseTemp()`, it checks if the heater is on:\n   - Since we just turned it off, the condition `if (heaterOn)` evaluates to false.\n4. Because the heater is off, the method proceeds to decrease the temperature by 3.\n5. The initial temperature was 20, so after decreasing by 3, the new temperature becomes 17.\n\nTherefore, after intentionally turning off the heater and calling `decreaseTemp()`, the temperature will indeed be exactly 17.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
