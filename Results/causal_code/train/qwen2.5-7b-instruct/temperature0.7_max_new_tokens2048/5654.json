    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `WeatherSystem` class has two key properties:\n   - `temperature`: an integer representing the current temperature.\n   - `isRaining`: a boolean indicating whether it is currently raining.\n\n2. There are two methods in this class:\n   - `changeWeather(int tempChange)`: This method changes the temperature by adding `tempChange` to it. If the new temperature is less than 0, it sets `isRaining` to `false`.\n   - `startRain()`: This method sets `isRaining` to `true` only if the current temperature is greater than 5.\n\n3. We start with the system in a non-raining state. This means `isRaining` is `false`.\n\n4. We then manually invoke `startRain()`.\n\n5.
