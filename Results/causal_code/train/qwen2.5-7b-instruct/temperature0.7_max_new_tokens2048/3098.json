    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The `weather_condition` function randomly selects one of three weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. The `affect_on_traffic` function determines how the traffic will be based on the weather:\n   - If it's 'rainy', the traffic will be 'heavy'.\n   - If it's 'cloudy', the traffic will be 'moderate'.\n   - If it's 'sunny', the traffic will be 'light'.\n\n3. Given that the weather today is set to be 'sunny' (as per the code provided), we can directly refer to the logic in the `affect_on_traffic` function.\n\n4. According to the function, when the weather is 'sunny', the traffic will be 'light'.\n\nTherefore, if the weather is sunny, the traffic will indeed be light.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the code step by step to determine if the traffic will be light when the weather is sunny.\n\n1. **weather_condition()**: This function returns one of three possible weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'. \n\n2. **decide_to_carry_umbrella(weather)**: \n   - If the weather is 'rainy', it will always return `True` (meaning you should carry an umbrella).\n   - If the weather is 'cloudy', it randomly decides whether to carry an umbrella (`True` or `False`).\n   - If the weather is 'sunny', it will return `False` (meaning you don't need to carry an umbrella).\n\n3. **affect_on_traffic(weather)**:\n   - If the weather is 'rainy', it returns 'heavy' traffic.\n   - If the weather is 'cloudy', it returns 'moderate' traffic.\n   - If the weather is 'sunny', it returns 'light' traffic.\n\nGiven that we are specifically asked about the case where the weather is sunny, let's look at the relevant part of the code:\n\n```python\ndef affect_on_traffic(weather):\n  if weather == 'rainy':\n    return 'heavy'\n  elif weather == 'cloudy':\n    return 'moderate'\n  else:\n    return 'light'\n```\n\nWhen the weather is 'sunny', the `else` block is executed, which returns 'light'.\n\nTherefore, if the weather is sunny, the traffic will indeed be light.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The `affect_on_traffic()` function has an `if` statement that checks if the weather is 'rainy'. Since it's not 'rainy', it moves to the next condition.\n\n4. There is no further `elif` for 'cloudy' either, so it will execute the `else` block.\n\n5.
