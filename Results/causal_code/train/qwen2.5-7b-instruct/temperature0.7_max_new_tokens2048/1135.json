    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `getWeatherStatus` method returns either 1 or 0 randomly.\n2. If the weather is 1:\n   - `calculateTraffic` returns 100 + a random number between 0 and 49.\n   - This means the possible traffic levels range from 100 to 149.\n3. If the weather is 0:\n   - `calculateTraffic` returns 50 + a random number between 0 and 29.\n   - This means the possible traffic levels range from 50 to 79.\n\n4. Given a specific traffic level of 70:\n   - 70 falls within the range that could be produced when the weather is 0 (50-79).\n   - However, it does not fall within the range that could be produced when the weather is 1 (100-149).\n\n5. Since 70 is only possible with weather 0, we can determine the prior weather status was 0.\n\nTherefore, based on the given traffic level of 70, we can indeed determine the exact prior weather status.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `getWeatherStatus()` method returns either 1 or 0 based on a random condition:\n   - If Math.random() > 0.5, it returns 1 (good weather)\n   - Otherwise, it returns 0 (bad weather)\n\n2. The `calculateTraffic()` method uses the weather status to determine the traffic level:\n   - For good weather (weather == 1):\n     - Base traffic is 100\n     - Adds a random value between 0 and 50 (inclusive)\n   - For bad weather (weather == 0):\n     - Base traffic is 50\n     - Adds a random value between 0 and 29 (inclusive)\n\n3. Given an observed traffic level of 70, we need to determine if we can pinpoint the exact prior weather status.\n\n4. Let's consider both scenarios:\n   - Good weather: Traffic level would be between 100 and 150 (100 + [0-50])\n   - Bad weather: Traffic level would be between 50 and 79 (50 + [0-29])\n\n5. An observed traffic level of 70 falls within the range for both good and bad weather:\n   - It could be the result of good weather with a low random addition (100 + 0 - 30)\n   - Or it could be the result of bad weather with a high random addition (50 + 20)\n\n6. Since there are overlapping ranges, we cannot definitively determine the exact prior weather status from a single observed traffic level.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `getWeatherStatus()` method returns either 1 or 0 with equal probability (50% each).\n\n2. If the weather is 1:\n   - The traffic is calculated as 100 + a random number between 0 and 49.\n   - This means traffic levels can range from 100 to 149.\n\n3. If the weather is 0:\n   - The traffic is calculated as 50 + a random number between 0 and 29.\n   - This means traffic levels can range from 50 to 79.\n\n4. We observe a specific traffic level of 70.\n\n5. Since 70 falls within the range of possible traffic levels when the weather is 0 (50-79), it could have resulted from either weather condition.\n\n6. However, there's no way to distinguish between these two scenarios based solely on the observed traffic level.\n\nTherefore, given an observed traffic level of 70, we cannot determine the exact prior weather status.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `getWeatherStatus` method randomly returns either 0 or 1.\n2. If the weather is 1 (good weather):\n   - The traffic level is calculated as 100 + a random number between 0 and 49.\n   - This means the traffic level could be any value from 100 to 149.\n3. If the weather is 0 (bad weather):\n   - The traffic level is calculated as 50 + a random number between 0 and 29.\n   - This means the traffic level could be any value from 50 to 79.\n\nGiven that we observed a specific traffic level of 70:\n- 70 falls within the range of possible traffic levels for both good and bad weather conditions.\n- Specifically, 70 could be due to:\n  - Good weather (100 + a negative or zero random number, which isn't possible since the minimum is 100).\n  - Bad weather (50 + a random number, where the random number would be 20).\n\nSince 70 is within the range of possible outcomes for bad weather but not for good weather, we can conclude that the weather must have been bad when this traffic level was observed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
