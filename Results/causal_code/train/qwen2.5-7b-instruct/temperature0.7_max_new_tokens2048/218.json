    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. It checks if the key 'age' exists in the dictionary.\n3. If 'age' exists, it sets a new key 'is_adult' to True if the age is 18 or older, otherwise False.\n4. Then, based on the value of 'is_adult':\n   - If 'is_adult' is True (which means age is 18 or older), it sets 'status' to 'adult'.\n   - If 'is_adult' is False (which means age is younger than 18), it sets 'status' to 'minor'.\n5. The function returns the updated dictionary.\n\nGiven this logic:\n- If the 'status' of a user is 'minor', it directly means that the condition for setting 'status' to 'minor' was met.\n- According to the code, this condition is met when 'is_adult' is False, which happens only when the age is less than 18.\n\nTherefore, if the 'status' of a user is 'minor', we can deduce that the user's 'age' is indeed less than 18.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

We need to determine if 'status' being 'minor' implies that 'age' is less than 18.\n\n5. From the logic in the function, we can see that:\n   - A user is marked as 'minor' only when their 'is_adult' flag is False.\n   - 'is_adult' is False only when the user's age is less than 18.\n\nTherefore, if the 'status' of a user is 'minor', we can indeed deduce that the user's 'age' is less than 18.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
