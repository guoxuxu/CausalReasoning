  "Explanation": "A high performance boost could be a direct result of an intervention that adjusts how performance boost is calculated in relation to class attendance. Therefore, observing a high performance boost does not necessarily indicate actual high attendance without knowing if any interventions (e.g., changes in performance calculation) took place.",

Therefore, for the `performance_boost` to be significantly higher (i.e., 0.1), the `class_attendance` must be greater than 75.\n\n7.

    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: We start with an `initial_grade` of 70.\n2. **Function Parameters**: The function `student_grades` takes three parameters: `hours_studied`, `class_attendance`, and `current_grade`.\n3. **Performance Boost**: If `class_attendance > 75`, then `performance_boost = 0.1`.
