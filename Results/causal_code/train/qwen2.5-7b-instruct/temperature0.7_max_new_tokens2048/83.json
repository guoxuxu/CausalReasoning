  "Explanation": "Based on the `activity_feedback` function, the feedback rating for a picnic (activity corresponding to sunny weather) is 8, which is higher than the rating for watching movies (5). By intervening to set the weather consistently sunny, the consequent activity is always a picnic, effectively ensuring a higher feedback rating.",
