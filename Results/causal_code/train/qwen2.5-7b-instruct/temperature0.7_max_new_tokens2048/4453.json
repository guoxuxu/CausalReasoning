Alice has:\n   - Sales of 120 (which is greater than 100)\n   - Years of service of 4 (which is greater than 3)\n4. Therefore, under the original criteria, Alice would be promoted.\n\nNow let's consider the new criteria:\n- The new criterion requires more than 5 years of service regardless of sales.\n\n5. Alice has 4 years of service, which does not meet the new requirement of more than 5 years.\n\nTherefore, under the new criteria, Alice will **not** be promoted.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
