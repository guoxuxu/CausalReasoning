  "Explanation": "By intervening and modifying the heat application to increase the temperature by 10 instead of 5 when heatOn is true, you directly enhance the effect of the cause (external temperature dropping below 0 causes heatOn to become true). Thus, the rate at which the current temperature increases will be higher.",
