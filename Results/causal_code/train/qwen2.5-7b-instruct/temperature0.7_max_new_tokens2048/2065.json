    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `ShoppingCart` class is initialized with an empty list of items.\n2. The `add_item` method appends the given price to the `items` list.\n3. The `calculate_total` method checks if the `items` list is empty:\n   - If it is empty, it returns 0.\n   - Otherwise, it calculates the total and applies a discount if applicable.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where no items are added to the shopping cart:\n\n4. If no items are added, the `items` list remains empty.\n5. When calling `calculate_total`, the condition `if not self.items:` will evaluate to True because the list is indeed empty.\n6. As per the code, when the list is empty, the method returns 0.\n\nTherefore, if no items are added to the shopping cart, the total price will indeed be zero.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `ShoppingCart` class is initialized with an empty list of items.\n\n2. **Adding Items**: \n   - `shop_cart.add_item(50)` adds the first item priced at $50.\n   - `shop_cart.add_item(80)` adds the second item priced at $80.\n   \n3. **Applying Discount Code**:\n   - The `apply_discount_code` method is called with the discount code 'SAVE20'.\n   - This method applies an 80% discount to all items in the cart, effectively multiplying each item's price by 0.8.\n\n4. **Calculating Total**:\n   - The `calculate_total` method is called to compute the final total.\n   - It checks if there are any items in the cart using `if not self.items`.\n   - Since items have been added (50 and 80), this condition is false.\n   - It then calculates the total price after applying the discount.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where no items are added to the cart:\n\n- If no items are added, the `items` list would remain empty (`[]`).\n- In this case, when `calculate_total` is called, the condition `if not self.items` would evaluate to `True`.\n- Therefore, the function would return `0`, indicating that the total price is zero.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer to the question \"If no items are added to the shopping cart, will the total price be zero?\" is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ShoppingCart` class is initialized with an empty list of items.\n2. The `add_item` method appends the given price to the `items` list.\n3. The `calculate_total` method first checks if the `items` list is empty:\n   - If it is, it returns 0 immediately.\n   - Otherwise, it calculates the total and applies a discount if the sum of all items exceeds 100.\n\n4. In the provided code snippet:\n   - Two items (50 and 80) are added to the cart.\n   - A discount code 'SAVE20' is applied, which changes the prices to 80% of their original value.\n   - Finally, the `calculate_total` method is called.\n\n5. Since items are indeed added to the cart, the `if not self.items` condition in `calculate_total` will not be met, and the calculation will proceed.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the scenario where **no items** are added to the shopping cart.\n\n6. If no items are added, the `items` list will remain empty when `calculate_total` is called.\n7. The `if not self.items` condition will then evaluate to `True`.\n8.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ShoppingCart` class is defined with an `__init__` method that initializes an empty list `items`.\n\n2. The `add_item` method appends an item price to the `items` list.\n\n3. The `calculate_total` method:\n   - Checks if `items` is empty. If it is, it returns 0.\n   - Otherwise, it calculates the total sum of the items.\n   - Applies a 10% discount if the total sum is greater than 100.\n   - Returns the total after applying any discount.\n\n4. The `apply_discount_code` method applies a specific discount code ('SAVE20') which reduces each item price by 20%.\n\n5. In the given code snippet:\n   - Two items (50 and 80) are added to the shopping cart.\n   - The 'SAVE20' discount code is applied.\n   - The `calculate_total` method is called to get the final total.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where no items are added to the shopping cart:\n\n- If no items are added, `self.items` would remain an empty list `[]`.\n- When `calculate_total` is called, the first condition checks `if not self.items`, which evaluates to `True` because `self.items` is indeed empty.\n- Therefore, the method returns 0 immediately without calculating any sum or applying any discounts.\n\nBased on this reasoning, if no items are added to the shopping cart, the total price will be zero.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

This changes all item prices to 80% of their original value.\n4. **Calculating Total**: The `calculate_total` method is called to compute the total.\n\nNow, let's analyze the `calculate_total` method:\n\n- If there are no items in the cart (`self.items` is empty), it returns 0.\n- If there are items, it checks if the sum of the items exceeds 100 to determine if a discount should be applied.\n- If the sum exceeds 100, a 10% discount is applied.\n- If the sum does not exceed 100, no discount is applied.\n- The `apply_discount_code` method changes the prices to 80% of their original value, but this does not affect whether the sum exceeds 100 or not.\n\nGiven that two items were added (50 and 80), the sum is 130, which is greater than 100. Therefore, a 10% discount would be applied, but the question specifically asks about the scenario where no items are added.\n\nIf no items are added, the `self.items` list will be empty, and the `calculate_total` method will directly return 0 without any further calculations.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
