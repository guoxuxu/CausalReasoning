  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Seeing the order value doubled does not conclusively indicate that the user is a member, because increasing the quantity without being a member could also increase the order value. Other factors like a non-member placing a larger order could result in increased order value, hence membership cannot be inferred directly without additional information on the quantity ordered.",
  "causal_map": "isMember → orderValue; orderValue → doubled",
  "causal_map_integration": "If a user is a member (isMember), then the order value is doubled (orderValue → doubled); the order value being doubled (doubled) indicates that the user is a member (orderValue → isMember)",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `processOrder` takes two parameters:\n   - `quantity`: an integer representing the order quantity.\n   - `isMember`: a boolean indicating whether the user is a member.\n\n2. If `isMember` is true (the user is a member):\n   - The function returns `quantity * 2`, meaning the order value is doubled.\n\n3.

Based on the logic of the function:\n   - The only way for the order value to be doubled is if `isMember` is true.\n\n6.

    "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `processOrder` takes two parameters:\n   - `quantity`: An integer representing the number of items ordered.\n   - `isMember`: A boolean indicating whether the user is a member.\n\n2. The function checks if `isMember` is true:\n   - If true, it returns `quantity * 2`.\n   - If false, it returns `quantity`.\n\n3.

Doubling the order value can only happen if `isMember` is true, as per the logic in the function.\n\n5.

The function `processOrder` takes two parameters:\n   - `quantity`: An integer representing the initial quantity of items ordered.\n   - `isMember`: A boolean indicating whether the user is a member.\n\n2. If `isMember` is true (the user is a member), the function returns `quantity * 2`, meaning the order value is doubled.\n\n3.

    "Let's break down the function `processOrder`:\n\n1.
