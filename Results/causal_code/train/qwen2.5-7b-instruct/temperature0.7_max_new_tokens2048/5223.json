    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have an `OnlineShop` class with methods to manage products and the cart total.\n\n2. The `addProduct` method takes a price as an argument and adds it to the `products` array. It also calls `updateCartTotal()` to recalculate the total.\n\n3. The `updateCartTotal` method uses the `reduce` function to sum up all the prices in the `products` array and sets `cartTotal` to this sum.\n\n4. If we call `addProduct(100)`, it will:\n   - Add 100 to the `products` array.\n   - Call `updateCartTotal()` which will sum up all the prices in the array.\n\n5. Since we're adding a single product priced at 100, the `reduce` function will simply return 100 when called on `[100]`.\n\nTherefore, after adding a product with a price of $100, the `cartTotal` will indeed increase by $100.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

If we add a product with a price of $100 using `addProduct(100)`, this price will be pushed into the `products` array.\n5.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `OnlineShop` class is defined with methods to manage products and the cart total.\n2. The `addProduct` method adds a product (given by its price) to the `products` array and then calls `updateCartTotal`.\n3. The `updateCartTotal` method calculates the sum of all prices in the `products` array and assigns it to `cartTotal`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we add a product with a price of $100:\n\n4. When `addProduct(100)` is called:\n   - The price of $100 is pushed into the `products` array.\n   - The `updateCartTotal` method is called immediately after.\n\n5. In the `updateCartTotal` method:\n   - It uses the `reduce` function to sum up all elements in the `products` array.\n   - Initially, there were no elements in the array, so the initial accumulator (`acc`) is set to 0.\n   - The first element (the newly added $100) is added to 0, resulting in an updated `cartTotal` of $100.\n\nTherefore, adding a product with a price of $100 will indeed increase the `cartTotal` from 0 to $100.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `OnlineShop` class has an `addProduct` method that adds a price to the `products` array.\n2.

As a result, the `updateCartTotal` method will include this new price in its calculation.\n\nTherefore, when a product with a price of $100 is added, the cartTotal will indeed increase by $100.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
