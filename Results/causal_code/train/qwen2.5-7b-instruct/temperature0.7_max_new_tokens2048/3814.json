    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a class `WeatherForecast` with two private fields:\n   - `temperature`: an integer representing the current temperature.\n   - `isStormy`: a boolean indicating whether it is stormy.\n\n2. The constructor `WeatherForecast(int temperature, boolean storm)` initializes these fields based on the provided values.\n\n3. There's a method `willItRain()` that checks if the conditions for rain are met:\n   - If the temperature is less than 20 degrees Celsius AND it is stormy, then it returns `true`.\n   - Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n4. Given the problem statement, we need to determine if the `willItRain()` method would return `true` when the temperature is set to 15 degrees Celsius and it is stormy.\n\n5. Let's check the condition in the `willItRain()` method:\n   - Temperature is 15 degrees Celsius (which is less than 20).\n   - It is stormy (which is true).\n\n6. Since both conditions (temperature < 20 and isStormy being true) are satisfied, the method should return `true`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We have a class `WeatherForecast` with two private attributes:\n   - `temperature` of type `int`\n   - `isStormy` of type `boolean`\n\n2. The constructor `WeatherForecast(int temperature, boolean storm)` initializes these attributes.\n\n3. The method `willItRain()` checks if the temperature is less than 20 degrees Celsius AND it is stormy. If both conditions are met, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\n4. The method `increaseTemperature(int increment)` increases the temperature by the specified amount.\n\n5. Now, let's consider the scenario where the temperature is set to 15 degrees Celsius and it is stormy.\n\n6. According to the `willItRain()` method logic:\n   - The condition `this.temperature < 20` is true because 15 is indeed less than 20.\n   - The condition `this.isStormy` is also true because it is stormy.\n\n7. Since both conditions are true, the method will return `true`.\n\nTherefore, if the temperature is set to 15 degrees Celsius and it is stormy, the `WeatherForecast` will indicate rain.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The constructor sets these values when an object is created.\n\n3. There's a method `willItRain()` that checks if it will rain based on the current temperature and whether it is stormy.\n\n4. The logic in `willItRain()` is as follows:\n   - If the temperature is less than 20 AND it is stormy, it returns true (indicating rain).\n   - Otherwise, it returns false (indicating no rain).\n\n5. We need to check if the WeatherForecast will indicate rain when the temperature is set to 15 degrees Celsius and it is stormy.\n\n6. Let's plug in the values:\n   - Temperature = 15 (which is less than 20)\n   - Is Stormy = true\n\n7.
