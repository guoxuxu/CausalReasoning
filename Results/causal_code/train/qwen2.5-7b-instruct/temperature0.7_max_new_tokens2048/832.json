    "Let's break down the logic of the `increaseTemp()` method to understand when and how the reaction rate changes.\n\n1. The method `increaseTemp()` increments the temperature (`temp`) by 5.\n2. If the new temperature (`temp + 5`) is greater than 100:\n   - The reaction rate (`reactionRate`) is doubled.\n3. Otherwise, the reaction rate is increased by 10.\n\nThe key point here is that the condition for doubling the reaction rate is based on the **new** value of `temp` after it has been incremented by 5. It does not depend on whether the current `temp` is already above 100.\n\nGiven this, we can conclude that if the temperature goes above 100 during the increment (i.e., if the new value of `temp` is greater than 100), the reaction rate will indeed double.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `increaseTemp` method to determine if the reaction rate will necessarily double when the temperature goes above 100.\n\n1. The method `increaseTemp` increments the temperature by 5.\n2. If the new temperature is greater than 100, it multiplies the reaction rate by 2.\n3. If the new temperature is not greater than 100, it adds 10 to the reaction rate.\n\nThe key point here is that the condition for doubling the reaction rate is solely based on whether the new temperature after incrementing by 5 is greater than 100. \n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the temperature goes above 100:\n- If the temperature is exactly 100, increasing it by 5 will make it 105, which is greater than 100, so the reaction rate will double.\n- If the temperature is less than 100 but very close to it (say 99), increasing it by 5 will make it 104, which is also greater than 100, so the reaction rate will double.\n- If the temperature is already above 100 (say 101), increasing it by 5 will make it 106, which is still greater than 100, so the reaction rate will double.\n\nIn all these scenarios, if the temperature goes above 100, the reaction rate will indeed double.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

This means that the temperature can reach 101 or higher without necessarily doubling the reaction rate immediately.\n5. For example, if the initial temperature is 95:\n   - First call to `increaseTemp`: temp becomes 100, reactionRate += 10\n   - Second call to `increaseTemp`: temp becomes 105, reactionRate *= 2\n6.

There's no method that can reduce the temperature below 100 once it has gone above 100.\n\nGiven these points:\n- The temperature can go above 100 if we call `increaseTemp()` enough times.\n- Once the temperature is above 100, the `reactionRate` will be doubled.\n- However, there's no guarantee that the temperature will stay above 100 indefinitely.\n- The `decreaseReaction()` method could potentially bring the temperature back below 100, which would prevent further doubling of the reaction rate.\n\nTherefore, while the reaction rate will definitely double when the temperature first goes above 100, it does not necessarily remain doubled for all subsequent calls to `increaseTemp()`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
