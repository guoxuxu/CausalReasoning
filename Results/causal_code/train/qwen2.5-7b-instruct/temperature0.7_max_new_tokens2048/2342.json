    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `increase_production` takes two parameters:\n   - `cost_increase`: An integer representing the increase in production costs.\n   - `demand_rising`: A boolean indicating whether demand is rising.\n\n2. If `demand_rising` is True:\n   - The production units are calculated as `100 + cost_increase`.\n\n3. If `demand_rising` is False:\n   - The production units are calculated as `50 + cost_increase // 2`. Here, `//` denotes integer division.\n\n4. We need to determine if we can adjust `cost_increase` to verify if the observed increase in `production_units` was due to `demand_rising`.\n\n5. Let's consider the possible scenarios:\n   - If `demand_rising` is True, increasing `cost_increase` will always result in a higher production unit count (since it's added directly).\n   - If `demand_rising` is False, increasing `cost_increase` will also generally result in a higher production unit count, but the effect is less pronounced due to the integer division.\n\n6. However, there's no way to distinguish between these two cases solely based on the change in `production_units` and `cost_increase`. This is because:\n   - For both True and False cases, increasing `cost_increase` will increase `production_units`.\n   - There's no unique value of `cost_increase` that would give us different results for True and False.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot uniquely determine whether the increase in `production_units` was due to `demand_rising` just by adjusting `cost_increase`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
