    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_net_income` takes two parameters: `revenue` and `expenses`.\n2. It calculates net income as `revenue - expenses`.\n3.

If the net income is not greater than zero (i.e., it could be zero or negative), it prints \"Loss: $<net_income>\".\n\nThe key point here is that net income is defined as revenue minus expenses. Therefore, for the net income to be greater than zero, the following must be true:\n\n\\[ \\text{Net Income} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Expenses} > 0 \\]\n\nRearranging this inequality gives us:\n\n\\[ \\text{Revenue} > \\text{Expenses} \\]\n\nThus, if the net income is greater than zero, it indeed implies that revenue was higher than expenses.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**:\n   - The `calculate_net_income` function takes two parameters: `revenue` and `expenses`.\n   - It calculates the `net_income` as `revenue - expenses`.\n\n2. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `revenue → net_income`: This means that `revenue` directly affects `net_income`. If `revenue` increases while `expenses` remain constant, `net_income` will increase.\n   - `expenses → net_income`: Similarly, `expenses` also directly affect `net_income`. If `expenses` increase while `revenue` remains constant, `net_income` will decrease.\n\n3. **Condition for Positive Net Income**:\n   - The function checks if `net_income > 0`.\n   - For `net_income` to be greater than zero, the condition `revenue - expenses > 0` must be true.\n   - This simplifies to `revenue > expenses`.\n\n4. **Given Scenario**:\n   - In the provided code, `revenue = 1000` and `expenses = 500`.\n   - Plugging these values into the formula: `net_income = 1000 - 500 = 500`, which is indeed greater than zero.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the function logic and the given values, if the net income is greater than zero, it implies that the revenue was higher than the expenses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
