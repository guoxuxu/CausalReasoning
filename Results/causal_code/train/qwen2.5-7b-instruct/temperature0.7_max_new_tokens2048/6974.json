    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The `weather_condition()` function randomly selects one of three weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `weather_condition` function determines the weather as either 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2.

The `productivity` function takes the mood as input and generates a random number of work done based on the mood:\n   - Happy -> 8-10 units of work done\n   - Sad -> 4-6 units of work done\n   - Neutral -> 6-8 units of work done\n\n4. If the weather is sunny, it leads to a happy mood.\n\n5. A happy mood results in a higher range of work done (8-10 units) compared to the other moods.\n\nTherefore, given that sunny weather leads to a happy mood, which in turn can result in a higher productivity score (8-10 units), we can conclude that if the weather is sunny, the productivity score is likely to be higher.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
