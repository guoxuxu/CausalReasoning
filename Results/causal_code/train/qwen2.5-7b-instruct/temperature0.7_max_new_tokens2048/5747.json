    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes two parameters: `data` and `flag`.\n2. If `flag` is True, it multiplies `data` by 2.\n3. If `flag` is False, it adds 100 to `data`.\n\nIn this specific case, we are asked about the scenario where `action_flag` (which corresponds to `flag` in `process_data`) is set to True.\n\nGiven that:\n- `flag` is True,\n- We need to check if `result` can be greater than 200 when `data_point` is greater than 100.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1.

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding `process_data` function**:\n   - If `flag` (action_flag) is `True`, the result is `data * 2`.\n   - If `flag` is `False`, the result is `data + 100`.\n\n2. **Understanding `final_result` function**:\n   - The `intermediate` value is obtained from `process_data`.\n   - If `intermediate` is greater than 150, the output is 'High'.\n   - Otherwise, the output is 'Low'.\n\n3. **Given condition**:\n   - We need to determine if the `result` can be greater than 200 when `action_flag` is `True` and `data_point` is greater than 100.\n\n4. **Analyzing the scenario**:\n   - When `action_flag` is `True`, `process_data` returns `data * 2`.\n   - For `data_point` values greater than 100, the minimum value of `data * 2` would be more than 200 (since 101 * 2 = 202).\n\nTherefore, if `data_point` is greater than 100 and `action_flag` is `True`, the `result` (which is `data * 2`) will indeed be greater than 200.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
