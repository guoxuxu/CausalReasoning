  "Question Type": "from effect to cause with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "No, because intervening and changing the mood to 'happy' disrupts the direct causal chain from weather to mood to activity. Before the intervention, reading typically suggests a 'gloomy' mood, primarily linked to rainy weather, but this causal linkage is broken by the intervention.",
  "causal_map": "weather → mood; mood → activity",
  "causal_map_integration": "The weather influences the mood, which in turn influences the chosen activity. Setting the mood to 'happy' manually does not provide enough information to infer the original weather, as the mood could have been 'happy' regardless of the weather.",
