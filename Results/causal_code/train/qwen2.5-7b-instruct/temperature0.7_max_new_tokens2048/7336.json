    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `checkIfSlippery` method returns true if both conditions are met:\n   - It is raining (`isRaining` is true)\n   - The temperature is 0 or below (`temperature <= 0`)\n\n2. If the roads are observed to be not slippery, the `checkIfSlippery` method must have returned false.\n\n3. For the `checkIfSlippery` method to return false, at least one of the following must be true:\n   - It is not raining (`isRaining` is false)\n   - The temperature is above 0 (`temperature > 0`)\n\n4. Therefore, if the roads are not slippery, it means that either it is not raining or the temperature is above 0 (or both).\n\n5.
