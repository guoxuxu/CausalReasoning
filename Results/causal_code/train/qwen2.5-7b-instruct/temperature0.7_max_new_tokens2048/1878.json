    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's examine the methods of the VehicleSystem class:\n   - `turnOnEngine()` sets `isEngineOn` to true and increases speed to 10.\n   - `drive()` only runs if `isEngineOn` is true and decreases fuel level while increasing speed further.\n   - `turnOffEngine()` sets `isEngineOn` to false and resets speed to 0.\n\n2. Now, let's consider the condition where 'speed' is more than 0:\n   - If the engine were off, the vehicle would not be able to move (speed would remain at 0).\n   - The only way for the speed to be greater than 0 is if the `drive()` method has been called, which requires `isEngineOn` to be true.\n\n3. Therefore, if the speed is greater than 0, it must mean that the engine is currently on.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the initial state of the VehicleSystem:\n   - `isEngineOn` starts as false\n   - `speed` starts at 0\n\n2. For the speed to be greater than 0, we need to analyze when this can happen based on the methods provided:\n\n3. The `drive()` method increases the speed by 20 if the engine is on and there is enough fuel.\n   - This means for speed to be greater than 0, the engine must be turned on (`isEngineOn` must be true).\n\n4. However, the `turnOnEngine()` method sets `isEngineOn` to true only if there is fuel (`fuelLevel > 0`).\n   - So, turning on the engine also requires sufficient fuel.\n\n5. But even if the engine is turned on, the speed will not increase until the `drive()` method is called, which happens after turning on the engine.\n\n6. Therefore, for the speed to be greater than 0, the engine must have been turned on and then the `drive()` method must have been called.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that if the speed is greater than 0, it does imply that the engine is currently on. However, it doesn't necessarily mean the engine was just turned on; it could have been on for some time and the speed has been increasing.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand how the speed and engine state are related in the VehicleSystem class.\n\n2. The `turnOnEngine` method sets `isEngineOn` to true and sets `speed` to 10 when there's enough fuel.\n\n3. The `drive` method only runs if `isEngineOn` is true. When it does run, it decreases the fuel level and increases the speed by 20.\n\n4. However, the `drive` method doesn't explicitly set `speed` to 0 when the engine is turned off. It only sets `isEngineOn` to false.\n\n5. This means that after driving, the speed could still be greater than 0 even if the engine is turned off, as long as it was above 0 at the time of turning off.\n\n6. Conversely, if the engine is turned on, the speed will be increased by 20 every time the `drive` method is called.\n\n7. Therefore, having a non-zero speed does not necessarily imply that the engine is currently on. The speed could have been set previously and the engine could have been turned off since then.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the relationships**:\n   - `isEngineOn → speed`: This means that when the engine is on (`isEngineOn` is true), the vehicle can have a non-zero speed.\n   - `fuelLevel → isEngineOn`: This indicates that the engine can only be turned on if there is some fuel (`fuelLevel > 0`).\n\n2. **Analyzing the conditions for turning on the engine**:\n   - The `turnOnEngine` method checks if `this.fuelLevel > 0` before setting `this.isEngineOn = true`.\n   - Once the engine is turned on, it sets `this.speed = 10`.\n\n3. **Considering the scenario where `speed` is more than 0**:\n   - If `speed` is more than 0, it implies that the engine is currently running because the `drive` method increases the speed by 20 each time it is called, and it requires the engine to be on.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the engine must be on for the vehicle to have a non-zero speed, and the speed being more than 0 directly indicates that the engine is on, we can conclude that if `speed` is more than 0, the engine is indeed currently on.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

The `turnOffEngine` method stops the engine and resets the speed to 0.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the relationship between `speed` and `isEngineOn`:\n\n- When the engine is turned on, the speed can be greater than 0 because the `drive` method increases the speed by 20 when the engine is on.\n- However, just because the speed is greater than 0 does not necessarily mean the engine is on. The speed could be greater than 0 due to previous driving actions or if the engine was on but then turned off and the speed hasn't been reduced yet.\n\nTo confirm, we need to consider the possible states:\n- If the engine is on, the speed will increase.\n- If the engine is off, the speed will stay at its last value or decrease if it was set to 0.\n\nSince the speed being greater than 0 doesn't guarantee that the engine is currently on, the answer is \"No\".\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

If true, it sets `isEngineOn` to `true` and increases `speed` to `10`.\n   - This means that for the engine to be turned on, there must be some fuel present (`fuelLevel > 0`).\n\n3. **Driving**:\n   - The method `drive()` only executes if `isEngineOn` is `true`.
