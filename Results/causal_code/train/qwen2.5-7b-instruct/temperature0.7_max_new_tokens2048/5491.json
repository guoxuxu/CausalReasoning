    "Let's break down the logic of the `willRainLater` method:\n\n1. The method checks if the current temperature is less than 20 degrees (`this.temperature < 20`).\n2. It also checks if it is currently raining (`this.rainy`).\n\nThe condition for returning `true` (indicating it will rain later) is that both of these conditions must be met:\n- The temperature must be less than 20.\n- It must be currently raining.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the temperature is set to below 20 degrees and it was not raining (`this.rainy == false`).\n\nGiven these conditions:\n- The first part of the `if` statement (`this.temperature < 20`) would be true.\n- However, the second part (`this.rainy`) would be false.\n\nSince both conditions need to be true for the method to return `true`, and one of them is false, the method will return `false`.\n\nTherefore, if the temperature is set to below 20 degrees and it was not raining, it will not rain later.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
