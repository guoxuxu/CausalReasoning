    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `RetailStore` class has an `apply_discount` method that sets the `discount` attribute to the provided percentage.\n\n2. In the `apply_discount` method, it checks if the stock is greater than 0, which it is (since we start with 100).\n\n3. If the condition is true, it calls the `increase_sales` method.\n\n4. The `increase_sales` method checks if the discount is greater than 20.\n\n5. If the discount is indeed greater than 20, it increases the sales by 10.\n   - If not, it increases the sales by 5.\n\n6. Now, let's consider the scenario where the discount is manually set to 30%.\n\n7. When `apply_discount(30)` is called, the `discount` attribute is set to 30.\n\n8. Since the stock is greater than 0, `increase_sales` is called.\n\n9. In `increase_sales`, since the discount (30) is greater than 20, the sales will be increased by 10.\n\nTherefore, if the discount percentage is manually set to 30%, the sales will definitely increase by 10.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
