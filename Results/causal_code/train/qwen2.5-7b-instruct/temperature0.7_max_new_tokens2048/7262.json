    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Methods**:\n   - `addItem(double price)`: Increases both `itemCount` and `totalPrice`.\n   - `applyDiscount(double discountRate)`: Reduces `totalPrice` by applying a discount rate.\n   - `removeItem(double price)`: Decreases `itemCount` and `totalPrice` by removing an item of a specified price.\n\n2. **Conditions for Reducing `totalPrice`**:\n   - `removeItem(double price)` directly reduces `totalPrice`.\n   - `applyDiscount(double discountRate)` also reduces `totalPrice`.\n\n3. **Question Analysis**:\n   - The question asks if reducing `totalPrice` always implies that `removeItem` was called.\n\n4. **Possible Scenarios**:\n   - If `removeItem` is called, `totalPrice` will definitely be reduced.\n   - However, `totalPrice` can also be reduced by calling `applyDiscount`, which does not involve calling `removeItem`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Reducing `totalPrice` could be due to either `removeItem` or `applyDiscount`.
