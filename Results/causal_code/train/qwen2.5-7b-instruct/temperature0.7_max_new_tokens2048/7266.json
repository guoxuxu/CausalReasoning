    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `adjust_temp` method increases the temperature by `change` and then clamps it between 18 and 25 degrees.\n\n2. If the final temperature after adjustment is 25 degrees, it means the temperature was adjusted to its maximum allowed value of 25.\n\n3. For the temperature to be adjusted to 25, it must have been greater than or equal to 22 before the adjustment (since the adjustment could be at most +3 degrees).\n\n4. If the initial temperature was exactly 22, it would be adjusted to 25 because the method allows for an increase up to 25.\n\n5. Therefore, the original temperature could have been 22 or higher, but not lower than 22.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot conclusively say that the original temperature was strictly higher than 22 degrees; it could have been exactly 22 degrees.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `adjust_temp` method adjusts the temperature by adding a specified change to the current temperature.\n2. If the resulting temperature would exceed 25 degrees, it is capped at 25 degrees.\n3. We know the final temperature after adjustment is 25 degrees.\n4. For the temperature to be adjusted and capped at 25 degrees, the original temperature must have been less than or equal to 25 degrees but greater than 25 - (25 - 18) = 18 degrees, because the minimum allowed temperature is 18 degrees.\n5. However, we need to consider the upper limit as well. The maximum allowed temperature is 25 degrees.\n6. Therefore, for the temperature to be adjusted and capped at 25 degrees, the original temperature must have been between 18 and 25 degrees (inclusive).\n7. Given that the final temperature is exactly 25 degrees, the original temperature could have been 25 degrees, 24 degrees, 23 degrees, or 22 degrees.\n\nSince the original temperature could have been 22 degrees, we cannot conclusively say that it was originally higher than 22 degrees.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `adjust_temp` method increases or decreases the temperature but ensures it stays within the range of 18 to 25 degrees.\n2. We know the final temperature after adjustment is 25 degrees.\n3. For the temperature to be adjusted to exactly 25 degrees, the original temperature must have been less than 25 degrees because:\n   - If the original temperature was already 25 or more, no adjustment would have been made.\n   - If the original temperature was between 18 and 24 (inclusive), it could be adjusted up to 25.\n4. Therefore, the original temperature must have been less than 25 degrees.\n5. However, we need to determine if it was specifically higher than 22 degrees.\n\n6. Considering the possible adjustments:\n   - If the original temperature was 24 degrees, it could be adjusted down to 25.\n   - If the original temperature was 23 degrees, it could be adjusted down to 25.\n   - If the original temperature was 22 degrees, it could also be adjusted down to 25.\n   - Any temperature below 22 degrees would not be adjusted to 25.\n\n7. Since we don't have specific information about the exact adjustment that led to 25 degrees, we cannot conclusively say that the original temperature was higher than 22 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `adjust_temp` method adjusts the temperature based on the `change` parameter.\n2. If the new temperature after adjustment would be greater than 25, it's capped at 25.\n3. If the new temperature would be less than 18, it's set to 18.\n4. We know the final temperature is 25.\n\nNow, let's consider what could have happened:\n\n- If the original temperature was 22 or higher, and the change was positive (increasing the temperature), the final temperature could indeed be 25.\n- However, if the original temperature was 22 or higher and the change was negative (decreasing the temperature), the final temperature would be lower than 25, not 25.\n- If the original temperature was below 22, the temperature could not have been adjusted to 25 because the minimum allowed temperature is 18.\n\nGiven these points, we cannot conclusively say that the original temperature was higher than 22 degrees before adjustment, as it could have been exactly 22 or lower.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The method `adjust_temp` only allows the temperature to be set to a maximum of 25 degrees.\n2. If the final temperature after adjustment is 25 degrees, it means the temperature was adjusted to this value.\n3. For the temperature to be adjusted to 25 degrees, it must have been above 25 degrees before the adjustment.\n4. If the temperature was exactly 25 degrees before adjustment, it would not have been adjusted at all.\n5. Therefore, for the temperature to end up at 25 degrees, it must have been higher than 25 degrees initially, which is not possible according to the rules of the `adjust_temp` method.\n6. Thus, the only logical conclusion is that the original temperature must have been between 18 (the minimum allowed) and 25 degrees, but not 25 itself.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot conclude that the original temperature was higher than 22 degrees before the adjustment. It could have been 24, 23, or even 22, but not higher.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
