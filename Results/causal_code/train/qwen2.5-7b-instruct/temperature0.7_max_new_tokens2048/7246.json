    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditions for `willSnow()`**:\n   - The method `willSnow()` returns `true` if the temperature is below 32 degrees (`temperature < 32`) and it is raining (`isRaining`).\n\n2. **Conditions for `currentWeather()`**:\n   - If both the temperature is below 32 degrees and it is raining, then `currentWeather()` returns \"Snowy\".\n   - If only it is raining, then `currentWeather()` returns \"Rainy\".\n   - Otherwise, `currentWeather()` returns \"Clear\".\n\n3. **Given Information**:\n   - The `currentWeather()` method returns \"Snowy\".\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - For `currentWeather()` to return \"Snowy\", both conditions must be met:\n     - The temperature must be below 32 degrees.\n     - It must be raining.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the `currentWeather()` method returned \"Snowy\", it confirms that the temperature is indeed below 32 degrees.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the methods defined in the `WeatherSystem` class, if the `currentWeather()` method indicates \"Snowy\", we can conclude that the temperature is below 32 degrees.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The `currentWeather()` method returns \"Snowy\" under two conditions:\n   - Temperature is below 32 degrees (`temperature < 32`) AND it is raining (`isRaining`)\n   - OR, it only checks for these two conditions and returns \"Snowy\" if both are true.\n\n3. The question asks if we can conclude that the temperature is below 32 degrees when the WeatherSystem indicates it is Snowy.\n\n4. From the `currentWeather()` method, we see that it returns \"Snowy\" only if both conditions (temperature < 32 and isRaining) are true.\n\n5.
