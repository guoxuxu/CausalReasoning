    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes an input `data`.\n2. It multiplies the input by 2, so `modified_data = data * 2`.\n3. If `modified_data > 100`, the function returns `True`.\n4. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nGiven:\n- `input_data = 60`\n- We need to determine if `output` being `False` means `input_data` was less than or equal to 50.\n\nFirst, let's calculate what would happen with `input_data = 60`:\n- `modified_data = 60 * 2 = 120`\n- Since `120 > 100`, the function would return `True`.\n\nHowever, we're told that `output` is `False`. This means that for `input_data`, `modified_data <= 100`.\n\nFor `modified_data` to be `<= 100`, `data * 2` must be `<= 100`.\n- Therefore, `data <= 50`.\n\nSo, if `output` is `False`, it means `input_data` must have been less than or equal to 50.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes an input `data` and doubles it.\n2. If the doubled value is greater than 100, it returns `True`.\n3. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nGiven:\n- `input_data = 60`\n- `output = process_data(input_data)`\n\nLet's see what happens with `input_data = 60`:\n1. `modified_data = data * 2 = 60 * 2 = 120`\n2. Since `120 > 100`, the function returns `True`.\n\nHowever, the question states that `output` is observed as `False`. This means the condition `modified_data > 100` did not hold true.\n\nFor `output` to be `False`, the condition must be:\n\\[ \\text{modified\\_data} \\leq 100 \\]\n\nThis implies:\n\\[ 2 \\times \\text{input\\_data} \\leq 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{input\\_data} \\leq 50 \\]\n\nTherefore, if `output` is observed as `False`, we can indeed conclude that `input_data` was less than or equal to 50.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes an input `data` and multiplies it by 2.\n2.

If it's not, the function returns `False`.\n\nGiven that the output is observed as `False`, let's consider what this means:\n\n5. For the function to return `False`, the condition `modified_data > 100` must be false.\n6. This means `modified_data <= 100`.\n7. Since `modified_data` is `data * 2`, we have `data * 2 <= 100`.\n8. Dividing both sides by 2 gives us `data <= 50`.\n\nTherefore, if the output is `False`, we can conclude that `input_data` was indeed less than or equal to 50.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
