    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have a `TrafficSystem` class with three attributes:\n   - `isRushHour`: a boolean indicating whether it's rush hour.\n   - `trafficDensity`: an integer representing the traffic density.\n   - `waitTime`: an integer representing the wait time.\n\n2. The constructor sets the initial values based on whether it's rush hour or not:\n   - If `isRushHour` is true, `trafficDensity` is set to 100 and `waitTime` is set to 30.\n   - If `isRushHour` is false, `trafficDensity` is set to 20 and `waitTime` is set to 5.\n\n3.
