According to the `prepare_for_activity` function, books are only prepared when the activity is 'library visit'. The 'library visit' activity is determined by the weather being 'cloudy'.

The key point here is that preparing for a library visit (which requires books) does not necessarily mean the weather was cloudy. The library visit could also be chosen if the weather was rainy, as there's no condition that explicitly prevents an indoor activity when it's raining.\n\n5. However, preparing for a library visit does indicate that the chosen activity is a library visit, which means the weather must have been either cloudy or rainy. Since we're specifically asked if preparing 'books' indicates the weather was 'cloudy', we need to consider both possible scenarios where books are required.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the preparation for books does not exclusively indicate cloudy weather, as it could also be due to rainy weather. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

We need to determine if preparing 'books' indicates that the weather was 'cloudy'.\n\n5.
