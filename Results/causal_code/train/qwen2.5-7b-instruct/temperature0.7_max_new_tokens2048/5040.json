    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `determine_weather_condition` method of the `WeatherSimulation` class checks several conditions to decide the weather type based on the temperature and humidity levels.\n\n2. One of the conditions specified in the method is:\n   ```python\n   elif self.temperature < 0:\n       return 'Snowy'\n   ```\n\n3. This condition directly states that if the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius, the weather condition will be 'Snowy'.\n\n4. Therefore, if the weather condition is determined to be 'Snowy', it must be true that the temperature is below 0 degrees Celsius.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that if the weather condition is snowy, it can indeed be inferred that the temperature is below zero without needing to look at temperature recordings.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
