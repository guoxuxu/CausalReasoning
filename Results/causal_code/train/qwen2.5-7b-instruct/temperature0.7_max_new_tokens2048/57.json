    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `increaseHeat(units)` method is responsible for increasing the temperature.\n2. If the temperature increases by more than 5 degrees (i.e., if the new temperature is greater than 25), then the humidity will increase by 5 percentage points.\n3. The question asks if the humidity will likely increase if the temperature increases significantly.\n\nGiven that:\n- A significant increase in temperature would mean the temperature goes above 25.\n- When the temperature exceeds 25, the condition `if (this.temperature > 25)` evaluates to true.\n- This triggers the line `this.humidity += 5;`, which directly increases the humidity.\n\nTherefore, if the temperature increases significantly, it is likely that the humidity will also increase due to the direct relationship established in the code.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The question asks if the humidity will likely increase when the temperature increases significantly.\n\nNow, let's analyze:\n- \"Significantly\" implies a substantial increase in temperature.\n- According to the code, if the temperature increases by more than 5 degrees, the humidity will increase by 5%.\n\nTherefore, if the temperature increases significantly (more than 5 degrees), the humidity will indeed increase as a result.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
