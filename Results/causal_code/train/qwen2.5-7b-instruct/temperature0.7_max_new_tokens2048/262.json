  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The conditional logic in the function assigns 'admission' status of 'Yes' only if the 'total' score exceeds 240. Therefore, a 'Yes' in 'admission' implies that the 'total' score was above 240.",
  "causal_map": "math → total; physics → total; literature → total; total > 240 → admission = Yes",

    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_scores` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. It calculates the total score by summing up the values of 'math', 'physics', and 'literature'.\n3. If the total score is greater than 240, it sets 'admission' to 'Yes'.\n4. Otherwise, it sets 'admission' to 'No'.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition for 'admission' being 'Yes':\n- For 'admission' to be 'Yes', the condition `data['total'] > 240` must be true.\n\nHowever, the question asks if 'admission' being 'Yes' means the 'total' score was always above 240. This is not necessarily true because:\n- The function only checks if the total score is greater than 240, but it doesn't set 'admission' to 'Yes' unless this condition is met.\n- There is no \"always\" clause; it just checks the condition at that moment.\n\nTherefore, 'admission' being 'Yes' means the total score was above 240 at the time of computation, but it does not imply that the score was always above 240.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_scores` calculates the total score by summing up the values of 'math', 'physics', and 'literature'.\n\n2.

However, if the total score is 240 or less, it sets the 'admission' status to 'No'.\n\n5. This means that an 'admission' status of 'Yes' only occurs when the total score is strictly greater than 240.\n\n6. There is no scenario where the 'admission' status would be 'Yes' if the total score was exactly 240 or below 240.\n\nTherefore, if the 'admission' status is 'Yes', it does mean that the 'total' score was always above 240.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
