  "Explanation": "Cleaning the filter and then turning on the air purifier sets both conditions required by the `check_air_quality` method to yield 'Good' air quality. Cleaning the filter sets `filter_dirty` to False and turning it on sets `is_on` to True. As both conditions are satisfied, it results in improved and 'Good' air quality.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The air purifier is initialized with `is_on` set to `False` and `filter_dirty` set to `True`.\n\n2. **Cleaning the Filter**:\n   - When we call `clean_filter()`, the `filter_dirty` attribute is set to `False`.\n\n3. **Turning On the Air Purifier**:\n   - Now, when we call `turn_on()`, it checks two conditions:\n     1. If the air purifier is currently on (`self.is_on`).\n     2. If the filter is not dirty (`not self.filter_dirty`).\n\n4. **After Cleaning and Turning On**:\n   - After cleaning, `filter_dirty` is `False`.\n   - When turning on, both conditions for `turn_on()` are met (the purifier is off but becomes on, and the filter is no longer dirty).\n   - Therefore, `is_on` is set to `True`.\n\n5. **Checking Air Quality**:\n   - With the air purifier now on and the filter clean, the condition in `check_air_quality()` is met:\n     - `if self.is_on and not self.filter_dirty:`\n     - This returns `'Good'`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the air quality will indeed improve after cleaning the filter and then turning on the air purifier.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `AirPurifier` object is initialized with `is_on` as `False` and `filter_dirty` as `True`.\n\n2. **Cleaning the Filter**:\n   - We call the `clean_filter()` method.\n   - This sets `self.filter_dirty` to `False`.\n\n3. **Turning On the Air Purifier**:\n   - We call the `turn_on()` method.\n   - According to the logic in `turn_on()`, if `self.filter_dirty` is `False`, then `self.is_on` is set to `True`.\n   - So, after calling `turn_on()`, `self.is_on` will be `True` and `self.filter_dirty` will remain `False`.\n\n4. **Checking Air Quality**:\n   - We now call the `check_air_quality()` method.\n   - The condition in `check_air_quality()` checks if `self.is_on` is `True` and `self.filter_dirty` is `False`.\n   - Since both conditions are met (`self.is_on` is `True` and `self.filter_dirty` is `False`), the method returns `'Good'`.\n\nTherefore, cleaning the filter and then turning on the air purifier will indeed result in an improvement in air quality.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
