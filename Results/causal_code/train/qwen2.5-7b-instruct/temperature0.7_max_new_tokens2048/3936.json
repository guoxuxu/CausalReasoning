    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `VideoGame` class has two methods:\n   - `playGame()`: This method increases the score by 100 if `hasPowerUp` is true, and then always increases the score by 10.\n   - `enablePowerUp()`: This method sets `hasPowerUp` to true.\n\n2. If `enablePowerUp()` is called before `playGame()`, it means that `hasPowerUp` will be set to true right before `playGame()` is executed.\n\n3. When `playGame()` is called after `enablePowerUp()`:\n   - Since `hasPowerUp` is true, the first part of the `if` statement inside `playGame()` will execute, adding 100 to the score.\n   - Regardless of the value of `hasPowerUp`, the second part of `playGame()` will always add 10 to the score.\n\n4. Therefore, the total increase in score will be 100 (from the power-up) + 10 (always added), which equals 110.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `score` is an integer initialized to some value (let's call it `S`).\n   - `hasPowerUp` is a boolean set to `false`.\n\n2. **Calling `enablePowerUp()`**:\n   - This method sets `hasPowerUp` to `true`.\n   - So now, `hasPowerUp` is `true`.\n\n3. **Calling `playGame()`**:\n   - The `playGame()` method checks if `hasPowerUp` is `true`.\n   - Since `hasPowerUp` is `true`, the first condition `if (hasPowerUp)` is satisfied.\n   - Inside this block, `score` is incremented by `100`.\n   - Then, regardless of the value of `hasPowerUp`, `score` is incremented by `10`.\n\n4. **Final Score Calculation**:\n   - First increment due to `hasPowerUp`: `score += 100`\n   - Second increment: `score += 10`\n   - Total increment: `100 + 10 = 110`\n\nTherefore, if `enablePowerUp` is called before `playGame`, the `score` will indeed increase by 110.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `score` is an integer that starts at 0.\n   - `hasPowerUp` is a boolean that starts as `false`.\n\n2. **Calling `enablePowerUp()`**:\n   - This method sets `hasPowerUp` to `true`.\n   - So, after calling `enablePowerUp()`, `hasPowerUp` becomes `true`.\n\n3. **Calling `playGame()`**:\n   - The `playGame()` method first checks if `hasPowerUp` is `true`.\n   - Since `hasPowerUp` is now `true`, the method executes the block inside the `if` statement.\n   - It adds 100 to `score` because `hasPowerUp` is `true`.\n   - Then, it adds 10 more to `score` regardless of the value of `hasPowerUp`.\n   - Therefore, `score` increases by 100 + 10 = 110.\n\nBased on this reasoning, if `enablePowerUp()` is called before `playGame()`, the `score` will indeed increase by 110.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Regardless of whether `hasPowerUp` is true or not, it always adds 10 to the `score`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we call `enablePowerUp` before calling `playGame`:\n\n4. Calling `enablePowerUp` sets `hasPowerUp` to true.\n5. When `playGame` is called after this, it will enter the if block because `hasPowerUp` is now true.\n6.
