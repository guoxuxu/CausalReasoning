    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `qualityCheckPassed` variable is set to `true` only under one specific condition: when both `hasEngine` and `hasTransmission` are `true`.\n\n2. The `performQualityCheck()` method checks these conditions and sets `qualityCheckPassed` to `true` if both are met.\n\n3. However, the methods `installEngine()` and `installTransmission()` do not directly set `qualityCheckPassed` to `true`. Instead, they only update the `hasEngine` and `hasTransmission` variables.\n\n4. For `qualityCheckPassed` to be set to `true`, both `installEngine()` and `installTransmission()` must have been called and executed successfully, ensuring that both `hasEngine` and `hasTransmission` are `true`.\n\n5. There could be other ways to set `qualityCheckPassed` to `true`, such as modifying the code outside the provided snippet, but based on the given code, direct setting of `qualityCheckPassed` to `true` without calling `installEngine()` and `installTransmission()` would not be possible.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that if `qualityCheckPassed` is directly set to `true`, it does imply that both `installEngine` and `installTransmission` were necessarily called.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

For `qualityCheckPassed` to be set to true, both `installEngine()` and `installTransmission()` must have been called because:\n   - `installEngine()` sets `hasEngine` to true.\n   - `installTransmission()` sets `hasTransmission` to true.\n4. There is no other way for both `hasEngine` and `hasTransmission` to be true without calling these methods.\n5.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1.

If we directly intervene and set `qualityCheckPassed` to true, we need to determine if both `installEngine` and `installTransmission` were necessarily called.\n\n3.
