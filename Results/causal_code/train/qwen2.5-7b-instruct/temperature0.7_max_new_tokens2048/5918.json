    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial state of the `WeatherSimulator` is:\n   - Temperature: 25\n   - Humidity: 50\n\n2.

The `decreaseHumidity(35)` method is called:\n   - New humidity: 50 - 35 = 15\n   - Since 15 is less than 20, the temperature increases by 3.\n   - New temperature: 35 + 3 = 38\n\n4.
