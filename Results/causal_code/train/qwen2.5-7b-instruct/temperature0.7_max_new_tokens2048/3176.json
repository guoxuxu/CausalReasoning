    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `SalesReport` class has three key attributes:\n   - `base_price`: The original price of the item.\n   - `tax_rate`: The rate at which tax is applied.\n   - `final_price`: The calculated final price after applying tax.\n\n2. The `calculate_final_price` method computes the final price using the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{final\\_price} = (\\text{base\\_price} + \\text{base\\_price} \\times \\frac{\\text{tax\\_rate}}{100})\n   \\]\n\n3. The `apply_discount` method reduces the `base_price` by the specified discount amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{base\\_price} -= \\text{discount}\n   \\]\n\n4. In the given code:\n   - A `SalesReport` instance is created with a base price of 100 and a tax rate of 10%.\n   - `calculate_final_price` is called first, resulting in a final price of \\(100 + 100 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 110\\).\n   - Then, `apply_discount` is called with a discount of 10, reducing the `base_price` to 90.\n   - Finally, `calculate_final_price` is called again, resulting in a new final price of \\(90 + 90 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 99\\).\n\n5. The relationship between the discount and the final price is direct:\n   - A larger discount leads to a smaller `base_price`.\n   - A smaller `base_price` results in a lower final price, because the final price is based on the discounted base price plus tax.\n\nTherefore, if a larger discount is applied, the final price will indeed be reduced.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The `SalesReport` object is initialized with a base price of 100 and a tax rate of 10%.\n   - Initially, `final_price` is not set.\n\n2. **First Calculation**:\n   - The `calculate_final_price` method is called, which calculates the final price as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_price} = \\text{base\\_price} + (\\text{base\\_price} \\times \\text{tax\\_rate} / 100) = 100 + (100 \\times 10 / 100) = 100 + 10 = 110\n     \\]\n   - So, after the first calculation, `final_price` is 110.\n\n3. **Applying Discount**:\n   - The `apply_discount` method is called with a discount of 10.
