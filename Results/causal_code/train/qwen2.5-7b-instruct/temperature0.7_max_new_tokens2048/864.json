  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The function `traffic_volume` specifies that traffic volume will be 'high' if the weather is either 'sunny' or 'cloudy'. Since the weather is given as 'sunny', this leads to high traffic volume according to the function definition.",
  "causal_map": "weather → traffic; weather → accident_risk",
  "causal_map_integration": "The weather influences both traffic volume and accident risk. Sunny or cloudy weather leads to high traffic volume, while stormy weather results in low traffic volume. Additionally, traffic volume and weather conditions together determine the accident risk.",
