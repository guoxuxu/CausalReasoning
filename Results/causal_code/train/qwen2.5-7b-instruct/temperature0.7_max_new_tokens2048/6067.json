    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `ShoppingBasket` class has an `add_item` method that adds an item to the basket and increases the total cost by the price of that item.\n\n2. The `add_item` method modifies the `total_cost` attribute directly by adding the price of the item.\n\n3. There are no other methods in the provided code that modify the `total_cost` except for `apply_discount`.\n\n4. If we call `add_item` multiple times, each time it will:\n   - Add the item to the list of items\n   - Increase the `total_cost` by the price of the item\n\n5. No other method is called between calls to `add_item`, so there's no way to reset or reduce the `total_cost`.\n\n6. Therefore, every call to `add_item` will consistently increase the `total_cost` by the price of the added item.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if the 'add_item' method is called more times, the 'total_cost' will indeed increase without any other method being called in between.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ShoppingBasket` class has an `__init__` method that initializes an empty list `items` and a variable `total_cost` set to 0.\n\n2. The `add_item` method takes two parameters: `item` and `price`. When called, it appends the item to the `items` list and adds the price to `total_cost`.\n\n3. The `apply_discount` method takes one parameter: `discount_percentage`. It applies the discount to `total_cost` but does not modify `total_cost` directly; instead, it multiplies `total_cost` by `(1 - discount_percentage/100)`.\n\n4. In the given code snippet:\n   - `basket.add_item('apple', 1)` adds an apple costing $1 to the basket.\n   - `basket.add_item('banana', 2)` adds a banana costing $2 to the basket.\n   - `basket.apply_discount(10)` applies a 10% discount to the total cost.\n\n5. The key point here is that the `add_item` method only adds items and their prices to the basket. It does not perform any operations on `total_cost` unless explicitly called.\n\n6. The question asks if calling `add_item` more times will increase `total_cost` without any other method being called.\n\n7. Based on the implementation of `add_item`, each call to this method will indeed increase `total_cost` by the price of the item added.\n\nTherefore, if `add_item` is called more times without any other method being called, `total_cost` will indeed increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ShoppingBasket` class has an `__init__` method that initializes two attributes: `items` as an empty list and `total_cost` as 0.\n\n2. The `add_item` method takes two parameters: `item` and `price`. When called, it appends the item to the `items` list and adds the price to the `total_cost`.\n\n3. The `apply_discount` method takes a single parameter `discount_percentage`. It applies a discount to the `total_cost` based on the given percentage.\n\n4. We create an instance of `ShoppingBasket` named `basket`.\n\n5. We call `add_item` twice with the items 'apple' and 'banana' and their respective prices 1 and 2.\n\n6. Each time `add_item` is called, it directly modifies the `total_cost` by adding the price of the item.\n\n7. No other methods besides `add_item` are called between the additions of items.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if the `add_item` method is called more times, the `total_cost` will indeed increase each time because `add_item` directly updates `total_cost` with the price of the item added.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We have a `ShoppingBasket` class with methods to manage items and their costs.\n2. The `add_item` method adds an item to the basket and updates the total cost by adding the price of the item.\n3. The `apply_discount` method reduces the total cost by the specified percentage.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: If the 'add_item' method is called more times, will the 'total_cost' increase without any other method being called?\n\n4. When `add_item` is called, it appends an item to the list and increases the total cost by the price of that item.\n5. If `add_item` is called multiple times, each call will incrementally increase the `total_cost` by the respective item prices.\n6. No other method is called between these calls to `add_item`, so there are no operations that would reduce the total cost.\n\nBased on this reasoning, if we only call `add_item` and do not call any other method to modify the total cost, the `total_cost` will indeed increase with each call to `add_item`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
