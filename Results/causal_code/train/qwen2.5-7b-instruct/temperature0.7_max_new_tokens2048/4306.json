  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "During `simulate_day`, `increase_temp` is called with a delta of 5, which always increases the temperature by 5 degrees. This direct method call within `simulate_day` ensures that the temperature will increase, showing a clear cause-effect relationship without external interventions.",
  "causal_map": "simulate_day → increase_temp; increase_temp → temperature",

There is a conditional check after increasing the temperature, but it only applies if the new temperature exceeds 30 degrees.\n\nGiven that the initial temperature is set to 20 degrees in the constructor, increasing it by 5 degrees results in a new temperature of 25 degrees.\n\nSince 25 degrees does not exceed 30 degrees, the conditional check in the `increase_temp` method does not trigger, and thus the humidity is not affected.\n\nTherefore, the temperature does indeed increase when `simulate_day` is called.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
