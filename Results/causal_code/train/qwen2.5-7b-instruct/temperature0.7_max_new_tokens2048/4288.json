    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `mood` variable is set to 'happy'.\n2. The `weather_effect` function is called with `mood` as an argument.\n3. Inside `weather_effect`, since `mood` is 'happy', it returns either 'sunny' or 'cloudy' randomly.\n4. The `activity_decision` function is then called with the result of `weather_effect`.\n5. If the weather is 'sunny', `activity_decision` returns 'picnic'.\n6. If the weather is 'cloudy', `activity_decision` returns 'read a book'.\n\nNow, if we intervene to ensure the weather is always sunny, the flow would be:\n\n- `mood` is still 'happy'.\n- `weather_effect(mood)` would always return 'sunny' (due to our intervention).\n- `activity_decision('sunny')` would return 'picnic'.\n\nTherefore, if the weather is always ensured to be sunny, the chosen activity will indeed always be a picnic.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
