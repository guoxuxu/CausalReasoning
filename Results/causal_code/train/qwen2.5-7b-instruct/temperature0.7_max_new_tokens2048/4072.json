Manually intervening by setting red_light to False and yellow_light to True:\n   - This would override the current state of the lights.\n\n6. Calling `change_light('NEXT')` after manual intervention:\n   - The state should still be RED (since we haven't called `change_light` with 'RESET').\n   - However, due to our manual intervention, red_light is already False and yellow_light is already True.\n   - When 'NEXT' is called, the state should transition from RED to GREEN.\n   - In this case, green_light would be set to True.\n\nTherefore, even though the state would normally transition through YELLOW, the manual intervention has already put the yellow light on.
