  "Explanation": "Setting 'age' to 21, which is greater than 18, directly influences 'is_adult' to be True. There are no other contributing factors in the code that affect 'is_adult'.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` checks if 'age' is in the input data.\n2. If 'age' is present, it sets `data['is_adult']` to whether the age is greater than or equal to 18.\n3. If 'age' is always modified to return 21, we need to check if 21 is greater than or equal to 18.\n\n4. 21 is indeed greater than 18.\n5. Therefore, regardless of what 'age' is set to (as long as it's 21), `data['is_adult']` will always be True.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
