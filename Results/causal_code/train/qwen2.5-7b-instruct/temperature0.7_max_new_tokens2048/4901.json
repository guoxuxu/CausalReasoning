    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `adjust_temperature` takes three parameters: `room_temp`, `target_temp`, and `heater_on`.\n\n2. The key part of the logic is the first condition:\n   - If `heater_on` is True, `room_temp` increases by 2.\n   - If `heater_on` is False, the function checks if `room_temp` is greater than `target_temp`. If so, it decreases `room_temp` by 1.\n\n3. The problem statement says that `heater_on` will be set to True regardless of `room_temp`.\n\n4. Given that `heater_on` is always True, we can ignore the second condition (the one involving `target_temp`).\n\n5. Since `heater_on` is always True, the function will always execute the block of code that increments `room_temp` by 2.\n\n6. Therefore, `room_temp` will always increase when `heater_on` is set to True, regardless of its initial value.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the function and analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The function `adjust_temperature` takes three parameters: `room_temp`, `target_temp`, and `heater_on`.\n\n2.

If so, it decreases `room_temp` by 1.\n\n4. The question asks if setting `heater_on` to `True` (regardless of the values of `room_temp` and `target_temp`) will necessarily result in an increase in `room_temp`.\n\nGiven that we set `heater_on` to `True`, let's see what happens:\n\n- When `heater_on` is `True`, the function directly increases `room_temp` by 2.\n- This increase will always happen irrespective of the initial value of `room_temp`.\n\nTherefore, if `heater_on` is set to `True`, `room_temp` will definitely increase by 2.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Given that `heater_on` is set to True, the only relevant part of the function is `room_temp += 2`, which will always increase `room_temp` by 2.\n\nTherefore, under the condition where `heater_on` is set to True, `room_temp` will necessarily increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Therefore, every time the function is called with `heater_on` set to `True`, `room_temp` will always be increased by 2.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that `room_temp` will necessarily increase when `heater_on` is set to `True`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
