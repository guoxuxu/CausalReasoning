    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_statistics` calculates the mean and variance of a given dataset.\n2. Variance is defined as the average of the squared differences from the Mean.\n3. For variance to be zero, every element in the dataset must be exactly equal to the mean.\n4. If all elements in the dataset are the same, then the mean will also be that same value, and the difference between each element and the mean will be zero.\n5. Squaring zero gives zero, and averaging a bunch of zeros results in zero variance.\n6. Therefore, if the variance calculated by the function is zero, it implies that all elements in the dataset are indeed the same.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can infer that if the computed variance is zero, all elements in 'data_points' are the same without explicitly checking 'data_points'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
