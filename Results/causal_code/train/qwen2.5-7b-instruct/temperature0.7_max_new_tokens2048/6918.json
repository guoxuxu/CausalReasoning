    "Let's break down the logic of the `check_health` function to determine the answer:\n\n1. **Condition 1:** If `system_status == 'good'` and `error_logs` is `False` (i.e., there are no error logs), the function returns 'System is healthy'.\n2. **Condition 2:** If `system_status == 'good'` but `error_logs` is `True` (i.e., there are error logs), the function returns 'Check logs for warnings'.\n3. **Condition 3:** If `system_status == 'bad'` and `error_logs` is `True`, the function returns 'System failure imminent'.\n4. **Else:** If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Status unclear, check manually'.\n\nGiven the specific condition where `system_status` is 'good' and `error_logs` is `False`, we can see that this matches the first condition exactly.\n\nTherefore, if the system status is 'good' with no error logs, the returned message will indeed indicate that the system is healthy.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We have a function `check_health` that takes two parameters: `system_status` and `error_logs`.\n2. The function has multiple conditions to evaluate based on these inputs.\n3. We need to focus on the specific case where `system_status` is 'good' and there are no error logs (`not error_logs`).\n\nNow, let's look at the relevant part of the function logic:\n\n- If `system_status == 'good'` and `not error_logs`, it returns 'System is healthy'.\n\nGiven this information, we can directly answer the question:\n\nThe condition matches exactly when the system status is 'good' and there are no error logs, and in this case, the function returns 'System is healthy'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We are given a function `check_health` that takes two parameters: `system_status` and `error_logs`.\n\n2. The function has four conditions to evaluate:\n   - If `system_status` is 'good' and there are no error logs (`not error_logs`), it returns 'System is healthy'.\n   - If `system_status` is 'good' but there are error logs, it returns 'Check logs for warnings'.\n   - If `system_status` is 'bad' and there are error logs, it returns 'System failure imminent'.\n   - Otherwise, it returns 'Status unclear, check manually'.\n\n3. The question specifically asks about the case where `system_status` is 'good' and there are no error logs.\n\n4. Looking at the first condition in the function, we see that when `system_status` is 'good' and `not error_logs` (which means error_logs is False), the function returns 'System is healthy'.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"If the system status is 'good' with no error logs, will the returned message indicate the system is healthy?\" is Yes.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `check_health` takes two parameters: `system_status` and `error_logs`.\n2. We need to evaluate the conditions based on these parameters.\n3. The first condition checks if `system_status` is 'good' and `error_logs` is false (i.e., no error logs).\n4. If both conditions are true, the function returns 'System is healthy'.\n5. The question specifically asks about the scenario where `system_status` is 'good' and there are no error logs.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can see that when `system_status` is 'good' and `error_logs` is false, the function indeed returns 'System is healthy'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We need to focus on the condition where `system_status` is 'good' and there are no error logs.\n2.

If both conditions are met (i.e., `system_status` is 'good' AND `error_logs` is false), the function returns the string 'System is healthy'.\n4. No other conditions in the function would apply in this case.\n\nTherefore, if the system status is 'good' with no error logs, the returned message will indeed indicate that the system is healthy.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
