    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Base Score**: The base score is always 100.\n2. **Age Factor**: If age > 50, the age factor is 0.9; otherwise, it is 1.\n3. **BMI Factor**: If bmi > 25, the bmi factor is 0.8; otherwise, it is 1.\n4. **Exercise Factor**: This is calculated as \\(1 + (exercise\\_freq \\times 0.05)\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the exercise frequency is increased by 3 times.\n\n- **Current Exercise Frequency**: Let's denote this as \\(E\\).\n- **New Exercise Frequency**: This would be \\(3E\\).\n\nThe new exercise factor would then be:\n\\[1 + (3E \\times 0.05) = 1 + 0.15E\\]\n\nSince the exercise factor is directly proportional to the exercise frequency, increasing the exercise frequency by 3 times will definitely increase the exercise factor.\n\nNext, let's consider the BMI factor. If the BMI is high (i.e., greater than 25), the BMI factor is 0.8. Increasing the exercise frequency does not affect the BMI factor.\n\nTherefore, even if the BMI is high, increasing the exercise frequency will still result in a higher overall health score because the exercise factor will increase while the BMI factor remains constant at 0.8.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Base Score**: The base score is always 100.\n2. **Age Factor**: If the age is greater than 50, the age factor is 0.9; otherwise, it's 1.\n3. **BMI Factor**: If the BMI is greater than 25, the BMI factor is 0.8; otherwise, it's 1.\n4. **Exercise Factor**: This is calculated as `1 + (exercise_freq * 0.05)`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the exercise frequency is increased by 3 times:\n\n- If the exercise frequency was `x`, then the new exercise frequency would be `3x`.\n- The new exercise factor would be `1 + (3x * 0.05) = 1 + 0.15x`.\n\nThe health score formula is:\n\\[ \\text{health\\_score} = \\text{base\\_score} \\times \\text{age\\_factor} \\times \\text{bmi\\_factor} \\times \\text{exercise\\_factor} \\]\n\nGiven that the base score is fixed at 100, the age factor and BMI factor remain unchanged (assuming no change in these factors), the key change comes from the exercise factor.\n\nFor the exercise factor:\n- Original: \\(1 + (x \\times 0.05)\\)\n- New: \\(1 + (3x \\times 0.05) = 1 + 0.15x\\)\n\nClearly, \\(1 + 0.15x\\) is greater than \\(1 + 0.05x\\) for any positive value of \\(x\\). Therefore, increasing the exercise frequency by 3 times will definitely result in a higher health score.\n\nHowever, this analysis does not consider the case where the BMI is high (i.e., greater than 25), which would reduce the BMI factor to 0.8. If the BMI factor is 0.8, the overall health score would be reduced because it multiplies the entire expression. \n\nBut since the question asks about \"definite increase,\" and considering that the exercise factor alone increases with more exercise, the answer focuses on the exercise part.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Base Score**: The base score is always 100.\n\n2. **Age Factor**:\n   - If the age is > 50, the age factor is 0.9.\n   - If the age is ≤ 50, the age factor is 1.\n\n3. **BMI Factor**:\n   - If the BMI is > 25, the BMI factor is 0.8.\n   - If the BMI is ≤ 25, the BMI factor is 1.\n\n4. **Exercise Factor**:\n   - This is calculated as `1 + (exercise_freq * 0.05)`.\n   - If exercise frequency increases by 3 times, the new exercise factor would be `1 + (3 * 0.05) = 1.15`.\n\n5. **Health Score Calculation**:\n   - Health score = Base score * Age factor * BMI factor * Exercise factor\n   - With the original exercise frequency, let's say it was `x`, the health score would be `100 * age_factor * bmi_factor * (1 + (x * 0.05))`.\n   - With the increased exercise frequency (3x), the health score would be `100 * age_factor * bmi_factor * (1 + (3x * 0.05))`.\n\n6. **Comparison**:\n   - Original health score: `100 * age_factor * bmi_factor * (1 + x * 0.05)`\n   - New health score: `100 * age_factor * bmi_factor * (1 + 3x * 0.05)`\n   - The difference between the new and original health scores is:\n     `(1 + 3x * 0.05) - (1 + x * 0.05) = 2x * 0.05 = 0.1x`\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since `0.1x` is always positive (assuming `x` is positive), there will be a definite increase in the health score when the exercise frequency is increased by 3 times, regardless of the values of age and BMI.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Base Score**: The base score is always 100.\n2. **Age Factor**: This depends on whether the age is over 50.

Increasing the exercise frequency from `x` to `3x` will increase the exercise factor from `1 + (x * 0.05)` to `1 + (3x * 0.05) = 1 + (0.15x)`.\n\nSince the exercise factor is directly proportional to the exercise frequency and the increase from `x` to `3x` is significant, the new exercise factor will definitely be greater than the original one. Therefore, the overall health score will increase because the product of all factors (age factor, BMI factor, and the increased exercise factor) will be larger than the original score.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

For every additional time exercised per week, the factor increases by 0.05.\n   - If the exercise frequency is tripled, the factor becomes \\(1 + (3 \\times 0.05) = 1.15\\).\n\n5. **Health Score Calculation**:\n   - The health score is calculated as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{health\\_score} = \\text{base\\_score} \\times \\text{age\\_factor} \\times \\text{bmi\\_factor} \\times \\text{exercise\\_factor}\n     \\]\n   - With the exercise frequency tripled, the new exercise factor is 1.15.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where BMI is high (greater than 25), and we triple the exercise frequency:\n\n- The BMI factor will be 0.8.\n- The exercise factor will be 1.15.\n\nThe original health score without tripling the exercise frequency would be:\n\\[\n\\text{original\\_health\\_score} = 100 \\times \\text{age\\_factor} \\times 0.8 \\times \\text{exercise\\_factor}\n\\]\n\nThe new health score after tripling the exercise frequency would be:\n\\[\n\\text{new\\_health\\_score} = 100 \\times \\text{age\\_factor} \\times 0.8 \\times 1.15\n\\]\n\nSince \\(1.15 > 1\\), the new health score will definitely be higher than the original health score because the exercise factor has increased from 1 to 1.15.\n\nTherefore, even if the BMI is high, tripling the exercise frequency will result in a definite increase in the health score.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the factors affecting the health score:**\n   - `base_score` (always 100)\n   - `age_factor`: depends on whether the age is greater than 50.\n   - `bmi_factor`: depends on whether the BMI is greater than 25.\n   - `exercise_factor`: depends on the exercise frequency.\n\n2. **Effect of changing exercise frequency:**\n   - The `exercise_factor` is calculated as \\(1 + (exercise\\_freq \\times 0.05)\\).\n   - If the exercise frequency increases by 3 times, the new `exercise_factor` would be \\(1 + (3 \\times 0.05) = 1 + 0.15 = 1.15\\).\n\n3. **Effect of a high BMI:**\n   - If the BMI is high (greater than 25), the `bmi_factor` is 0.8.\n   - This means the health score will be reduced by a factor of 0.8 compared to someone with a normal BMI.\n\n4. **Impact of increased exercise on health score:**\n   - Increasing the exercise frequency from `x` to `3x` will increase the `exercise_factor` from \\(1 + (x \\times 0.05)\\) to \\(1 + (3x \\times 0.05) = 1.15\\).\n   - Even if the `bmi_factor` is 0.8 (due to a high BMI), the overall effect on the health score will still be positive because the increase in `exercise_factor` (from 1 to 1.15) will outweigh the reduction due to the high `bmi_factor`.\n\nTherefore, increasing the exercise frequency by 3 times will definitely result in an increase in the health score, even if the BMI is high.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
