    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `risk_level` method calculates the risk based on two factors: age and smoking status.\n2. If the person's age is greater than 50, the method adds 2 to the risk.\n3. The method also considers whether the person is a smoker and adds 3 to the risk if they are.\n4. So, if someone's age increases beyond 50, the `if self.age > 50:` condition will be true.\n5. As a result, 2 points will be added to the risk level due to the increased age.\n\nBased on this reasoning, if someone's age increases beyond 50, their risk level will indeed increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
