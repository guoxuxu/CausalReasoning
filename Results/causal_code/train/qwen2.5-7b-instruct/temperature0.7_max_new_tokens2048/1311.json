    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - We start with `HealthSystem(10, 100)`, meaning there are initially 10 doctors and 100 patients.\n   - The `schedule_appointments` method calculates the number of appointments based on the current number of doctors and patients.\n\n2. **First Method Call**:\n   - `health_sys.schedule_appointments()` is called initially. With 10 doctors and 100 patients, each doctor would be responsible for \\( \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\) appointments.\n\n3. **Increase Doctors**:\n   - `health_sys.increase_doctors(2)` increases the number of doctors to 12.\n   - The `schedule_appointments` method is then called again, recalculating the appointments as \\( \\frac{100}{12} \\approx 8.33 \\). Since we can't have fractional appointments, it likely rounds down to 8 or up to 9, but the important point is that it changes from 10 to something less than 10.\n\n4. **Emergency Increase**:\n   - `health_sys.emergency(5)` adds 5 emergencies, increasing the number of patients to 105.\n   - If we recalculate after this, the number of appointments per doctor would be \\( \\frac{105}{12} \\approx 8.75 \\), which again likely rounds to either 8 or 9.\n\nIn all these steps, the number of appointments per doctor decreases when the number of doctors increases. This is because more doctors mean each doctor has fewer patients to see.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's analyze the code step by step to determine if the number of scheduled appointments per doctor changes when the number of doctors increases.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - `health_sys = HealthSystem(10, 100)` initializes the system with 10 doctors and 100 patients.\n   - `health_sys.schedule_appointments()` sets the initial number of appointments based on the current number of doctors (10) and patients (100). Since `num_patients // num_doctors` is `100 // 10`, the initial number of appointments is 10.\n\n2. **Increasing Doctors**:\n   - `health_sys.increase_doctors(2)` increases the number of doctors by 2, making it 12 doctors.\n   - The `schedule_appointments` method is called again, recalculating the number of appointments as `100 // 12`, which results in approximately 8.33 appointments per doctor. Since the number of appointments must be an integer, it will round down to 8.\n\n3. **Emergency Increase**:\n   - `health_sys.emergency(5)` increases the number of emergencies by 5.\n   - If the number of emergencies exceeds the number of doctors (which it does, since 5 > 12), the excess emergencies (`5 - 12`) are added to the number of patients, resulting in an additional 5 patients.\n   - The `schedule_appointments` method is called again, recalculating the number of appointments as `(100 + 5) // 12`, which is `105 // 12`, resulting in approximately 8.75 appointments per doctor, rounding down to 8.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that increasing the number of doctors indeed changes the number of scheduled appointments per doctor. Initially, there were 10 appointments per doctor, but after increasing the number of doctors to 12, the number of appointments per doctor decreased to 8.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `schedule_appointments` method calculates the number of appointments based on the current number of doctors and patients.\n   - It uses the formula: `self.appointments = self.num_patients // self.num_doctors`\n\n2. When the number of doctors increases, the method is called again (either directly or indirectly) to recalculate the number of appointments.\n\n3. In the provided code:\n   - Initially, `health_sys` has 10 doctors and 100 patients.\n   - `schedule_appointments()` is called, resulting in 10 appointments per doctor.\n   - Then `increase_doctors(2)` is called, increasing the number of doctors to 12.\n   - `schedule_appointments()` is implicitly called again after increasing the doctors, recalculating the number of appointments.\n   - Finally, `emergency(5)` is called, which doesn't directly affect the number of doctors but could potentially adjust the patient count.\n\n4. Given that `schedule_appointments()` is explicitly called when doctors are increased, and implicitly called as part of the method chaining, the number of appointments per doctor will indeed change when the number of doctors changes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - We start with `health_sys` initialized with 10 doctors and 100 patients.\n   - The `schedule_appointments` method calculates the number of appointments based on the current number of doctors and patients.\n\n2. **First Method Call**:\n   - `health_sys.schedule_appointments()` is called initially.\n   - With 10 doctors and 100 patients, the number of appointments per doctor is \\( \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\).\n\n3. **Increase Doctors**:\n   - `health_sys.increase_doctors(2)` is called, increasing the number of doctors to 12.\n   - Now, the `schedule_appointments` method is called again.\n   - With 12 doctors and still 100 patients, the number of appointments per doctor is \\( \\frac{100}{12} \\approx 8.33 \\).\n\n4. **Emergency Call**:\n   - `health_sys.emergency(5)` is called.\n   - This adds 5 more patients (emergency cases) to the existing 100 patients, making it 105 patients.\n   - The number of doctors remains 12.\n   - The number of appointments per doctor now becomes \\( \\frac{105}{12} \\approx 8.75 \\).\n\nFrom these steps, we can see that when the number of doctors increases, the number of scheduled appointments per doctor changes accordingly. Initially, there were 10 appointments per doctor, after increasing the doctors to 12, the number of appointments per doctor decreased to approximately 8.33, and further adding patients but keeping the same number of doctors would change the ratio again.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthSystem` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the number of doctors (`num_doctors`) and patients (`num_patients`), and sets the initial number of appointments to 0.\n\n2. There is a `schedule_appointments` method that calculates the number of appointments based on the current number of doctors and patients. It uses integer division (`//`) to determine how many appointments each doctor can handle.\n\n3. The `increase_doctors` method updates the number of doctors and then calls `schedule_appointments` to recalculate the number of appointments.\n\n4. The `emergency` method handles emergencies where the number of emergencies exceeds the number of doctors. In such cases, it increases the patient load and recalculates appointments.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that when the number of doctors changes (either due to an initial setup or through the `increase_doctors` method), the `schedule_appointments` method is called, which recalculates the number of appointments based on the updated number of doctors.\n\nTherefore, if the number of doctors increases, the number of scheduled appointments per doctor will indeed change because the `schedule_appointments` method will be called again with the updated number of doctors.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"

This results in 10 appointments per doctor.\n3. `increase_doctors(2)` is called, increasing the number of doctors to 12. The `schedule_appointments()` method is then called again, recalculating the number of appointments based on the new number of doctors (12).\n4. With 12 doctors and 100 patients, the new number of appointments per doctor would be 100 // 12 ≈ 8.33 (rounded down to 8).\n5. The `emergency` method is called with 5 emergencies. Since there are still only 12 doctors, no additional patients are added, and the number of appointments remains at 8.\n\nFrom these steps, we can see that when the number of doctors increases, the number of scheduled appointments per doctor does indeed change.
