    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `isActive` status is determined in the `updateActivity()` method.\n2. This method checks if `caloriesBurned > caloriesConsumed`.\n3. If this condition is true, `isActive` is set to `true`.\n4. If the condition is false, `isActive` is set to `false`.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that:\n\n- An active status (`isActive = true`) only occurs when the number of calories burned is greater than the number of calories consumed.\n- Conversely, an inactive status (`isActive = false`) can occur even if calories burned are less than or equal to calories consumed.\n\nTherefore, an active status does not always mean the person has burned more calories than they consumed. It only means that at the time of the last update, more calories were burned than consumed.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `HealthTracker` class has two main properties: `caloriesConsumed` and `caloriesBurned`.\n\n2. The `isActive` boolean is updated based on the difference between these two values.\n\n3. In the `updateActivity()` method, it checks if `caloriesBurned > caloriesConsumed`.\n\n4. If this condition is true, `isActive` is set to `true`.\n\n5. If `caloriesBurned` is not greater than `caloriesConsumed`, `isActive` is set to `false`.\n\n6. This means that `isActive` being `true` directly correlates with `caloriesBurned` being greater than `caloriesConsumed`.\n\n7. However, the question asks if an active status always means the person has burned more calories than they consumed.\n\n8. Based on the logic provided, an active status only indicates that `caloriesBurned` is greater than `caloriesConsumed` at the moment of checking.\n\n9. There could be cases where `isActive` was previously `true` but later changes in `caloriesConsumed` or `caloriesBurned` make it `false`.\n\nTherefore, an active status does not always mean the person has burned more calories than they consumed at all times.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the `isActive` field**: \n   - The `isActive` field is set to `true` only when `caloriesBurned > caloriesConsumed`.\n   - This means that `isActive` is directly dependent on the comparison between `caloriesBurned` and `caloriesConsumed`.\n\n2. **Conditions for `isActive` to be `true`**:\n   - For `isActive` to be `true`, the number of calories burned (`caloriesBurned`) must be greater than the number of calories consumed (`caloriesConsumed`).\n\n3. **Conditions for `isActive` to be `false`**:\n   - If `caloriesBurned` is less than or equal to `caloriesConsumed`, then `isActive` will be `false`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The `isActive` status is strictly tied to the calorie balance.\n   - Therefore, an active status always indicates that the person has burned more calories than they have consumed.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the statement \"an active status always means the person has burned more calories than they consumed\" is correct.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `isActive` status is determined by the `updateActivity()` method.\n2. This method checks if `caloriesBurned` is greater than `caloriesConsumed`.\n3. If `caloriesBurned` is greater, `isActive` is set to `true`.\n4. If `caloriesBurned` is not greater, `isActive` is set to `false`.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Does an active status always mean the person has burned more calories than they consumed?\n\nBased on the logic in the code:\n- An active status (`isActive = true`) only occurs when `caloriesBurned` is greater than `caloriesConsumed`.\n- Conversely, `isActive = false` occurs when `caloriesBurned` is not greater than `caloriesConsumed`, which could mean either `caloriesBurned` is less than or equal to `caloriesConsumed`.\n\nTherefore, an active status does not always mean the person has burned more calories than they consumed; it only means that the person has burned more calories.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

If the condition is false, `isActive` is set to false.\n\nNow, let's consider the definition of \"active\" in this context:\n- An active status means that the person has burned more calories than they have consumed.\n\nHowever, we need to check if there's any scenario where `isActive` can be true even if this condition isn't strictly met.\n\n5. There are no other conditions or methods that could change the `isActive` status directly or indirectly without going through the `updateActivity()` method.\n6. The only way `isActive` can be true is if `caloriesBurned > caloriesConsumed`.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that an active status does indeed always mean the person has burned more calories than they have consumed.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Code**:\n   - The `HealthTracker` class keeps track of `caloriesConsumed`, `caloriesBurned`, and an `isActive` flag.\n   - The `eat` method increases `caloriesConsumed`.\n   - The `exercise` method increases `caloriesBurned`.\n   - The `updateActivity` method checks if `caloriesBurned` is greater than `caloriesConsumed`. If so, it sets `isActive` to `true`; otherwise, it sets `isActive` to `false`.\n\n2. **Causal Relationship**:\n   - The relationship given is `caloriesBurned > caloriesConsumed → isActive`.\n   - This means that whenever the number of calories burned exceeds the number of calories consumed, the `isActive` flag is set to `true`.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Question**:\n   - The question asks if an active status (`isActive` being `true`) always means the person has burned more calories than they consumed.\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - According to the code, `isActive` is only set to `true` when `caloriesBurned` is greater than `caloriesConsumed`.\n   - Therefore, if `isActive` is `true`, it must be the case that `caloriesBurned > caloriesConsumed`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the logic implemented in the `updateActivity` method, an active status (`isActive` being `true`) does indeed always mean the person has burned more calories than they consumed.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthTracker` class has two key variables: `caloriesConsumed` and `caloriesBurned`, both of which are integers.\n\n2. The `isActive` variable is a boolean that determines whether the person is considered \"active.\"\n\n3. The `updateActivity()` method is called whenever `eat()` or `exercise()` is called. This method updates the `isActive` status based on the comparison between `caloriesBurned` and `caloriesConsumed`.\n\n4. The `updateActivity()` method sets `isActive` to `true` if `caloriesBurned > caloriesConsumed`. Otherwise, it sets `isActive` to `false`.\n\n5. The question asks if an active status always means the person has burned more calories than they consumed.\n\n6. According to the logic in the `updateActivity()` method, the `isActive` status is directly determined by the comparison `caloriesBurned > caloriesConsumed`.\n\n7. Therefore, if `isActive` is `true`, it must be because `caloriesBurned > caloriesConsumed`.\n\n8. Conversely, if `isActive` is `false`, it must be because `caloriesBurned <= caloriesConsumed`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that an active status does indeed always mean the person has burned more calories than they consumed.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `HealthTracker` class maintains two key attributes:\n   - `caloriesConsumed`: The total calories consumed.\n   - `caloriesBurned`: The total calories burned.\n\n2.

If this condition is true, `isActive` is set to `true`; otherwise, it is set to `false`.\n\n4. This means that for `isActive` to be `true`, the person must have burned more calories than they have consumed.\n\n5. However, the question asks if an active status always means the person has burned more calories than they consumed.\n\n6. From the given logic, we can see that the active status (`isActive`) is directly determined by whether calories burned exceed calories consumed.\n\n7. Therefore, an active status does indeed always mean the person has burned more calories than they have consumed.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Class Structure**: The `HealthTracker` class tracks calories consumed, calories burned, and whether the person is considered \"active.\"\n\n2. **Methods**:\n   - `eat(int calories)`: Increases `caloriesConsumed`.\n   - `exercise(int calories)`: Increases `caloriesBurned`.\n   - `updateActivity()`: Updates the `isActive` status based on the comparison of `caloriesBurned` and `caloriesConsumed`.\n\n3. **Update Activity Logic**:\n   - If `caloriesBurned` is greater than `caloriesConsumed`, `isActive` is set to `true`.\n   - Otherwise, `isActive` is set to `false`.\n\n4. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if an active status (`isActive` being `true`) always means that the person has burned more calories than they consumed.\n\n5. **Causal Relationship**:\n   - According to the code, `isActive` is directly determined by the relationship between `caloriesBurned` and `caloriesConsumed`. Specifically, `isActive` is `true` only when `caloriesBurned > caloriesConsumed`.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the provided logic, an active status (`isActive` being `true`) is exclusively tied to the condition where `caloriesBurned` is greater than `caloriesConsumed`.\n\nTherefore, an active status does always mean the person has burned more calories than they consumed.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `HealthTracker` class to determine if an active status always means the person has burned more calories than they consumed.\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - The `isActive` flag is initialized to `false`.\n\n2. **Methods**:\n   - `eat(int calories)`: This method increases the `caloriesConsumed` by the given amount and then calls `updateActivity()`.\n   - `exercise(int calories)`: This method increases the `caloriesBurned` by the given amount and then calls `updateActivity()`.\n\n3. **updateActivity() Method**:\n   - This method checks if `caloriesBurned` is greater than `caloriesConsumed`. If it is, `isActive` is set to `true`; otherwise, it is set to `false`.\n\n4. **Active Status Logic**:\n   - The `isActive` flag is only set to `true` when `caloriesBurned` exceeds `caloriesConsumed`.
