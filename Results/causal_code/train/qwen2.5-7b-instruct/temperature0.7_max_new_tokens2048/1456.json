However, the reverse is not necessarily true. If 'age' is provided but falls into a range that doesn't specify a risk (e.g., if the age is exactly 50, which would technically fall under the condition for 'low' risk but could be considered ambiguous without explicit rules), the risk might still be set to 'unknown'.\n\nBut based on the given logic, the only way 'risk' can be 'unknown' is if 'age' is not provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
