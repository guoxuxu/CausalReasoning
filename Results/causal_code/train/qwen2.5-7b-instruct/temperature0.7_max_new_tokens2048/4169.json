    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Functions**:\n   - `process_data`: Filters out data points where the value is less than or equal to `filter_threshold`. It then normalizes the remaining values by dividing each by 100.\n   - `analyze_data`: Computes the average of the normalized data.\n\n2. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The initial `filter_threshold` is not specified in the provided code snippet.\n   - Raw data: `[{'value': 150}, {'value': 80}, {'value': 200}]`\n   - With `filter_threshold` set to 100, only the data point with `value` 200 passes the filter.\n   - Normalized data: `[2.0]`\n   - Analysis: `{'average': 2.0}`\n\n3. **Effect of Changing `filter_threshold`**:\n   - If we increase `filter_threshold`, fewer data points will pass the filter, and the resulting normalized values will be smaller (since they are divided by 100).\n   - If we decrease `filter_threshold`, more data points will pass the filter, potentially leading to larger normalized values and thus a higher average.\n\n4. **Determining Decrease in Average**:\n   - A decrease in the average value could indicate that the number of data points passing the filter increased, which would typically happen if the `filter_threshold` was lowered.\n   - However, it's also possible that the decrease could be due to other factors, such as changes in the actual values of the data points themselves.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While a decrease in the average can suggest that the `filter_threshold` might have been lowered, it does not provide enough information to definitively infer the exact change in `filter_threshold`.\n   - There could be multiple scenarios that lead to a decrease in the average without changing the `filter_threshold`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nWe cannot definitively infer a specific modification in the `filter_threshold` based solely on the decrease in the 'average' result from `analyze_data`.",
