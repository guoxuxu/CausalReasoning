    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `SalesData` class has a property `inflationRate` which is set to 0.03 by default.\n\n2. The `applyInflation` method multiplies each sales figure by `(1 + this.inflationRate)`.\n\n3. If we increase the `inflationRate`, for example to 0.05, the formula used in `applyInflation` becomes:\n   - `this.salesFigures[month] *= (1 + 0.05);`\n\n4. This means that each sales figure will be multiplied by a larger factor when the inflation rate is increased.\n\n5. Multiplying any number greater than 1 (like 1.05 for a 5% increase) will result in a larger number, indicating an increase in the sales figure after applying inflation.\n\n6.
