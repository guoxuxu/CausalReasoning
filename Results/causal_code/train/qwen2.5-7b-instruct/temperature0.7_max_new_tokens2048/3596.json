    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We have a function `stimulate_sales` that calculates sales based on investment and a seasonal factor.\n   - The initial values are:\n     - `investment = 300`\n     - `seasonal_factor = 1.2`\n     - `expected_sales = 500`\n\n2. **Current Sales Calculation**:\n   - Base sales = 100\n   - Sales increase due to investment = 0.5 * investment = 0.5 * 300 = 150\n   - Seasonal sales = base_sales + sales_increase * seasonal_factor = 100 + 150 * 1.2 = 100 + 180 = 280\n\n3. **Adjusting Marketing Budget**:\n   - Since current_sales (280) is less than expected_sales (500), the marketing budget is adjusted to:\n     - New budget = current_sales * 1.2 = 280 * 1.2 = 336\n\n4. **Effect of Additional Marketing Strategy**:\n   - If we implement an additional marketing strategy that multiplies the seasonal factor, the new seasonal factor would be 1.2 * some multiplier (let's call it `multiplier`).\n\n5. **New Sales Calculation with Multiplied Seasonal Factor**:\n   - Let's assume the multiplier is 1.5 (a reasonable assumption to check for a significant boost).\n   - New seasonal factor = 1.2 * 1.5 = 1.8\n   - New sales = base_sales + sales_increase * new_seasonal_factor = 100 + 150 * 1.8 = 100 + 270 = 370\n\n6. **Comparison**:\n   - Without the additional strategy, the sales were 280.\n   - With the additional strategy, the sales are projected to be 370.\n\nGiven this calculation, the additional marketing strategy does indeed boost `current_sales` significantly from 280 to 370, which is a notable increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
