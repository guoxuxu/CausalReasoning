    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `calculateCropYield` method sets the `cropYield` based on two conditions:\n   - Rainfall > 50mm AND fertilizer was applied: `cropYield = 100`\n   - Rainfall > 50mm AND no fertilizer applied: `cropYield = 80`\n   - Fertilizer applied AND rainfall <= 50mm: `cropYield = 60`\n   - No fertilizer applied AND rainfall <= 50mm: `cropYield = 30`\n\n2. We are given that the `cropYield` is 100.\n\n3. Looking at the conditions where `cropYield` is set to 100:\n   - It explicitly states that both rainfall must be greater than 50mm AND fertilizer must have been applied.\n\n4. There are no other conditions where `cropYield` could be 100 without both of these conditions being met.\n\nTherefore, if the `cropYield` was 100, we can infer that both rainfall was greater than 50mm and fertilizer was applied.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `calculateCropYield` method sets the `cropYield` based on two factors: `rainfall` and `fertilizerApplied`.\n\n2. We need to check the conditions under which `cropYield` is set to 100.\n\n3. Looking at the code, we see that `cropYield` is set to 100 only when:\n   - `rainfall > 50` AND `fertilizerApplied == true`\n\n4. If either of these conditions is not met, `cropYield` will be set to a different value.\n\n5. Since we know that `cropYield` is 100, it must be due to the specific condition where both `rainfall > 50` and `fertilizerApplied` is true.\n\nTherefore, if the crop yield was 100, we can indeed infer that both rainfall was greater than 50mm and fertilizer was applied without observing them directly.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `calculateCropYield` method sets the `cropYield` based on two factors: rainfall and whether fertilizer has been applied.\n\n2. If `cropYield` is set to 100, according to the logic in `calculateCropYield`, this means:\n   - `rainfall > 50`\n   - AND `fertilizerApplied` is `true`\n\n3. This is because the only condition where `cropYield` is explicitly set to 100 is when both `rainfall > 50` and `fertilizerApplied` are true.\n\n4. We don't need to check other conditions because they do not result in a `cropYield` of 100.\n\nTherefore, if the `cropYield` is 100, we can indeed infer that both `rainfall` was greater than 50mm and `fertilizer` was applied.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
