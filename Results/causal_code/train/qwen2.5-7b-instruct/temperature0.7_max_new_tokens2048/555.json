    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the formula**: The health risk is calculated as `health_risk = (age * 0.2 + weight * 0.5) - exercise_hours * 2`.\n\n2. **Identify the 'Medium Risk' range**: A person is categorized as 'Medium Risk' if `20 <= health_risk <= 50`.\n\n3. **Analyze the impact of increasing exercise hours**:\n   - Increasing exercise hours will decrease the overall value of `health_risk` because the term `- exercise_hours * 2` is subtracted from the sum of `(age * 0.2 + weight * 0.5)`.\n   - Therefore, more exercise will reduce the health risk score.\n\n4. **Determine the new risk category**:\n   - If a person is currently at the boundary of 'Medium Risk' (i.e., `health_risk = 20`), increasing exercise hours will reduce this score below 20, moving them into the 'Low Risk' category.\n   - For any value within the 'Medium Risk' range (e.g., 21, 22, ..., 49), increasing exercise hours will also lower the score, potentially bringing it down to 20 or below.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if one increases the exercise hours of a person who is in the 'Medium Risk' bracket, it is indeed likely that their risk category would change to 'Low Risk'.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

A person is in the 'Medium Risk' bracket when:\n   \\[\n   20 \\leq \\text{health\\_risk} \\leq 50\n   \\]\n\n3. To move from 'Medium Risk' to 'Low Risk', the `health_risk` must be less than 20.\n\n4. Let's consider how increasing `exercise_hours` affects the `health_risk`:\n   - Increasing `exercise_hours` decreases the value of \\(-exercise_hours \\times 2\\), which means the overall `health_risk` will decrease.\n\n5. For a significant enough increase in `exercise_hours`, the `health_risk` can indeed drop below 20, moving the person from 'Medium Risk' to 'Low Risk'.\n\n6. However, the exact amount of increase needed depends on the specific values of `age` and `weight`. Without knowing these values, we cannot definitively say whether any increase will definitely push the `health_risk` below 20.\n\nGiven this analysis, while it is possible to move from 'Medium Risk' to 'Low Risk' by increasing `exercise_hours`, it is not guaranteed without more specific information about the individual's age and weight.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\nThe likelihood is high but not certain based on the provided information alone.",

Therefore, adding more exercise will reduce the value of `health_risk`.\n\n4. **Determining the New Risk Category**:\n   - If the current `health_risk` is exactly 50, increasing `exercise_hours` will make it less than 50.\n   - If the current `health_risk` is between 20 and 50, increasing `exercise_hours` will bring it closer to 20.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Since increasing `exercise_hours` will lower the `health_risk`, and the 'Low Risk' category is defined as `health_risk < 20`, it is very likely that an increase in exercise hours will shift someone from 'Medium Risk' to 'Low Risk'.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
