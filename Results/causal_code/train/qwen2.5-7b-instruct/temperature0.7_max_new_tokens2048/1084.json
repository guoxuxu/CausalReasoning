  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Setting the season to 'summer' causes the temperature to range between 80 and 100 degrees, which leads to choosing 'swimming' as the activity due to temperatures being above 75.",
  "causal_map": "season → temperature; temperature → activity",
  "causal_map_integration": "In summer, the temperature increases, which leads to swimming as the most likely activity.",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The `season` variable is set to either 'summer' or 'winter' randomly.\n2. For the summer case, we need to check the temperature range:\n   - The `calculate_temperature` function returns a value between 80 and 100 for summer.\n3. The `decide_activity` function decides the activity based on the temperature:\n   - If the temperature is greater than 75, it returns 'swimming'.\n   - Otherwise, it returns 'skiing'.\n\nGiven that the temperature in summer is between 80 and 100, which is always greater than 75, the `decide_activity` function will always return 'swimming'.\n\nTherefore, if the season is set to 'summer', the activity will most likely be 'swimming'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
