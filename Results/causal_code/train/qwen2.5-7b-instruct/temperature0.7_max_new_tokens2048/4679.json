    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - `age` is greater than 50.\n   - `smoker` is False (non-smoker).\n   - `activity_level` is 'high'.\n\n2. **Calculate Risk Factor**:\n   - Since the person is not a smoker (`smoker = False`), the initial `risk_factor` is set to 1.\n   - The age is greater than 50, so we multiply the `risk_factor` by 1.5, resulting in `risk_factor = 1 * 1.5 = 1.5`.\n   - The `activity_level` is 'high', so we multiply the `risk_factor` by 0.8, resulting in `risk_factor = 1.5 * 0.8 = 1.2`.\n\n3. **Determine Risk Category**:\n   - The calculated `risk_factor` is 1.2, which is less than 2.5.\n   - Therefore, the initial risk category is 'low-risk'.\n\n4. **Change in Age Only**:\n   - If only the `age` increases beyond 50 (while keeping the other conditions the same), the `risk_factor` will still be calculated as follows:\n     - `risk_factor` starts at 1.\n     - The age is greater than 50, so we multiply the `risk_factor` by 1.5, resulting in `risk_factor = 1 * 1.5 = 1.5`.\n     - The `activity_level` remains 'high', so we multiply the `risk_factor` by 0.8, resulting in `risk_factor = 1.5 * 0.8 = 1.2`.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - The `risk_factor` remains 1.2 even after increasing the age beyond 50.\n   - Since 1.2 is still less than 2.5, the risk category remains 'low-risk'.\n\nTherefore, the risk category does not change from 'low-risk' to 'high-risk' when only the age increases beyond 50.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - Age: Let's assume an initial age where it is not greater than 50 (so no multiplier applied yet).\n   - Smoker: No (so `risk_factor = 1`).\n   - Activity Level: High (so `risk_factor *= 0.8`).\n\n2. **Risk Factor Calculation for Initial Conditions**:\n   - Since the person is a non-smoker (`smoker = False`), `risk_factor = 1`.\n   - The activity level is high, so `risk_factor *= 0.8`, resulting in `risk_factor = 1 * 0.8 = 0.8`.\n\n3. **Age Increase Beyond 50**:\n   - When the age increases beyond 50, the `risk_factor` is multiplied by 1.5.\n   - So, `risk_factor = 0.8 * 1.5 = 1.2`.\n\n4. **Final Risk Category Check**:\n   - The function checks if `risk_factor > 2.5` to determine the risk category.\n   - Here, `risk_factor = 1.2`, which is less than 2.5.\n\nTherefore, even after increasing the age beyond 50, the risk factor remains below the threshold that would classify it as 'high-risk'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
