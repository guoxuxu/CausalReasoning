    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_discount` takes three parameters: `prices`, `discount_rate`, and `is_member`.\n\n2. If `is_member` is `True`, the function adds an additional 5% to the `discount_rate`.\n\n3. In the given scenario, `is_member` is initially set to `True`. This means the `discount_rate` becomes `0.1 + 0.05 = 0.15` (15%).\n\n4. The function then calculates the discounted prices by applying the formula `price * (1 - discount_rate)` to each item in the `prices` list.\n\n5. Now, let's consider what happens if `is_member` is set to `False`:\n   - Without the additional 5%, the `discount_rate` remains at `0.1` (10%).\n\n6. A 10% discount (0.1) is less than a 15% discount (0.15).\n\n7. When we apply a smaller discount rate (10%) to the original prices, the resulting prices will be higher compared to applying a larger discount rate (15%).\n\nTherefore, if `is_member` is set to `False`, the `discounted_prices` will indeed be higher.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If `is_member` is `True`, it adds an additional 5% to the `discount_rate`. So, if `is_member` is `False`, the `discount_rate` remains at 10%.\n\n3. The formula used to calculate the discounted price for each item in the list is `price * (1 - discount_rate)`.\n\n4. If `is_member` is `False`:\n   - The `discount_rate` is 10%.\n   - Each price in the list will be multiplied by `(1 - 0.10)`, which equals 0.90.\n\n5. If `is_member` is `True`:\n   - The `discount_rate` becomes 15% (10% + 5%).\n   - Each price in the list will be multiplied by `(1 - 0.15)`, which equals 0.85.\n\n6. Comparing the two scenarios:\n   - When `is_member` is `False`, the prices are reduced by 10%.\n   - When `is_member` is `True`, the prices are reduced by 15%.\n\n7. Since 0.85 (15% off) is less than 0.90 (10% off), the prices after applying the discount will be lower when `is_member` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, if `is_member` is set to `False`, the `discounted_prices` will be higher compared to when `is_member` is `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1.

If `is_member` is `True`, the function adds an additional 5% to the `discount_rate`.\n\n3. The function then calculates the discounted prices for each item in the `prices` list using the formula:\n   \\[ \\text{discounted\\_price} = \\text{price} \\times (1 - \\text{discount\\_rate}) \\]\n\n4. Now, let's consider what happens when `is_member` is `False`:\n   - The `discount_rate` remains at its original value of 10% (or 0.1).\n   - No additional 5% discount is added.\n\n5. When `is_member` is `True`, the effective discount rate becomes 15% (10% + 5%), leading to a greater reduction in price.\n\n6. Since the discount rate is higher when `is_member` is `True`, the resulting `discounted_prices` will be lower than if `is_member` were `False`.\n\nTherefore, if `is_member` is set to `False`, the `discounted_prices` will not be higher; they will actually be lower.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

A 10% discount results in a higher price than a 15% discount. For example:\n   - With a 15% discount: $100 * (1 - 0.15) = $85\n   - With a 10% discount: $100 * (1 - 0.10) = $90\n\n7. Therefore, if `is_member` is `False`, the `discount_rate` would be lower, resulting in a higher final price for each item in the list.\n\nBased on this reasoning, if `is_member` is set to `False`, the `discounted_prices` will indeed be higher.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

If `is_member` is `True`, the function adds an additional 5% to the `discount_rate`.\n\n3. The function then calculates the discounted prices for each item in the `prices` list using the formula:\n   ```python\n   discounted_price = price * (1 - discount_rate)\n   ```\n\n4. Now, let's consider what happens when `is_member` is `False`:\n   - The `discount_rate` remains at its initial value of 10% (0.1).\n   - No additional 5% discount is added.\n   - Therefore, the discounted price calculation remains:\n     ```python\n     discounted_price = price * (1 - 0.1) = price * 0.9\n     ```\n\n5.

Since 0.9 > 0.85, the prices after applying the 10% discount without membership will be higher than the prices after applying the 15% discount with membership.\n\nTherefore, if `is_member` is set to `False`, the `discounted_prices` will indeed be higher compared to when `is_member` is `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
