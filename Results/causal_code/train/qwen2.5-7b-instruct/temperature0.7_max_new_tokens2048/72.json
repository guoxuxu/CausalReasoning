    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `compute_stats` function calculates the mean and variance of the input data.\n2. The variance is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n3. If the variance is greater than 15, the program prints 'High variance'.\n4. We need to determine if we can uniquely identify the values in `input_data` based on the condition that the printed output is 'High variance'.\n\nTo uniquely identify the values in `input_data`, we would need to know exactly which set of numbers, when passed to `compute_stats`, would result in a variance greater than 15.\n\nHowever, there are multiple sets of numbers that could produce a variance greater than 15. For example:\n- A dataset with a wide range of values (like [1, 100, 101, 102, 103]) might have a high variance.\n- A dataset with some extreme outliers (like [1, 10, 1000, 1001, 1002]) could also have a high variance.\n- Any dataset where the spread of values is significant could potentially result in a variance greater than 15.\n\nGiven this, we cannot uniquely determine the specific values in `input_data` just from knowing that the variance is greater than 15.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

For the given `input_data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, we can calculate the mean and variance manually to verify the logic.\n\nMean calculation:\n\\[ \\text{mean} = \\frac{10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50}{5} = \\frac{150}{5} = 30 \\]\n\nVariance calculation:\n\\[ \\text{square_diffs} = [(10-30)^2, (20-30)^2, (30-30)^2, (40-30)^2, (50-30)^2] \\]\n\\[ \\text{square_diffs} = [400, 100, 0, 100, 400] \\]\n\\[ \\text{variance} = \\frac{400 + 100 + 0 + 100 + 400}{5} = \\frac{1000}{5} = 200 \\]\n\n3.
