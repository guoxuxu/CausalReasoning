  "Explanation": "The process_data function returns 'High' if the result, derived from the compute_score function, is greater than 50, not 70. The compute_score function sets returned scores at 80 if the input normalized value is more than 70 and 40 otherwise. Therefore, a result being 'High' means compute_score returned 80, which requires the normalized score to exceed 70, aligning with the condition for a return of 'High', but the direct raw score requirement for higher than 70 as a raw score isn't necessary.",
