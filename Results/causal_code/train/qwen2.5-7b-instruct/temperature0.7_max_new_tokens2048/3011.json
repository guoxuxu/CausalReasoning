The condition for setting 'status' to 'adult' is explicitly stated as:\n   - `'age' in data and data['age'] > 18`\n\n3. We need to determine if 'status' being 'adult' implies that 'age' was greater than 18.\n\n4. By the logic of the function:\n   - If 'age' is greater than 18, then 'status' will be set to 'adult'.\n   - However, if 'age' is not greater than 18 (i.e., 'age' is less than or equal to 18), 'status' will be set to 'minor', regardless of the value of 'income'.\n\n5. Therefore, if 'status' is 'adult', it must be because 'age' was indeed greater than 18, as per the direct condition provided in the function.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that if 'status' is 'adult', it does imply that 'age' was greater than 18.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
