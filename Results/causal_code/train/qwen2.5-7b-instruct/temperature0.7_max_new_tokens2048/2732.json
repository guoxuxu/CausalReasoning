    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - Temperature is 35 (which is greater than 30).\n   - Humidity is set to 60.\n\n2. **Check the Temperature Condition**:\n   - Since the temperature is greater than 30, we need to check the humidity condition.\n\n3. **Check the Humidity Condition**:\n   - The code states that if `self.temperature > 30` and `self.humidity < 50`, then `self.weather_condition` is set to 'Hot'.\n   - In this case, the humidity is 60, which is not less than 50.\n\n4. **Determine the Weather Condition**:\n   - Since the humidity is not less than 50, the condition `self.weather_condition = 'Hot'` does not apply.\n   - Instead, the code should default to setting the weather condition based on the temperature alone, which would be 'Hot' since the temperature is greater than 30.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the weather condition will remain 'Hot' rather than changing to 'Humid'.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial conditions are:\n   - Temperature = 35 (which is greater than 30)\n   - Humidity = unknown (but we know it will be set to 60)\n\n2. According to the `update_weather` method:\n   - If temperature > 30, the weather condition depends on humidity.\n   - Specifically, if humidity < 50, the condition is 'Hot'.\n   - Otherwise, if humidity >= 50, the condition is 'Humid'.\n\n3. In this scenario:\n   - The temperature is 35, which is greater than 30.\n   - The humidity is being set to 60.\n\n4. Since the humidity is now 60 (which is >= 50), based on the logic in `update_weather`, the weather condition will change to 'Humid'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Given that the new humidity is set to 60 (which is >= 50) and the temperature is 35 (which is > 30), we can apply the logic from point 2.\n\n4.
