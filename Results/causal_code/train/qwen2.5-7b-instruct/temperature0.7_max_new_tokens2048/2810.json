    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `analyze_sales` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. It checks two conditions:\n   - If `data['promotion']` is True and `data['season']` is 'Summer', it sets `sales_increase` to 15.\n   - If `data['promotion']` is True but `data['season']` is not 'Summer', it sets `sales_increase` to 10.\n3. If `data['promotion']` is False (i.e., it's not True), it sets `sales_increase` to 5 regardless of the season.\n4. Finally, it calculates `final_sales` as `data['initial_sales'] + sales_increase`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `data['promotion']` is set to True:\n\n- If `data['season']` is 'Summer', then `sales_increase` is set to 15.\n- If `data['season']` is not 'Summer', then `sales_increase` is set to 10.\n\nIn both cases, when `data['promotion']` is True, `sales_increase` is either 15 or 10, which is greater than 5.
