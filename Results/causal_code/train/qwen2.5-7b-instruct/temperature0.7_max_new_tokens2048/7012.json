    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The function `compute_score` takes three parameters: `health_index`, `environment_factor`, and `genetic_factor`.\n   - The base score is set to 50.\n\n2. **Adjusted Health Score Calculation**:\n   - The adjusted health score is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{adjusted\\_health\\_score} = \\text{base\\_score} + (\\text{health\\_index} \\times 10) - (\\text{environment\\_factor} \\times 5)\n     \\]\n   - If we set `environment_factor` to zero, the formula simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{adjusted\\_health\\_score} = 50 + (\\text{health\\_index} \\times 10)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Score Calculation**:\n   - The final score is then calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_score} = \\text{adjusted\\_health\\_score} + (\\text{genetic\\_factor} \\times 15)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the simplified formula for `adjusted_health_score`:\n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_score} = (50 + (\\text{health\\_index} \\times 10)) + (\\text{genetic\\_factor} \\times 15)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying further:\n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_score} = 50 + (\\text{health\\_index} \\times 10) + (\\text{genetic\\_factor} \\times 15)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Effect of Increasing Health Index**:\n   - If we increase the `health_index`, the term \\((\\text{health\\_index} \\times 10)\\) will increase.\n   - Since this term is directly added to the base score, increasing `health_index` will directly increase the final score.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, an increase in `health_index` would indeed increase the final score when `environment_factor` is controlled to zero.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
