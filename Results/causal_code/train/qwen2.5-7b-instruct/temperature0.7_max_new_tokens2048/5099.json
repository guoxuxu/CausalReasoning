So, the total discount is just the seasonal discount, which depends on the price being greater than 100.\n- When the customer type becomes 'loyal', the base discount is now 0.1. This increases the total discount by 0.1 regardless of the seasonal discount.\n\nSince the base discount is added to any existing seasonal discount, changing the customer type to 'loyal' will always increase the total discount, assuming the customer type was not already 'loyal'. This means the discounted price will decrease because the price is reduced by a larger amount due to the additional base discount.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThe discounted price will not decrease; it will actually decrease further when the customer type changes to 'loyal'.",
