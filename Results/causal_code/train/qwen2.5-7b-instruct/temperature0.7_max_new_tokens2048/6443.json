    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Key Components**: \n   - We need to know what the `insert_data` function does.\n   - We need to understand how the `results` variable is used.\n\n2. **Assumptions**:\n   - Without the actual code, we can only reason based on typical usage patterns.\n   - The `results` variable is likely initialized somewhere in the code (e.g., as an empty list or dictionary).\n   - The `insert_data` function is presumably responsible for populating the `results` variable with data.\n\n3. **Reasoning**:\n   - If `insert_data` is never called, it means that no data is being inserted into the `results` variable.\n   - If `results` is not modified after its initial assignment, it will remain in its initial state.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - If `results` is initialized as an empty container (e.g., `results = []` or `results = {}`) and `insert_data` is never called, then `results` will indeed remain empty.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The question asks if 'results' will remain empty if the 'insert_data' function is never called.\n\n2. To determine this, we need to understand where 'results' is initialized and how it is affected by the 'insert_data' function.\n\n3. Without seeing the actual code, we can make some assumptions based on common programming practices:\n   - 'results' is likely an empty list or some other data structure that gets populated by the 'insert_data' function.\n   - If 'insert_data' is not called, there would be no mechanism to populate 'results'.\n\n4. Let's consider two scenarios:\n   - Scenario A: 'results' is initialized as an empty list or similar at the start of the program.\n   - Scenario B: 'results' is not initialized at all, or is initialized to something other than an empty list.\n\n5. In Scenario A, if 'insert_data' is never called, 'results' will indeed remain empty because nothing will add items to it.\n\n6. In Scenario B, even if 'insert_data' is never called, 'results' might still have some initial value (e.g., None, an empty string, etc.), but for the purpose of this question, we can consider it \"empty\" in the context of containing no useful data.\n\n7. Given the typical use case of such functions, we can reasonably assume that 'results' is initialized as an empty list or similar.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, if 'insert_data' is never called, 'results' will remain empty.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to understand what 'results' is and how it's affected by the 'insert_data' function.\n\n2. Typically, 'results' would be a variable that stores data after calling 'insert_data'.\n\n3. If 'insert_data' is never called, there's no action that populates 'results'.\n\n4. The question asks if 'results' will remain empty as a result of 'insert_data' not being called.\n\n5. By default, if 'results' is not explicitly initialized elsewhere in the code, it might be None or an empty list/dictionary depending on its declaration.\n\n6. If 'results' is initialized as an empty container (like a list or dictionary) and 'insert_data' is never called to add any elements, then 'results' will indeed remain empty.\n\n7. However, if 'results' is declared without an initial value (e.g., just `results = []`), and 'insert_data' is never called, 'results' will still be an empty list, which can be considered \"empty\" in this context.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if we assume 'results' is typically initialized as an empty container and 'insert_data' is never called, 'results' will indeed remain empty.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Typically, 'results' would be a variable used to store data after it has been inserted by the 'insert_data' function.\n\n3. If 'insert_data' is never called, there's no way for any data to be inserted into 'results'.\n\n4. The initial state of 'results' is not specified in the question, but typically it could be an empty list, tuple, dictionary, or set depending on the context.\n\n5. Without any data being inserted via 'insert_data', 'results' will remain in its initial state.\n\n6. Therefore, if 'insert_data' is never called, 'results' will indeed remain empty (or whatever its initial state was).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We need to consider the context of the `results` variable and how it might be populated.\n\n2. Typically, `results` would be populated within the `insert_data` function if that function performs an operation that adds data to `results`.\n\n3. The question states that the `insert_data` function is never called. This means that there is no execution path where `results` could be modified or populated.\n\n4. If `results` is not modified after its initial state (which is typically an empty list or some other default value), it will remain in that initial state.\n\n5. Therefore, without any calls to `insert_data`, `results` will indeed remain empty.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
