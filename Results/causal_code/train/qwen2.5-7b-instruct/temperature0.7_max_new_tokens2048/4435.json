    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `perform_magic` takes one parameter, `show_favorite`.\n\n2. If `show_favorite` is `True`, the function does the following:\n   - Sets `magic_number` to 5.\n   - Multiplies `magic_number` by 2, resulting in 10.\n   - Adds a random number between 1 and 5 to `magic_number`.\n   - Adds 10 to the updated `magic_number`.\n\n3. If `show_favorite` is `False`, the function does the following:\n   - Sets `magic_number` to 5.\n   - Multiplies `magic_number` by 2, resulting in 10.\n   - Skips the line that adds a random number (since `show_favorite` is `False`).\n   - Adds 10 to the `magic_number`.\n\n4. Therefore, when `show_favorite` is `False`, the calculation is:\n   - `magic_number` = 5\n   - `result = magic_number * 2` → `result = 10`\n   - `result = magic_number + 10` → `result = 20`\n\n5. This means that when `show_favorite` is `False`, `final_score` will always be 20.\n\n6. Since `favorite_shown` is set to `True` in the provided code, we don't need to consider the `False` case for this specific scenario, but it doesn't affect the logic of our answer.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if `show_favorite` is set to `False`, `final_score` will always be the same (20).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `perform_magic` takes one parameter, `show_favorite`, which is a boolean.\n\n2. If `show_favorite` is True (as it is in this case), the function performs the following steps:\n   - Sets `magic_number` to 5.\n   - Multiplies `magic_number` by 2, resulting in `result` being 10.\n   - Adds a random integer between 1 and 5 to `magic_number`.\n   - Adds 10 to the updated `magic_number`, resulting in the final `result`.\n\n3. If `show_favorite` is False, the function skips the line that adds a random number to `magic_number`.\n\n4. Let's examine what happens when `show_favorite` is False:\n   - `magic_number` is still set to 5.\n   - `result` is set to `magic_number * 2`, which is 10.\n   - Since `show_favorite` is False, no random number is added to `magic_number`.\n   - `result` is then incremented by 10, making the final `result` 20.\n\n5. Therefore, when `show_favorite` is False, `final_score` will always be 20.\n\n6. However, the question asks if `final_score` will always be the same regardless of whether `show_favorite` is set to False or not. \n\n7. We know from the original scenario where `favorite_shown` is True, `final_score` can vary because of the random addition.\n\n8. Thus, setting `show_favorite` to False does make `final_score` consistent, but it doesn't make it the same as when `show_favorite` is True.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

If `show_favorite` is False:\n   - The same initial steps occur: `magic_number` is 5, `result` is 10.\n   - However, since `show_favorite` is False, the line that increments `magic_number` by a random value is skipped.\n   - Therefore, `result` remains at 10 + 10, which is 20.\n\n4. The question asks if `final_score` will always be the same when `show_favorite` is set to False.\n\n5. Based on our reasoning, when `show_favorite` is False, `final_score` is always 20 because no randomness is introduced.\n\n6. Since `final_score` is consistently 20 when `show_favorite` is False, it meets the criteria of being the same every time.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If `show_favorite` is False, the function would skip the line that adds the random number and proceed directly to adding 10 to the initial `magic_number` of 5.\n\n4. Let's calculate the result when `show_favorite` is False:\n   - `magic_number` starts at 5.\n   - 10 is added to `magic_number`, resulting in 15.\n\n5.

We can see that when `show_favorite` is False, the final score is always 15.\n\n7. However, when `show_favorite` is True, the final score can vary between 21 and 25 due to the addition of the random number.\n\n8. Since the final score varies when `show_favorite` is True but is fixed at 15 when `show_favorite` is False, we can conclude that 'final_score' will not always be the same if 'show_favorite' is set to False.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
