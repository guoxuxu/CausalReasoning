    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditions:**\n   - If `data['promotion']` is `True` and `data['season']` is `'Summer'`, then `sales_increase` will be 15.\n   - If `data['promotion']` is `True` but `data['season']` is not `'Summer'`, then `sales_increase` will be 10.\n   - If `data['promotion']` is `False`, regardless of the season, `sales_increase` will be 5.\n\n2. **Final Sales Calculation:**\n   - The final sales value is calculated as `data['initial_sales'] + sales_increase`.\n\n3. **Given Information:**\n   - We observe an increase of 5 units in `final_sales`.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Given Increase:**\n   - An increase of 5 units in `final_sales` means that `sales_increase` must have been 5.\n   - According to the conditions, `sales_increase` is 5 only when `data['promotion']` is `False`.\n\nTherefore, if we see an increase of 5 units in `final_sales`, it implies that no promotion was active.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nThis indicates that we can indeed determine if a promotion was active or not based on the observed increase in `final_sales`.",

This means there is no additional sales increase beyond the base value due to promotions.\n\nSince an increase of 5 units corresponds directly to the case where no promotion is active (and thus no additional sales increase), we cannot infer whether a promotion was active or not based solely on the observed increase of 5 units. The increase of 5 units could also correspond to a situation where a promotion was not active, and it could be the base increase without any promotional effect.\n\nTherefore, with only the observed increase of 5 units, we cannot definitively determine if a promotion was active or not.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
