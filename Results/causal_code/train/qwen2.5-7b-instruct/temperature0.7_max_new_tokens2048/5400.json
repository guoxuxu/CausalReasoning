    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `Thermostat` class has three key variables:\n   - `desiredTemperature`: The temperature the thermostat aims for.\n   - `externalTemperature`: The current temperature outside.\n   - `systemOn`: A flag indicating whether the heating/cooling system is on.\n\n2. The `updateExternalTemp` method updates the `externalTemperature` and then calls `adjustSystem()`.\n\n3. The `adjustSystem` method checks two conditions:\n   - If `externalTemperature < desiredTemperature` and `systemOn` is false, it turns the system on.\n   - If `externalTemperature > desiredTemperature` and `systemOn` is true, it turns the system off.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's consider what happens when the system switches to \"on\":\n\n- For the system to turn on, the condition `externalTemperature < desiredTemperature && !systemOn` must be true.\n- This means that at the time of checking, the `externalTemperature` is below the `desiredTemperature` AND the system was not already on.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that the `externalTemperature` is below the `desiredTemperature` **without any other observations**.\n\nThe answer is no, because there could be scenarios where the system might switch on even if `externalTemperature` is above the `desiredTemperature` but the system was previously off (due to some previous change in `externalTemperature` that made it go below `desiredTemperature`).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `adjustSystem` method is called whenever `updateExternalTemp` is invoked.\n2. The `adjustSystem` method checks two conditions:\n   - If `externalTemperature < desiredTemperature` and `systemOn` is false, it sets `systemOn` to true.\n   - If `externalTemperature > desiredTemperature` and `systemOn` is true, it sets `systemOn` to false.\n\n3. We are asked if we can infer that the `externalTemperature` is below the `desiredTemperature` when the system switches to \"on\".\n\n4. From the logic of the `adjustSystem` method:\n   - For `systemOn` to become true (the system switching to \"on\"), the first condition must be met: `externalTemperature < desiredTemperature` AND `systemOn` is currently false.\n   - The second condition (`externalTemperature > desiredTemperature`) does not change the state from off to on; it only turns the system off if it was previously on.\n\n5. Therefore, if the system switches to \"on\", we can indeed infer that at the moment of switching, the `externalTemperature` was below the `desiredTemperature` and the system was previously off.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `Thermostat` class has properties for `desiredTemperature`, `externalTemperature`, and `systemOn`.\n\n2.

The `adjustSystem` method checks two conditions:\n   - If `externalTemperature < desiredTemperature` AND `systemOn` is false, it sets `systemOn` to true.\n   - If `externalTemperature > desiredTemperature` AND `systemOn` is true, it sets `systemOn` to false.\n\n4. We need to determine if the system being switched to \"on\" means we can infer that `externalTemperature` is below `desiredTemperature` without any other observations.\n\n5. From the logic in `adjustSystem`, we see that the only way to turn `systemOn` to true (i.e., switch the system to \"on\") is when `externalTemperature < desiredTemperature` and the system was previously off (`systemOn` was false).\n\n6. However, there's another condition that can also set `systemOn` to true: if `externalTemperature` becomes greater than `desiredTemperature` while the system is already on. In this case, the system would be turned off instead of on.\n\n7. Therefore, just knowing that the system is switched to \"on\" does not necessarily mean that `externalTemperature` is below `desiredTemperature`.

The `Thermostat` class has two key variables:\n   - `desiredTemperature`: The temperature set by the user.\n   - `externalTemperature`: The current actual temperature outside.\n\n2. The system (heating/cooling) is controlled by the `systemOn` boolean:\n   - `systemOn` is initially false when the thermostat is first created.\n   - It is turned on when `externalTemperature < desiredTemperature` and it was previously off (`!systemOn`).\n   - It is turned off when `externalTemperature > desiredTemperature` and it was previously on (`systemOn`).\n\n3.

If the system is on, then according to the logic in the `adjustSystem()` method:\n   - The condition for turning the system on is `externalTemperature < desiredTemperature && !systemOn`.\n   - This directly states that when the system is on, the external temperature must be less than the desired temperature AND the system was previously off.\n\n5.
