    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Current Behavior of `alertStatus` Method**:\n   - The current `alertStatus` method checks the value of `active`.\n   - If `active` is `true`, it prints \"System is active.\"\n   - If `active` is `false`, it prints \"System is inactive.\"\n\n2. **Proposed Modification**:\n   - We want to modify the `alertStatus` method so that it always prints \"System is active.\" regardless of the value of `active`.\n\n3. **Effect of Modification on `activate` Method**:\n   - When `activate()` is called, it sets `active` to `true` and then calls `alertStatus()`.\n   - With the proposed modification, `alertStatus()` will always print \"System is active.\" because we're hardcoding the message.\n\n4. **Final Output**:\n   - After modifying `alertStatus`, calling `activate()` will set `active` to `true` and then call `alertStatus()`, which will print \"System is active.\".\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

In the proposed modification, `alertStatus` is changed to always print \"System is active.\" regardless of the value of `active`.\n\n4. When `activate` is called:\n   - It sets `active` to true.\n   - Then it calls `alertStatus`.\n\n5.
