    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `stimulate_sales` calculates the `current_sales` based on the `investment` and `seasonal_factor`.\n\n2.

If we increase the `investment`, the value of `sales_increase` will also increase because it is directly proportional to the `investment`.\n\n5. Since `current_sales` is composed of `base_sales` (which remains constant) plus `sales_increase` multiplied by `seasonal_factor`, an increase in `sales_increase` will lead to an increase in `current_sales`.\n\nTherefore, increasing the `investment` while keeping the `seasonal_factor` constant will indeed result in an increase in `current_sales`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `stimulate_sales` calculates `current_sales` based on `investment` and `seasonal_factor`.\n\n2. The formula for `current_sales` is:\n   - `base_sales = 100`\n   - `sales_increase = 0.5 * investment`\n   - `current_sales = base_sales + sales_increase * seasonal_factor`\n\n3. From this formula, we can see that `current_sales` directly depends on `investment`. Specifically, `sales_increase` is calculated as `0.5 * investment`, which means that increasing `investment` will increase `sales_increase`.\n\n4. Since `current_sales` is the sum of `base_sales` (which is constant) and `sales_increase * seasonal_factor`, any increase in `investment` will lead to an increase in `sales_increase`, and consequently, an increase in `current_sales`.\n\nTherefore, if we increase the `investment` while keeping the `seasonal_factor` constant, `current_sales` will indeed increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The key point here is that `sales_increase` directly depends on `investment`. Specifically, `sales_increase = 0.5 * investment`.\n\n4. If we increase `investment`, the value of `sales_increase` will also increase proportionally because it is directly multiplied by `investment`.\n\n5.
