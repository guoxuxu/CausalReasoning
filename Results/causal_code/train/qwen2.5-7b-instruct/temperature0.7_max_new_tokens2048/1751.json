  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Since 'watching movies' is only planned for 'rainy' weather as defined in plan_activity(), observing this activity allows one to infer that the cause (weather) was 'rainy'. This aligns with the causal inference from effect to cause without intervention.",

    "To determine if observing the activity as 'watching movies' can inform us that the weather was 'rainy', let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Generate Weather**: The `generate_weather()` function randomly selects one of three weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. **Plan Activity Based on Weather**:\n   - If the weather is 'sunny', the activity will be 'picnic'.\n   - If the weather is 'rainy', the activity will be 'watching movies'.\n   - If the weather is 'cloudy', the activity will be 'reading'.\n\n3. **Observation**: We observe that the activity is 'watching movies'.\n\n4. **Causal Relationship**: The relationship between 'weather' and 'activity' is deterministic for 'rainy' weather. When it rains, the planned activity is 'watching movies'. However, 'watching movies' can also be chosen when the weather is not rainy (e.g., 'cloudy' weather).\n\nGiven this information, while 'watching movies' strongly suggests that the weather might have been 'rainy', it does not definitively confirm it because 'watching movies' could also be planned for other reasons like 'cloudy' weather.\n\nTherefore, based on the given causal relationships, observing the activity as 'watching movies' does not provide enough certainty to conclude that the weather was definitely 'rainy'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
