    "Let's break down the steps to reason through this:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `HealthSystem` is initialized with an initial health of 100.\n   - The `has_immunity` flag is set to `False`.\n\n2. **Applying Medication**:\n   - `apply_medication(60)` is called.\n   - Since the dose (60) is greater than 50, the following happens:\n     - `health` increases by 20 (from 100 to 120).\n     - `has_immunity` is set to `True`.\n\n3. **Encountering Pathogen**:\n   - `encounter_pathogen()` is called.\n   - Since `has_immunity` is `True`, no action is taken (no decrease in health).\n\n4. **Final Health Check**:\n   - After applying the medication and encountering the pathogen, the health remains at 120.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"If a higher dose of medication is applied, will the system maintain or increase health even after encountering a pathogen?\"\n\n- A higher dose means more than 50 units.\n- This results in a health increase of 20 units.\n- If a pathogen is encountered while immunity is present (`has_immunity=True`), there is no reduction in health.\n\nTherefore, the system will maintain or increase its health even after encountering a pathogen if a higher dose of medication is applied.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
