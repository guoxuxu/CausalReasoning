    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficSystem` class has two properties:\n   - `trafficLight`: which can be 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'\n   - `carsMoving`: which is a boolean indicating whether cars are allowed to move\n\n2. The `changeLight` method changes the traffic light color and updates the `carsMoving` status:\n   - If the new color is 'red', `carsMoving` is set to false.\n   - For any other color, `carsMoving` is set to true.\n\n3. The `simulateAccident` method explicitly sets `carsMoving` to false, regardless of the current traffic light color.\n\n4. In the provided code:\n   - `cityTraffic.changeLight('yellow')` changes the light to yellow, but does not affect `carsMoving` since yellow does not turn it off.\n   - `cityTraffic.simulateAccident()` then explicitly sets `carsMoving` to false.\n\n5. When `getStatus` is called, it returns the current state of `trafficLight` and `carsMoving`.\n\n6. Since `simulateAccident` was called after changing the light to yellow, `carsMoving` is false, even though the light is yellow, not red.\n\nTherefore, if the cars are not moving (`carsMoving` is false), it is not necessarily because the traffic light is red.
