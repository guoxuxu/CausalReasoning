    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `apply_discount` method checks if `self.total > 100`.\n2. If the condition is true, it applies a discount of `discount` to `self.total` using the formula `self.total *= (1 - discount)`.\n3. A 10% discount means `discount` would be 0.10.\n4. Therefore, the formula becomes `self.total *= (1 - 0.10)` which simplifies to `self.total *= 0.90`.\n5. This multiplication operation will only occur if the initial `self.total` is indeed greater than 100.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the statement is correct. The total will decrease only if the initial total was greater than 100 when a 10% discount is applied.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `apply_discount` method to answer this question:\n\n1. The method `apply_discount(discount)` checks if `self.total > 100`.\n2. If the condition is true, it applies the discount by multiplying `self.total` with `(1 - discount)`.\n3. If the condition is false, no discount is applied.\n\nGiven that the discount is 10%, we can substitute `discount` with 0.10 in our analysis.\n\nThe key point here is the conditional check `if self.total > 100`. This means the discount will only be applied if the total amount before applying the discount is greater than 100.\n\nTherefore, the total will decrease only if the initial total was greater than 100 after considering the 10% discount.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `apply_discount` method checks if `self.total > 100`.\n2. If this condition is true, it applies a discount of `discount` to the total.\n3. The discount is calculated as `self.total * (1 - discount)`, where `discount` is 0.10 for a 10% discount.\n\nNow, let's consider the question:\n- We need to determine if the total decreases only when the initial total is greater than 100.\n\nBased on the code:\n- If the total is not greater than 100, the method does nothing and returns without modifying the total.\n- If the total is greater than 100, the method applies a 10% discount to the total.\n\nTherefore, the total will only decrease if the initial total was greater than 100.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

If the condition is true (i.e., the total is indeed greater than 100), it applies the discount.\n3. The discount is applied by multiplying the total by `(1 - discount)`, where `discount` is 10% or 0.10.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario:\n- If the initial total is exactly 100, applying the 10% discount would not change the total because `100 * (1 - 0.10) = 90`, which is less than 100, but the condition `self.total > 100` fails, so no discount is applied.\n- If the initial total is less than 100, the condition `self.total > 100` fails, so no discount is applied.\n- If the initial total is greater than 100, the discount is applied as expected.\n\nTherefore, the total will only decrease if the initial total was greater than 100, considering all possible values.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
