    "Let's analyze the given function step by step to determine if the final price generally increases when the supply decreases.\n\n1. **Base Price**: The base price is fixed at 100.\n\n2. **Price Increase Based on Supply**:\n   - If `supply < 50`, the price increases by 20.\n   - If `supply >= 100`, the price decreases by 10.\n   - Otherwise (i.e., `50 <= supply < 100`), the price increases by 5.\n\n3. **Demand Factor**:\n   - If `demand > 100`, the demand factor adds 15 to the price.\n   - Otherwise, it subtracts 5 from the price.\n\n4. **Promo Discount**:\n   - If `is_promo_active` is True, there is a discount of 20.\n   - Otherwise, there is no discount.\n\nNow, let's consider how the final price changes with decreasing supply:\n\n- **Decrease from >= 100 to < 100**:\n  - If supply was 100 or more, the price decrease was -10.\n  - If supply decreases to between 50 and 99, the price increase becomes 5.\n  - Net change: -10 (initial) + 5 (new) = -5. So, the price increases slightly.\n\n- **Decrease from 50 to < 50**:\n  - If supply was between 50 and 99, the price increase was 5.\n  - If supply decreases below 50, the price increase becomes 20.\n  - Net change: 5 (initial) + 20 (new) = 25. So, the price increases significantly.\n\n- **Decrease from < 50 to < 50 (remains < 50)**:\n  - If supply was already less than 50, the price increase remains 20.\n  - No change in price due to supply.\n\nIn all cases where supply decreases, the price either increases slightly or significantly, depending on the initial supply level. Therefore, the final price generally increases when the supply decreases.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze the given function step by step to determine if the final price will generally increase when the supply decreases.\n\n1. **Base Price**: The base price is fixed at 100 regardless of supply, demand, or promotional status.\n\n2. **Price Increase Based on Supply**:\n   - If `supply < 50`, the price increases by 20.\n   - If `supply >= 100`, the price decreases by 10.\n   - Otherwise (50 ≤ supply < 100), the price increases by 5.\n\n3. **Demand Factor**:\n   - If `demand > 100`, the demand factor adds 15 to the price.\n   - Otherwise, it subtracts 5 from the price.\n\n4. **Promotional Discount**:\n   - If `is_promo_active` is True, a discount of 20 is applied.\n   - Otherwise, no discount is applied.\n\nNow, let's consider how a decrease in supply affects the price:\n\n- **Case 1: Supply was already less than 50**  \n  - Current: Price increases by 20.\n  - Decrease: No change since the condition is still met (price increase remains 20).\n\n- **Case 2: Supply was between 50 and 99**  \n  - Current: Price increases by 5.\n  - Decrease: The price increase could drop to 0 if supply drops below 50, leading to no net change or even a decrease if demand or promotions affect the price negatively.\n\n- **Case 3: Supply was 100 or more**  \n  - Current: Price decreases by 10.\n  - Decrease: The price would start decreasing further, potentially more significantly if demand or promotions also affect the price.\n\nIn summary, a decrease in supply can lead to either no change (if the supply was already low) or a potential increase (if the supply was high enough to cause a significant decrease). However, considering all possible scenarios, the overall effect is not guaranteed to be an increase in price; it depends heavily on other factors like demand and whether there is a promotion active.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is that the final price will not generally increase when the supply decreases.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Base Price**: The base price is fixed at 100.\n\n2. **Supply Effect**:\n   - If `supply < 50`, the price increases by 20.\n   - If `supply >= 100`, the price decreases by 10.\n   - Otherwise (50 ≤ supply < 100), the price increases by 5.\n   \n   So, when supply decreases, we need to consider the following:\n   - If the initial supply was greater than or equal to 100, decreasing it might bring it into the range where the price increases by 5 instead of decreasing by 10.\n   - If the initial supply was between 50 and 100, decreasing it could push it below 50, causing the price to increase by 20 instead of staying at a 5 increase or decrease.\n\n3. **Demand Factor**: This can either increase the price by 15 (if demand > 100) or decrease it by 5 (if demand ≤ 100). The effect of demand on the price is independent of the supply change.\n\n4. **Promo Discount**: This can either reduce the price by 20 (if is_promo_active) or not affect it (if not).\n\nNow, let's analyze the general trend:\n- If the supply was initially high (≥ 100), decreasing it would likely move it into the range where the price increases by 5 instead of decreasing by 10, which is a net positive change.\n- If the supply was initially in the middle range (50 ≤ supply < 100), decreasing it could push it below 50, causing a larger increase in price.\n- The demand and promo factors do not directly correlate with the supply decrease in a way that would universally increase the price.\n\nGiven these points, while there are scenarios where the price might increase due to a supply decrease, there are also scenarios where it might decrease. Therefore, we cannot say that the final price will generally increase as a result of a supply decrease.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Base Price**: The base price is always 100.\n\n2. **Price Increase Based on Supply**:\n   - If supply < 50, price_increase = 20 (increase)\n   - If supply ≥ 100, price_increase = -10 (decrease)\n   - Otherwise, price_increase = 5 (increase)\n\n3. **Demand Factor**:\n   - If demand > 100, demand_factor = 15 (increase)\n   - Otherwise, demand_factor = -5 (decrease)\n\n4. **Promo Discount**:\n   - If is_promo_active, promo_discount = 20 (decrease)\n   - Otherwise, promo_discount = 0 (no change)\n\n5. **Final Price Calculation**:\n   - Final_price = base_price + price_increase + demand_factor - promo_discount\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when supply decreases:\n\n- When supply is between 50 and 99, price_increase is 5.\n- When supply is less than 50, price_increase is 20.\n- When supply is greater than or equal to 100, price_increase is -10, which would decrease the price.\n\nWhen supply decreases:\n- It moves from a higher supply range to a lower one.\n- Generally, as supply decreases, it will move towards the range where price_increase is positive (5 or 20).\n- This means the price_increase term will tend to be more positive or at least not negative.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the overall effect:\n- The demand factor and promo discount can both have significant impacts.\n- If demand is high and promo is active, the demand_factor and promo_discount could outweigh the price_increase.\n\nBut focusing specifically on the supply decrease:\n- Without considering other factors, decreasing supply generally aligns with a positive price_increase (5 or 20), which tends to increase the final price.\n\nGiven this reasoning, even though there are other variables that could affect the final outcome, the general trend is that decreasing supply will generally lead to an increase in the final price.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
