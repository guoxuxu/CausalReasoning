    "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine if the 'discounted_price' for existing members would be affected by an additional 10% increase in their discount rate.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Current Logic\nThe `compute_discounted_price` function calculates the final price after applying a discount based on membership status. Here's how it works:\n- If the customer is a member (`is_member` is `True`), the discount is increased by 5%.\n- The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Current Scenario\nGiven:\n- `price = 100`\n- `is_member = True`\n- `received_discount = 0.10`\n\nSince `is_member` is `True`, the function will add an additional 5% to the `received_discount`:\n- New discount = `received_discount + 0.05 = 0.10 + 0.05 = 0.15`\n- Final price = `100 * (1 - 0.15) = 100 * 0.85 = 85`\n\n### Step 3: Consider the Proposed Change\nThe proposed change introduces an additional 10% increase in the discount rate for members. This means that if a member is already getting a 15% discount, they would now get an additional 10% off of that 15%.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the New Discount Rate\nWith the new policy, the effective discount rate for members would be:\n- New discount = `0.15 + 0.10 * 0.15 = 0.15 + 0.015 = 0.165` (or 16.5%)\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the New Discounted Price\nUsing the new discount rate:\n- Final price = `100 * (1 - 0.165) = 100 * 0.835 = 83.5`\n\n### Step 6: Compare the Results\n- Original discounted price with current logic: `85`\n- New discounted price with the proposed change: `83.5`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe new policy would indeed affect the 'discounted_price' for existing members, reducing it from 85 to 83.5.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
