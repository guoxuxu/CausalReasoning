    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with `mySchool` initialized as a new instance of `School` with 400 students and 20 teachers.\n\n2. The `calculatePerformance` method returns the ratio of students to teachers:\n   - Initial performance: 400 / 20 = 20\n\n3. The `increaseTeachers` method increases the number of teachers by 5:\n   - New number of teachers: 20 + 5 = 25\n\n4. After calling `increaseTeachers`, the performance is recalculated:\n   - New performance: 400 / 25 = 16\n\n5. We can see that the performance has declined from 20 to 16.\n\n6. The question asks if this decline was necessarily due to a decrease in student numbers.\n\n7. In our scenario, the student count remained constant at 400.\n\n8.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have a `School` class with properties for students, teachers, and calculated performance.\n2. The performance is calculated as the number of students divided by the number of teachers.\n3. There's a method `increaseTeachers` that increases the number of teachers and recalculates performance.\n4. Initially, we create `mySchool` with 400 students and 20 teachers.\n5. We then call `increaseTeachers(5)`, which increases the number of teachers to 25.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens to performance:\n- Initial performance: \\( \\frac{400}{20} = 20 \\)\n- After increasing teachers: \\( \\frac{400}{25} = 16 \\)\n\nThe performance has indeed declined from 20 to 16.\n\nThe question asks if a decline in performance was necessarily due to a decrease in student numbers. In this case:\n- Student numbers remained constant at 400.\n- Performance declined because the number of teachers increased, not because student numbers decreased.\n\nTherefore, the decline in performance was not due to a decrease in student numbers.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

Then, we call `increaseTeachers(5)` which adds 5 more teachers to the school.\n\n4. Now, the number of teachers becomes 20 + 5 = 25.\n\n5. The performance is recalculated:\n   - New Performance = Number of students / New number of teachers\n   - New Performance = 400 / 25 = 16\n\n6.
