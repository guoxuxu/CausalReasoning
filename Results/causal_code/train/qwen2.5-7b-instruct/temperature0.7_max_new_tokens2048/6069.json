    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with an empty `ShoppingBasket` object.\n2. We add two items: 'apple' priced at $1 and 'banana' priced at $2.\n3. The total cost is now $3 ($1 + $2).\n4. A discount of 10% is applied, reducing the total cost to $2.70 (3 * 0.90).\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where we have a `remove_item` method:\n\n5. If we call `remove_item` for one of these items, say 'apple', the following happens:\n   - 'apple' is removed from the list of items.\n   - The cost of 'apple', which is $1, is subtracted from the total cost.\n\n6. After removing 'apple', the basket contains only 'banana' priced at $2.\n7. The new total cost would be $2.\n\nTherefore, if we call the `remove_item` method after adding items, it indeed decreases the `total_cost`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We have an instance of `ShoppingBasket` named `basket`.\n   - We add two items ('apple' and 'banana') with respective prices of 1 and 2.\n   - The total cost is updated accordingly.\n\n2. **Adding Items**:\n   ```python\n   basket.add_item('apple', 1)\n   basket.add_item('banana', 2)\n   ```\n   - After adding 'apple' and 'banana', the `items` list will be `['apple', 'banana']`.\n   - The `total_cost` will be `1 + 2 = 3`.\n\n3. **Applying Discount**:\n   ```python\n   basket.apply_discount(10)\n   ```\n   - The `total_cost` is reduced by 10%: `3 * (1 - 10/100) = 3 * 0.9 = 2.7`.\n\n4. **Introducing 'remove_item' Method**:\n   - Let's assume we now have a `remove_item` method that can remove an item and its cost from the basket.\n   - If we call `remove_item('apple')`, the following changes occur:\n     - The item 'apple' is removed from the `items` list.\n     - The `total_cost` is decreased by the cost of 'apple', which is 1.\n\n5. **Effect on Total Cost**:\n   - After removing 'apple', the `items` list becomes `['banana']`.\n   - The `total_cost` becomes `2.7 - 1 = 1.7`.\n\nBased on the above steps, it is clear that calling the `remove_item` method after adding items will indeed decrease the `total_cost`. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Suppose we remove one of the items (either 'apple' or 'banana'). Removing 'apple' would reduce the total cost by $1, making it $2.70 - $1 = $1.70. Removing 'banana' would reduce the total cost by $2, making it $2.70 - $2 = $0.70.\n\nIn both cases, the total cost decreases after removing an item.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"calling this new 'remove_item' method after adding items will decrease the 'total_cost'\" is true.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Initially, we have an empty shopping basket with `total_cost` set to 0.\n\n2. We add two items:\n   - An apple for $1\n   - A banana for $2\n\n3.
