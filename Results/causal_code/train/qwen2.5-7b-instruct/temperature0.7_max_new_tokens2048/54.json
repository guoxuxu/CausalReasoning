    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `willPeopleGoOutside` method returns `true` if both conditions are met:\n   - It is sunny (`isSunny == true`)\n   - The temperature is greater than 25 (`temperature > 25`)\n\n2. If people are not going outside, the condition for going outside must be false.\n\n3. For the condition to be false, either:\n   - It is not sunny (`isSunny == false`), or\n   - The temperature is not greater than 25 (`temperature <= 25`)\n\n4. However, just because the condition for people going outside is false does not necessarily mean it is not sunny. People might stay inside even if it is sunny but the temperature is not above 25 degrees.\n\nTherefore, a forecast of people not going outside does not necessarily imply that it isn't sunny; it could also be due to the temperature being too low.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

The temperature could also be below or equal to 25, which would also result in `willPeopleGoOutside()` returning `false`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is \"No\" because the forecast of people not going outside does not imply that it isn't sunny with certainty.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
