    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `setWaterSupply` method takes a boolean parameter `status`.\n2.

If `status` is false, it sets `waterSupply` to false and calls `alertSystem('Water supply cut off.')`.\n4. The question asks if 'Water supply cut off.' was shown.\n5. 'Water supply cut off.' is shown when the second argument to `setWaterSupply` is false.\n6.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to determine if setWaterSupply(false) was called based on the alert message.\n\n2.

We are observing an alert message \"Water supply cut off.\" being shown.\n\n5. This exact message is only generated when setWaterSupply(false) is called.\n\n6.
