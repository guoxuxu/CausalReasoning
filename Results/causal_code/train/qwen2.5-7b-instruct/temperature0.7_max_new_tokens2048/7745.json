  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Since the grade average calculation and conditional checks are performed within a loop for each student without external interference, any input of grades all above 90 inherently results in an average also above 90, satisfying the condition for receiving a grade of 'A'. No external intervention alters this causal mechanism from input grades to the output grade in the summary.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_scores` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. For each student in the `data` dictionary:\n   - It calculates the average grade by summing up all grades and dividing by the number of grades.\n   - It then checks the value of this average grade against different thresholds to assign a letter grade.\n\n3. Specifically, for the condition where all grades are above 90:\n   - If any single grade is 90 or above, the average will also be 90 or above.\n   - The code states that if the average grade is 90 or above, it assigns 'A' to that student.\n\n4. Therefore, if a student's grades array contains all scores above 90:\n   - The average grade will definitely be above 90.\n   - According to the code logic, this will result in the student being assigned an 'A'.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_scores` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2.

The grading criteria are:\n   - If the average grade is >= 90, the student gets an 'A'.\n   - If the average grade is < 90 but >= 80, the student gets a 'B'.\n   - If the average grade is < 80 but >= 70, the student gets a 'C'.\n   - Otherwise, the student gets an 'F'.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the scenario where a student's grades array contains all scores above 90.\n\n5. If all grades are above 90, then the average grade will also be above 90 (since we're averaging numbers greater than 90).\n\n6. According to the grading criteria provided, any average grade that is >= 90 should result in an 'A'.\n\nTherefore, if a student's grades array contains all scores above 90, the result for that student in the summary dictionary would indeed always be 'A'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

It then checks the average grade against different thresholds to assign a letter grade:\n   - If the average grade is >= 90, it assigns 'A'.\n   - If not, it checks for other conditions (80-89, 70-79, below 70).\n\nNow, considering the specific case where a student's grades array contains all scores above 90:\n\n6. If every grade in the list is above 90, the sum of these grades will be significantly higher than the product of the number of grades and 90.\n7. Therefore, the average grade will also be above 90.\n\nGiven this logic, if a student's grades array contains all scores above 90, the average grade will indeed be >= 90.\n\nThus, the result for that student in the `summary` dictionary would always be 'A'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
