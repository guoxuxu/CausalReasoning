    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `business_growth` takes two parameters: `temp` (temperature) and `economic_indicator`.\n2. It first checks the value of `economic_indicator`:\n   - If `economic_indicator` is greater than 75, it sets `market_stability` to `True`.\n   - Otherwise, it sets `market_stability` to `False`.\n3. Then, it checks the value of `temp` and `market_stability`:\n   - If `temp` is greater than 20 AND `market_stability` is `True`, it returns 'High Growth'.\n   - If `temp` is greater than 20 AND `market_stability` is `False`, it returns 'Moderate Growth'.\n   - Otherwise, it returns 'Low Growth'.\n\nNow, let's apply the given condition:\n- The economic indicator is set to 90.\n- Since 90 is greater than 75, `market_stability` will be set to `True`.\n\nWe need to determine if the business will observe 'High Growth' under these conditions.\n\n- The condition for 'High Growth' is `temp > 20 AND market_stability == True`.\n- We know `market_stability` is `True`, so we need to check if `temp > 20`.\n\nThe problem does not specify a particular value for `temp`. However, since the question asks if the business will observe 'High Growth', we can assume that the temperature is indeed greater than 20 (as it is a necessary condition for 'High Growth').\n\nGiven these conditions, the function will return 'High Growth'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `business_growth` function step by step:\n\n1. **Economic Indicator Check**:\n   - The function first checks if the `economic_indicator` is greater than 75.\n   - If it is, `market_stability` is set to `True`.\n   - If it is not, `market_stability` is set to `False`.\n\n2. **Given Input**:\n   - We are told that the economic indicator is set to 90.\n\n3. **Market Stability Determination**:\n   - Since 90 is greater than 75, `market_stability` will be `True`.\n\n4. **Temperature Check**:\n   - The function then checks if the `temp` is greater than 20.\n   - If it is, and `market_stability` is `True`, the function returns `'High Growth'`.\n   - If `temp` is greater than 20 but `market_stability` is `False`, it returns `'Moderate Growth'`.\n   - If `temp` is not greater than 20, regardless of `market_stability`, it returns `'Low Growth'`.\n\n5. **Assumption for Temperature**:\n   - The problem does not specify a particular value for `temp`. However, we need to determine if `High Growth` can be observed under the given condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - For `High Growth` to be returned, both conditions must be met:\n     - `temp` must be greater than 20.\n     - `market_stability` must be `True` (which is already true with an economic indicator of 90).\n\nSince the problem does not provide a specific `temp` value, we assume any `temp` greater than 20 would satisfy the condition for `High Growth`.\n\nTherefore, if an intervention sets the economic indicator to 90, the business will indeed observe High Growth as long as the temperature is above 20.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
