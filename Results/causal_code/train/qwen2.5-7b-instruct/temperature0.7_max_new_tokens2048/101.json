  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "According to the code, increasing the temperature leads to a change in the weather status directly based on the update_weather method's check (>30 is 'Sunny'). There are no other dependencies in the method that can alter this outcome, thus increasing the temperature to 35 will change the weather status to 'Sunny'.",
  "causal_map": "temperature → weather_status",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in temperature will cause the weather status to become Sunny if it exceeds 30 degrees.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial temperature for Toronto is set to 25 degrees in the `City` class.\n2. The `WeatherSystem` class has a method `update_weather()` that sets the `weather_status` based on the temperature:\n   - If temperature > 30, weather_status is 'Sunny'\n   - If 20 <= temperature <= 30, weather_status is 'Cloudy'\n   - Otherwise, weather_status is 'Rainy'\n3. Initially, with a temperature of 25, the weather status would be 'Cloudy'.\n4. The question asks what happens if the temperature is increased to 35.\n5. With a temperature of 35, which is greater than 30, the condition `if self.temperature > 30:` will be true.\n6. Therefore, the `weather_status` will be set to 'Sunny'.\n\nSo, if the temperature is increased from 25 to 35 in Toronto, the weather status will indeed become 'Sunny' without any other intervention.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial temperature for Toronto is set to 25 in the `City` object.\n2. When `daily_forecast()` is called, it updates the weather status based on the current temperature of 25.\n   - Since 25 falls within the range of 20 <= self.temperature <= 30, the weather status is set to 'Cloudy'.\n3. If the temperature is then increased to 35, we need to check how this affects the weather status.\n4. In the `WeatherSystem` class, the `update_weather()` method checks the following conditions:\n   - If self.temperature > 30, then self.weather_status = 'Sunny'\n   - For any other condition (including when self.temperature <= 30), the weather status is not set to 'Sunny'.\n5. With the new temperature of 35, which is greater than 30, the condition `if self.temperature > 30` will be true.\n6. Therefore, the weather status will indeed be updated to 'Sunny'.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial temperature for Toronto is set to 25 degrees.\n2. When `daily_forecast()` is called for Toronto, the `update_weather()` method of the `WeatherSystem` class is invoked.\n3. In the `update_weather()` method, there is a conditional check based on the temperature:\n   - If `self.temperature > 30`, then `self.weather_status` is set to 'Sunny'.\n   - For temperatures between 20 and 30 (inclusive), `self.weather_status` is set to 'Cloudy'.\n   - For temperatures below 20, `self.weather_status` is set to 'Rainy'.\n4. With an initial temperature of 25, the current weather status would be 'Cloudy' after the first call to `daily_forecast()`.\n5. If the temperature is increased to 35, we need to check how this affects the weather status:\n   - Since 35 is greater than 30, the condition `self.temperature > 30` will be true.\n   - Therefore, `self.weather_status` will be set to 'Sunny'.\n\nGiven that the logic directly sets the weather status based on the temperature and the increase from 25 to 35 clearly meets the condition for 'Sunny', the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Initially, for Toronto with a temperature of 25, the `daily_forecast()` method updates the `weather_status` to 'Cloudy'.\n5. If the temperature is increased to 35, the `weather_system` object within the `City` instance will have its `temperature` attribute updated to 35.\n6. When `daily_forecast()` is called again, it will call `update_weather()`, which checks the new temperature of 35.\n7. Since 35 > 30, the condition `if self.temperature > 30:` will be true, and `self.weather_status` will be set to 'Sunny'.\n\nTherefore, if the temperature is increased from 25 to 35 in Toronto, the weather status will indeed become 'Sunny' without any other intervention.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
