    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `simulateStorm()` method is defined in the `WeatherSimulator` class.\n2. When `simulateStorm()` is called:\n   - `isRaining` is set to `true`.\n   - The temperature is decreased by 5 degrees.\n\n3. The key point here is whether this method will always lead to a decrease in temperature when invoked.\n\n4. To determine if the temperature will definitely decrease, we need to consider the following:\n   - The method directly decreases the temperature by 5 degrees.\n   - There are no conditions that prevent this decrease from happening.\n\n5. The only way the temperature would not decrease is if the current temperature is already below the starting point minus 5 degrees, but there is no logic in the method that checks the current temperature before decreasing it.\n\n6.

However, the question specifically asks if invoking `simulateStorm()` will definitively lead to a decrease in temperature.\n\nGiven the code:\n- If `simulateStorm()` is called, the temperature will definitely be decreased by 5.\n- If `simulateStorm()` is not called, the temperature will remain unchanged.\n\nSince the method guarantees a decrease in temperature when invoked, the answer to the question is \"definitive.\"\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
