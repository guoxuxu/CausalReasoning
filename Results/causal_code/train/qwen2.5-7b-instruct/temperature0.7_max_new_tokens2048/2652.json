    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_score` takes two parameters: `temperature` and `humidity`.\n\n2. The formula for calculating the discomfort index is:\n   discomfort_index = (0.81 * temperature) + 0.01 * humidity * (0.99 * temperature - 14.3) + 46.3\n\n3. We need to analyze how changing the temperature affects the discomfort index when humidity is fixed at 50.\n\n4. Let's break down the formula with humidity set to 50:\n   - 0.01 * 50 * (0.99 * temperature - 14.3) becomes a constant term since humidity is fixed.\n   - This simplifies to: 0.5 * (0.99 * temperature - 14.3) = 0.495 * temperature - 7.15\n\n5. So the simplified formula becomes:\n   discomfort_index = (0.81 * temperature) + (0.495 * temperature - 7.15) + 46.3\n                    = 1.305 * temperature + 39.15\n\n6.

Since the simplified formula shows a direct relationship between temperature and discomfort index, any change in temperature will result in a corresponding change in the discomfort index.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}, because changes to the temperature will indeed affect the discomfort index even when humidity is fixed at 50.",
