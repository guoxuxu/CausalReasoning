    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` processes each item in the input list.\n2. For each item, it checks two conditions:\n   - If the temperature is greater than 25, it sets the 'status' to 'high'.\n   - If the humidity is greater than 50, it sets the 'risk' to 'high'.\n3. The question specifically asks about the condition where the status is 'high'.\n4. From the logic inside the function, we can see that the 'status' is set to 'high' only when the temperature is greater than 25.\n5. There is no other path in the code where 'status' is set to 'high' without the temperature being greater than 25.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that if the status of an item is 'high', then the temperature must have been greater than 25.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
