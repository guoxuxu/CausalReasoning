    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `isCloudy` and `isRainy` are determined randomly in the constructor.\n   - If `isCloudy` is true, then `isRainy` might be true depending on an additional condition.\n\n2. **clearSkies Method**:\n   - This method sets both `isCloudy` to false and `isRainy` to false.\n   - It does not depend on the original state of `isCloudy` and `isRainy`.\n\n3. **Observation**:\n   - After calling `clearSkies()`, it is observed that there was no rain (`isRainy` is false).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The fact that there was no rain after `clearSkies()` being called does not provide any information about the original state of `isCloudy`.\n   - `clearSkies()` explicitly sets `isCloudy` to false and `isRainy` to false, regardless of their initial values.\n   - Therefore, even if `isRainy` was initially true, it could have been made false by `clearSkies()`, and `isCloudy` could still have been true initially but was set to false by `clearSkies()`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot conclude that there were no clouds originally just because there was no rain after `clearSkies()` was called.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
