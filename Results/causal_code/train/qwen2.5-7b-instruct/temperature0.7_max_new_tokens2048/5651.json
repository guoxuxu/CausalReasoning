  "Explanation": "The 'startRain()' method, which checks temperature >5 degrees and sets 'isRaining' to true, needs to be explicitly called to change the rain status. Merely changing the temperature through 'changeWeather()' does not automatically invoke 'startRain()'.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Temperature**: The initial temperature is 8 degrees.\n2. **Temperature Change**: The `changeWeather` method is called with a parameter of `10`, meaning the temperature will increase by 10 degrees.\n3. **New Temperature Calculation**:\n   - Initial temperature: 8 degrees\n   - Temperature change: +10 degrees\n   - New temperature: 8 + 10 = 18 degrees\n\n4. **Condition for Rain**:\n   - The `startRain` method checks if the temperature is greater than 5 degrees to determine if it starts raining.\n   - With the new temperature being 18 degrees, this condition (`temperature > 5`) is satisfied.\n\n5. **Effect on `isRaining`**:\n   - Since the condition is met, the `isRaining` variable is set to `true`.\n\n6. **Further Action Required**:\n   - The problem statement mentions that there is no further action required after the temperature increase.\n   - The `startRain` method is not explicitly called in the scenario described, but the condition is met based on the new temperature.\n\nGiven these steps, even though `startRain` is not explicitly called, the condition for starting rain is met due to the new temperature.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

We need to check if the condition for starting rain is met:\n   - The `startRain` method checks if the temperature is greater than 5.\n   - Since the new temperature is 18, which is greater than 5, the condition is satisfied.\n5. According to the `startRain` method, when the temperature is greater than 5, `isRaining` is set to true.\n\nTherefore, after the temperature increases by 10 degrees from an initial value of 8, it will indeed start raining.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Since the new temperature is 18 degrees, which is indeed greater than 5 degrees, the `startRain` method would set `isRaining` to true.\n\nHowever, the question asks if it rains \"without any further action in the code\". The `startRain` method is not automatically called when the temperature changes. It would only be called explicitly by calling the `startRain()` method.\n\nGiven that no explicit call to `startRain()` is made after changing the weather, the system does not automatically start raining just because the temperature increased to 18 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
