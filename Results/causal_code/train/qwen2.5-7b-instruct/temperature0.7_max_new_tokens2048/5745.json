    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - The function `calculate_health_score` takes four parameters: `age`, `weight`, `heart_rate`, and `steps_per_day`.\n   - If `heart_rate` is not tracked (disabled), it means that the values of `heart_penalty` and `heart_bonus` will always be zero.\n\n2. **Base Score Calculation**:\n   - If `age > 50`, the base score is set to 70.\n   - Otherwise, the base score is set to 80.\n\n3. **Weight Penalty Calculation**:\n   - If `weight > 100`, there is a weight penalty of 10 points.\n   - Otherwise, there is no weight penalty.\n\n4. **Heart Rate Impact**:\n   - Since heart rate tracking is disabled, both `heart_penalty` and `heart_bonus` will always be 0.\n\n5. **Activity Bonus Calculation**:\n   - If `steps_per_day > 10000`, there is an activity bonus of 20 points.\n   - Otherwise, there is no activity bonus.\n\n6. **Health Score Calculation**:\n   - The health score is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{health\\_score} = \\text{base\\_score} - \\text{weight\\_penalty} + \\text{heart\\_bonus} - \\text{heart\\_penalty} + \\text{activity\\_bonus}\n     \\]\n   - Given that `heart_penalty` and `heart_bonus` are always 0 when heart rate tracking is disabled, the formula simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{health\\_score} = \\text{base\\_score} - \\text{weight\\_penalty} + \\text{activity\\_bonus}\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of increasing `steps_per_day` above 10000:\n\n- If `steps_per_day > 10000`, the `activity_bonus` is 20 points.\n- If `steps_per_day ≤ 10000`, the `activity_bonus` is 0 points.\n\nSince the only variable that changes with `steps_per_day` is the `activity_bonus`, and this directly adds points to the health score, increasing `steps_per_day` above 10000 will indeed increase the health score.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function:**\n   - The function calculates a `health_score` based on several factors: `age`, `weight`, `heart_rate`, and `steps_per_day`.\n   - If `heart_rate` is less than 60, it adds a bonus of 15.\n   - If `heart_rate` is greater than 100, it adds a penalty of 20.\n   - If `heart_rate` is between 60 and 100, there is no penalty or bonus for `heart_rate`.\n\n2. **Intervention Scenario:**\n   - We are considering the scenario where `heart_rate` tracking is disabled.
