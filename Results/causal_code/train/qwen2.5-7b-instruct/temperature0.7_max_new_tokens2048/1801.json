    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TemperatureController` class has an attribute `threshold` which determines when to turn on heating.\n2. The `update_temperature` method takes an `external_temp` parameter and compares it to the `threshold`.\n3. If `external_temp` is less than `threshold`, the following actions occur:\n   - `is_heating_on` is set to True.\n   - The temperature is increased by 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that if the `external_temp` parameter is less than the `threshold`, the temperature will indeed increase by 2 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a `TemperatureController` class with methods to control the temperature based on an external temperature.\n\n2. The `update_temperature` method is responsible for adjusting the internal temperature based on the external temperature (`external_temp`) and the pre-defined `threshold`.\n\n3. The logic within the `update_temperature` method is as follows:\n   - If `external_temp` is less than `self.threshold`, then:\n     - `self.is_heating_on` is set to `True`\n     - The internal temperature (`self.temperature`) is increased by 2 degrees Celsius\n\n4. If `external_temp` is not less than `self.threshold`, then:\n   - `self.is_heating_on` is set to `False`\n   - The internal temperature is decreased by 1 degree Celsius\n\n5. The question specifically asks what happens when `external_temp` is less than `self.threshold`.\n\n6. Based on the logic in point 3, when `external_temp` is less than `self.threshold`, the internal temperature will indeed increase by 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TemperatureController` class has an `update_temperature` method that takes an `external_temp` parameter.\n\n2. Inside the `update_temperature` method, there's an if-else condition checking if `external_temp` is less than the `threshold`.\n\n3. If `external_temp < self.threshold` is true:\n   - `is_heating_on` is set to True.\n   - The temperature is increased by 2 degrees Celsius.\n\n4. If `external_temp >= self.threshold`:\n   - `is_heating_on` is set to False.\n   - The temperature is decreased by 1 degree Celsius.\n\n5.

    "Let's break down the logic of the `TemperatureController` class to determine if the temperature will increase when the external temperature (`external_temp`) is less than the threshold.\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `TemperatureController` is initialized with a `threshold` value and a default temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.\n2. **update_temperature Method**:\n   - This method checks if `external_temp` is less than the `threshold`.\n   - If `external_temp` is less than the `threshold`, it sets `is_heating_on` to `True` and increases the current temperature by 2 degrees.\n   - If `external_temp` is not less than the `threshold`, it sets `is_heating_on` to `False` and decreases the current temperature by 1 degree.\n\nGiven this information, we can see that the condition for increasing the temperature is when `external_temp` is less than the `threshold`. When this condition is met, the temperature is increased by 2 degrees.\n\nTherefore, if the `external_temp` parameter is less than the threshold, the temperature will indeed increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
