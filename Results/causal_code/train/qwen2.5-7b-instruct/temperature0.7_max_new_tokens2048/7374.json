  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The `send_alert` function sends an alert if the status is either 'drought' or 'flood'. Therefore, if an alert was sent, it implies that the only statuses that could trigger this are 'drought' or 'flood'.",
  "causal_map": "temperature > 30; rainfall < 10 → status = 'drought'; temperature < 0; rainfall > 50 → status = 'flood'; status = 'drought' → alert_sent = True; status = 'flood' → alert_sent = True",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature is greater than 30 and rainfall is less than 10, then the status is drought, which leads to an alert being sent. If the temperature is less than 0 and rainfall is greater than 50, then the status is flood, which also leads to an alert being sent.",

If the status is 'normal', no alert is sent (False).\n\nNow, considering the question: \"If an alert was sent, can we deduce that there was either a drought or a flood?\"\n\n- An alert is sent only when the status is 'drought' or 'flood'.\n- Therefore, if an alert is sent, it must be because the status was either 'drought' or 'flood'.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
