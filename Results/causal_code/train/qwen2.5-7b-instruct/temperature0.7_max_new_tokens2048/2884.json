    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `compute_bonus` function calculates the bonus based on the difference between `sales` and `quota`.\n2. If `sales > quota`, the bonus is calculated as `0.1 * (sales - quota)`.\n3. If `sales <= quota`, the bonus is `0`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we set the `quota` lower:\n\n4. If the `quota` is lowered while `sales` remains constant, the difference `(sales - quota)` will increase because `sales` is not changing.\n5. Since the bonus is calculated as `0.1 * (difference)`, an increase in the difference will result in a higher bonus.\n\nTherefore, if we set the `quota` lower with the `sales` remaining constant, the bonus will indeed be higher.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `compute_bonus` function calculates the bonus based on the difference between `sales` and `quota`. If `sales` exceed `quota`, it returns 10% of the difference; otherwise, it returns 0.\n\n2. In the `main` function:\n   - `sales` is set to 15000.\n   - `quota` is set to 10000.\n   - The `compute_bonus` function is called with these values.\n   - Since `sales` (15000) is greater than `quota` (10000), the bonus is calculated as 10% of the difference (15000 - 10000).\n\n3. The formula used to calculate the bonus is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bonus} = 0.1 \\times (\\text{Sales} - \\text{Quota})\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, let's consider what happens if we set the `quota` lower while keeping `sales` constant at 15000:\n   - If `quota` is set to 9000, the difference (`sales - quota`) increases to 6000.\n   - The bonus would then be \\(0.1 \\times 6000 = 600\\).\n   - If `quota` is set to 8000, the difference increases to 7000, and the bonus would be \\(0.1 \\times 7000 = 700\\).\n   - As `quota` decreases further, the difference between `sales` and `quota` increases, leading to a higher bonus.\n\nTherefore, systematically setting a lower `quota` while keeping `sales` constant will indeed lead to a higher bonus because the difference between `sales` and `quota` increases, resulting in a larger bonus calculation.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `compute_bonus` function calculates the bonus based on the difference between sales and quota.\n2. If sales are greater than quota, the bonus is calculated as 10% of the difference.\n3. If sales are less than or equal to quota, the bonus is 0.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we change the quota:\n\n4. If sales remain constant, increasing the quota will decrease the difference between sales and quota.\n5. For any given sales amount, there is a specific quota at which the bonus starts being calculated (when sales exceed the quota).\n6. Once sales exceed this specific quota, lowering the quota further would not increase the bonus because the bonus is still calculated as 10% of the difference, but the difference itself decreases.\n7. If the new quota is very low and sales are much higher, the bonus could be larger, but only up to a point where the sales just exceed the new, lower quota.\n8. If the new quota is set so high that it is always exceeded by sales, the bonus calculation remains the same as before the quota was changed.\n\nTherefore, systematically lowering the quota does not necessarily lead to a higher bonus for a constant sales figure. In fact, it might lead to a lower bonus if the new quota is too low compared to the sales.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

If `sales` remains constant, say at 15000, and we change the `quota`:\n   - When `quota` is 10000 (as in the example), since `sales > quota`, the bonus is calculated as `0.1 * (15000 - 10000) = 500`.\n   - If we decrease the `quota` to a value less than 15000, say 9000, the condition `sales > quota` still holds true, so the bonus calculation remains the same: `0.1 * (15000 - 9000) = 600`.\n   - If we further decrease the `quota` to a value even lower, like 8000, the bonus would be `0.1 * (15000 - 8000) = 700`.\n\n4. As we can see, decreasing the `quota` while keeping `sales` constant does indeed lead to a higher bonus because the difference `(sales - quota)` increases.\n\nTherefore, setting the 'quota' lower, with sales remaining constant, will systematically lead to a higher 'bonus'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If sales are less than or equal to quota, the bonus is 0.\n\nNow, let's consider how changing the quota affects the bonus when sales remain constant:\n\n4. If sales are above the quota, lowering the quota will increase the difference between sales and quota, which in turn increases the bonus amount (since it's 10% of that difference).\n5. For example, if sales are 15000 and the original quota is 10000, the bonus is 10% of (15000 - 10000) = 500.\n6. If we lower the quota to, say, 9000, the bonus becomes 10% of (15000 - 9000) = 600.\n7.
