    "Let's break down the function `process_data` to understand how it processes the input data:\n\n1. The function checks if the key `'temperature'` exists in the `data` dictionary.\n2.

It then checks if `temperature` is greater than 30:\n   - If true, it sets `data['status']` to `'too_hot'`.\n   - If false, it sets `data['status']` to `'normal'`.\n\nNext, let's consider the second part of the function:\n\n4. The function checks if the key `'humidity'` exists in the `data` dictionary.\n5. If it does, it retrieves the value of `'humidity'` and assigns it to the variable `humidity`.\n6.

If `temperature` is indeed greater than 30, it sets `data['status']` to 'too_hot'.\n5. If `temperature` is not greater than 30, it sets `data['status']` to 'normal'.\n6. The function also checks for the presence of 'humidity', but this does not affect the setting of 'status'.\n7. The condition for setting 'alert' to 'high_humidity' (humidity > 0.8) is separate from the condition for setting 'status' to 'too_hot'.\n\nGiven these steps, we can see that the only way `data['status']` gets set to 'too_hot' is when the 'temperature' key exists in the input data and its value is greater than 30.\n\nTherefore, if the temperature is set higher than 30, and assuming the 'temperature' key exists in the input data, then `data['status']` will be set to 'too_hot'. However, if the 'temperature' key does not exist in the input data, the status will not be set to 'too_hot' regardless of the temperature value.\n\nSince the problem statement does not specify the existence of the 'temperature' key in the input data, we cannot definitively say \"always\".
