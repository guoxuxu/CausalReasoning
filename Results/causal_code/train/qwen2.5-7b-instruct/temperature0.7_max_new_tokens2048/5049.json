    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_sales` takes three parameters: `price`, `discount`, and `volume`.\n2. It calculates the `final_price` using the formula: `final_price = price * (1 - discount)`.\n3. Then it calculates `total_sales` using the formula: `total_sales = final_price * volume`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `discount` is set to zero:\n\n4. If `discount` is 0, then:\n   - `final_price = price * (1 - 0) = price`\n   - So, `final_price = price`\n\n5. Given the same `price` and `volume`, the calculation for `total_sales` would be:\n   - `total_sales = price * volume`\n\n6. Now, if we compare this to the original scenario where `discount` is not zero, but we keep `price` and `volume` the same:\n   - With a non-zero `discount`, `final_price` would be less than `price` because `final_price = price * (1 - discount)`.\n   - Therefore, `total_sales` would be less than `price * volume` because `total_sales = final_price * volume` and `final_price` is less than `price`.\n\n7. Since setting `discount` to zero results in `final_price` being equal to `price`, which is higher than when `discount` is applied, `total_sales` will indeed increase.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
