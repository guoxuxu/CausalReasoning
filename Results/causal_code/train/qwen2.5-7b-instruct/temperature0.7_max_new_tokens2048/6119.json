    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `updateTemperature` method is called with an external temperature (`externalTemp`).\n\n2. If `externalTemp < 0`, the `heatOn` flag is set to `true`.\n\n3. If `heatOn` is `true`, the current temperature (`currentTemp`) increases by 5.\n\n4. If `externalTemp >= 0`, the `heatOn` flag remains unchanged from its previous state.\n\n5. If `heatOn` is `false`, the current temperature decreases by 3.\n\n6. When `externalTemp < 0`, the `heatOn` flag becomes `true`, which means the current temperature will increase by 5.\n\n7. However, if the system was previously cooling (i.e., `heatOn` was `false`), then even though the new condition sets `heatOn` to `true`, the current temperature might still decrease by 3 before it has a chance to increase by 5.\n\n8. The key point is that the current temperature change depends on its previous state. If the system was cooling just before the external temperature dropped below 0, the temperature could still decrease by 3, making the net change not necessarily positive.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the current temperature does not necessarily have to increase when the external temperature drops below 0.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `updateTemperature` method is called with an `externalTemp` value.\n2. If `externalTemp < 0`, the `heatOn` flag is set to `true`.\n3. When `heatOn` is `true`, the `currentTemp` is incremented by 5.\n4. If `externalTemp >= 0`, the `heatOn` flag remains unchanged from its previous state.\n\nNow, specifically for the case where the external temperature drops below 0:\n- The `heatOn` flag is set to `true`.\n- This triggers the increment of `currentTemp` by 5.\n\nHowever, we need to consider what happens if the external temperature was already above 100, which would have previously turned off the heat (`heatOn = false`). In that case, even though the temperature drops below 0, `heatOn` would remain `false`, and `currentTemp` would not be incremented but rather decremented by 3.\n\nTherefore, the current temperature does not necessarily increase when the external temperature drops below 0 because it depends on the previous state of `heatOn`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `updateTemperature` method is called with an `externalTemp` value.\n2. If `externalTemp` is less than 0:\n   - `heatOn` is set to true.\n3. Regardless of the `heatOn` status, the method then checks if `heatOn` is true:\n   - If true, it increases `currentTemp` by 5.\n   - If false, it decreases `currentTemp` by 3.\n\nGiven that the `heatOn` is explicitly set to true when `externalTemp` drops below 0, the condition for increasing `currentTemp` by 5 is met. Therefore, the `currentTemp` will indeed increase when the external temperature drops below 0.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The `currentTemp` is not specified, and the `heatOn` state is initially unknown.\n\n2. **Update Logic**:\n   - If the `externalTemp` is less than 0, the system sets `heatOn` to `true`.\n   - If the `externalTemp` is greater than 100, the system sets `heatOn` to `false`.\n   - If `heatOn` is `true`, the `currentTemp` increases by 5.\n   - If `heatOn` is `false`, the `currentTemp` decreases by 3.\n\n3. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - When the `externalTemp` drops below 0, the system sets `heatOn` to `true`.\n   - Once `heatOn` is set to `true`, it will remain `true` unless the `externalTemp` exceeds 100, which is not relevant here as we are only considering the scenario where `externalTemp` is below 0.\n   - With `heatOn` being `true`, the `currentTemp` will increase by 5.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the `externalTemp` drops below 0, the `heatOn` state will be set to `true`, and the `currentTemp` will increase by 5.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer to the question \"If the external temperature drops below 0, will the current temperature necessarily increase?\" is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
