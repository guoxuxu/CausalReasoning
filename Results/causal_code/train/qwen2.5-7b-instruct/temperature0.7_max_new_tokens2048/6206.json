  "Question Type": "from effect to cause with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "By setting `c` to 30 through intervention and observing `d` as 35, we can deduce that the True branch of the conditional (`if b > 10`) was executed, implying `b > 10`. This is because the False branch (c - a) would not result in 35 when `c` is fixed to 30, as it would produce `c - 5 = 25`.",

  "causal_map_integration": "x directly influences b, which then directly influences c and d. If b is greater than 10, d becomes c plus a; otherwise, d becomes c minus a. Given c is fixed at 30, if d is 35, b must have been greater than 10 because 30 * 2 + 5 = 35, but 30 * 2 - 5 = 55, which does not match d = 35.",
