    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - The `Experiment` object is initialized with a given temperature.\n   - The light switch is initially off (`lightSwitch = false`).\n   - The plant has not grown yet (`hasGrown = false`).\n\n2. **Manual Actions**:\n   - We manually turn on the light: `toggleLightSwitch()` is called.\n     - This sets `lightSwitch` to `true`.\n   - We decrease the temperature to just above 20: `adjustTemperature(newTemp)` is called with `newTemp` slightly greater than 20.\n     - This sets `temperature` to the new value.\n\n3. **Check Growth Conditions**:\n   - The `checkGrowthConditions()` method is called after both actions.\n   - It checks two conditions:\n     - `temperature > 20`: Since we set the temperature to just above 20, this condition is true.\n     - `lightSwitch`: Since we turned the light on, this is also true.\n\n4. **Growth Condition**:\n   - If both conditions are true, `hasGrown` is set to `true`.\n\nGiven these steps, if we manually turn on the light and decrease the temperature to just above 20, the growth conditions will be met, and the plant will grow.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial state of the experiment:\n   - Temperature is set by the constructor.\n   - LightSwitch is initially false.\n   - HasGrown is initially false.\n\n2. Manually turning on the light:\n   - This would call `toggleLightSwitch()`, which sets `lightSwitch` to true.\n   - It also calls `checkGrowthConditions()`.\n\n3. Decreasing the temperature to just above 20:\n   - This would call `adjustTemperature(newTemp)`, where newTemp is slightly above 20.\n   - It also calls `checkGrowthConditions()`.\n\n4. Evaluating `checkGrowthConditions()`:\n   - The condition checks if `temperature > 20 && lightSwitch`.\n   - With the temperature just above 20 and the lightSwitch now true, this condition evaluates to true.\n   - Therefore, `hasGrown` is set to true.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Given that both conditions are met after manually turning on the light and decreasing the temperature just above 20, the plant will indeed grow.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - The `Experiment` class is initialized with a specific temperature.\n   - By default, the `lightSwitch` is set to `false`.\n   - `hasGrown` is also set to `false`.\n\n2. **Turning On the Light**:\n   - We call `toggleLightSwitch()` which sets `lightSwitch` to `true`.\n   - This triggers a call to `checkGrowthConditions()`.\n\n3. **Decreasing Temperature Just Above 20**:\n   - We call `adjustTemperature(int newTemp)` with a value slightly above 20 (e.g., 20.1).\n   - This updates the `temperature` to 20.1.\n   - This again triggers a call to `checkGrowthConditions()`.\n\n4. **Checking Growth Conditions**:\n   - In `checkGrowthConditions()`, it checks if `temperature > 20` AND `lightSwitch` is `true`.\n   - With `temperature` at 20.1 (which is greater than 20) and `lightSwitch` being `true`, the condition is met.\n   - Therefore, `hasGrown` is set to `true`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the plant will indeed grow under these conditions.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
