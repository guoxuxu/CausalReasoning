    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `applyDiscount` method checks if the provided `discountCode` is 'SAVE10'.\n2. If it is 'SAVE10', the method then multiplies `this.cartTotal` by 0.9.\n3. Multiplying by 0.9 is equivalent to reducing the value by 10%.\n4. This means that applying the 'SAVE10' discount directly decreases the `cartTotal` by 10%.\n\nGiven this logic, the `cartTotal` will indeed reflect a 10% decrease when the 'SAVE10' discount code is applied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `applyDiscount` method checks if the provided discount code is 'SAVE10'.\n2. If the condition is true, it applies the following line of code:\n   ```javascript\n   this.cartTotal *= 0.9;\n   ```\n3. Multiplying by 0.9 is mathematically equivalent to reducing the value by 10%. This is because:\n   - 0.9 is the same as 90/100 or 90%, which means keeping 90% of the original value.\n   - Therefore, 100% - 90% = 10% is removed.\n\n4. The `updateCartTotal` method is called after any changes to the products list, ensuring that the cartTotal is always up-to-date with the current total price of all products in the cart.\n\n5. Applying the 'SAVE10' discount directly modifies the `cartTotal` by reducing it by 10%.\n\nTherefore, applying the discount code 'SAVE10' will indeed result in a 10% decrease in the `cartTotal`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `OnlineShop` class has a method `applyDiscount(discountCode)` that checks if the discount code is 'SAVE10'.\n\n2. If the discount code is 'SAVE10', it applies the following line of code:\n   ```javascript\n   this.cartTotal *= 0.9;\n   ```\n\n3. This line multiplies the current value of `cartTotal` by 0.9, which is equivalent to reducing it by 10%.\n\n4. The `updateCartTotal()` method is called after adding or removing products to ensure `cartTotal` always reflects the correct sum of product prices.\n\n5. When the `applyDiscount('SAVE10')` method is called, it directly modifies the `cartTotal` by multiplying it with 0.9, effectively applying a 10% discount.\n\n6. There are no conditions or additional operations that would prevent or alter this behavior.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided code, applying the 'SAVE10' discount code will indeed result in a 10% decrease in the `cartTotal`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If the discount code matches 'SAVE10', it directly multiplies `this.cartTotal` by 0.9.\n3. This operation effectively reduces the `cartTotal` by 10%.\n\nThe key point here is that the `applyDiscount` method does not rely on the `updateCartTotal` method to recalculate the total; instead, it directly modifies the `cartTotal` property.\n\nTherefore, when the 'SAVE10' discount code is applied, the `cartTotal` will indeed reflect a 10% decrease.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `cartTotal` starts at 0 because no products have been added yet.\n\n2. **Adding Products**: When you call `addProduct(price)`, the price is added to the `products` array, and `updateCartTotal()` is called. This updates `cartTotal` to be the sum of all prices in `products`.\n\n3. **Removing Products**: When you call `removeProduct(index)`, the specified product is removed from the `products` array, and `updateCartTotal()` is called again, recalculating `cartTotal` as the sum of the remaining prices.\n\n4. **Applying Discount**: The `applyDiscount(discountCode)` method checks if the provided discount code matches 'SAVE10'.

This updates `cartTotal` by summing up all the prices in the `products` array.\n\n3. **Removing Products**: When `removeProduct(index)` is called, the specified product at the given index is removed from the `products` array, and again `updateCartTotal()` is called to recalculate `cartTotal`.\n\n4. **Applying Discount**: When `applyDiscount(discountCode)` is called with the discount code 'SAVE10', it checks if the discount code matches and then applies a 10% discount to `cartTotal`.
