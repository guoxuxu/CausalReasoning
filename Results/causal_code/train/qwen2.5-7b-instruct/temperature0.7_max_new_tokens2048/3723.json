    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `traffic_signal` determines whether the signal will blink based on the `emergency_status`.\n\n2. In the provided code:\n   - `emergency_status` is determined by `is_emergency()`, which randomly returns either `True` or `False`.\n   - If `emergency_status` is `True`, the `traffic_signal` function returns 'blink'.\n   - If `emergency_status` is `False`, it returns the duration.\n\n3. The question asks if the signal is blinking, we need to check if `emergency_status` was `True`.\n\n4. From the logic in `traffic_signal`, the only way the signal can blink is if `emergency_status` is `True`.\n\n5. Therefore, if the signal is indeed blinking, it means there was an emergency declared.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `traffic_signal` function determines the status of the signal based on two parameters:\n   - `duration`: The length of time the signal should be green (or red, depending on context).\n   - `emergency_status`: A boolean indicating whether an emergency is active.\n\n2. If `emergency_status` is True, the function returns 'blink'.\n\n3. If `emergency_status` is False, the function returns the `duration`.\n\n4. In the provided code, `emergency_status` is determined by the `is_emergency()` function, which randomly returns either True or False.\n\n5. The question asks: \"If the signal is blinking, was there an emergency declared?\"\n\n6. According to the logic in the `traffic_signal` function, the only way the signal can blink is if `emergency_status` is True.\n\nTherefore, if the signal is indeed blinking, it must mean that an emergency was declared.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `traffic_signal` function determines whether the signal should blink based on the `emergency_status` parameter.\n2. If `emergency_status` is `True`, the function returns 'blink'.\n3. If `emergency_status` is `False`, the function returns the `duration`.\n\nGiven that the signal is currently blinking, we can conclude that `emergency_status` must be `True`.\n\nTherefore, if the signal is blinking, it means there was an emergency declared.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Variables:**\n   - `pedestrian_count`: This variable determines the duration of the traffic signal.\n   - `duration`: The length of time the traffic signal stays on based on the pedestrian count.\n   - `emergency_status`: This variable determines whether the signal will blink or stay on for its normal duration.\n   - `signal_status`: This is the output of the function `traffic_signal` which returns either 'blink' (if there's an emergency) or the duration of the signal (if there isn't).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Functions:**\n   - `generate_pedestrian_count()`: Generates a random number between 0 and 20.\n   - `adjust_signal_duration(pedestrian_count)`: If the pedestrian count is greater than 10, it sets the duration to 60 seconds; otherwise, it sets it to 30 seconds.\n   - `is_emergency()`: Randomly returns `True` or `False`.\n   - `traffic_signal(duration, emergency_status)`: Returns 'blink' if there's an emergency (`emergency_status` is `True`), otherwise, it returns the duration.\n\n3. **Determining Signal Status:**\n   - If `emergency_status` is `True`, the signal status will be 'blink'.\n   - If `emergency_status` is `False`, the signal status will be the duration (either 30 or 60 seconds).\n\n4. **Question Analysis:**\n   - We need to determine if the signal is blinking given that it is indeed blinking.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the signal is blinking, by definition of the `traffic_signal` function, `emergency_status` must be `True`.\n\nTherefore, if the signal is blinking, then there was an emergency declared.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",

If `emergency_status` is True, `signal_status` will be 'blink'.\n   - `pedestrian_count` indirectly affects `duration`, which is used to determine the signal status, but does not directly affect `signal_status`.\n\n3. **Question Analysis:**\n   - The question asks if the signal is blinking, was there an emergency declared?\n   - From the code, we can see that the signal blinks only when there is an emergency (`emergency_status` is True).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - If `signal_status` is 'blink', then `emergency_status` must be True.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
