  "Explanation": "While the awareness campaign initially adds 1000 to the voter turnout, the same exact increase could theoretically be achieved by equivalent changes in population or fees independently, or combinations thereof. Without isolating the campaign effect completely, such an exact match in numbers doesn't definitively attribute the cause to the campaign.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - `total_population` is 5000.\n   - `entry_fees` is 500.\n   - `campaign_active` is True.\n\n2. **Calculate Voter Turnout Without Campaign**:\n   - The formula for voter turnout without the awareness campaign is `(population - fees) * 0.5`.\n   - Plugging in the values: `(5000 - 500) * 0.5 = 4500 * 0.5 = 2250`.\n\n3. **Effect of Awareness Campaign**:\n   - If the awareness campaign is active (`awareness_campaign` is True), the voter turnout increases by 1000.\n   - Therefore, with the campaign, the voter turnout would be `2250 + 1000 = 3250`.\n\n4. **Check if Increase is Exactly 1000 Votes**:\n   - The increase from 2250 to 3250 is indeed 1000 votes.\n   - However, we need to determine if this increase is solely due to the awareness campaign.\n\n5. **Consider Other Factors**:\n   - The problem does not mention any other factors that could affect voter turnout besides the population, fees, and the awareness campaign.\n   - Since the only factor affecting the turnout beyond the initial calculation is the awareness campaign, and it results in an exact 1000 vote increase, we can conclude that the increase is solely due to the awareness campaign.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Voter Turnout Calculation**: \n   - The formula for voter turnout is \\((\\text{population} - \\text{fees}) \\times 0.5\\).\n   - With the given values: \\(5000 - 500 = 4500\\), and \\(4500 \\times 0.5 = 2250\\).\n\n2. **Effect of Awareness Campaign**:\n   - If the awareness campaign is active, it adds 1000 to the voter turnout.\n   - So, with the campaign active, the voter turnout would be \\(2250 + 1000 = 3250\\).\n\n3. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if the voter turnout increase of exactly 1000 votes was solely due to the awareness campaign.\n   - Without the awareness campaign, the turnout would have been 2250.\n   - With the awareness campaign, the turnout is 3250.\n   - The difference is \\(3250 - 2250 = 1000\\).\n\nGiven that the turnout increased by exactly 1000 votes, and this increase only happens when the awareness campaign is active, we can conclude that the increase was solely due to the awareness campaign.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
