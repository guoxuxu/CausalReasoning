    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `playGame` method is defined with two actions:\n   - If `hasPowerUp` is true, it adds 100 to the `score`.\n   - It always adds 10 to the `score`.\n\n2. The key point here is the condition `if (hasPowerUp)` which determines whether the 100 points are added.\n\n3. Regardless of the value of `hasPowerUp`, the `score` will always have 10 added to it because this addition happens regardless of the condition.\n\n4. If `hasPowerUp` is true, then 100 points are added on top of the 10 points, so the `score` increases by 110.\n5. If `hasPowerUp` is false, then only 10 points are added, so the `score` increases by 10.\n\nIn both cases, the `score` increases. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the `playGame` method step by step:\n\n1. The method `playGame` first checks if `hasPowerUp` is `true`.\n2. If `hasPowerUp` is `true`, it adds 100 to the `score`.\n3. Regardless of whether `hasPowerUp` is `true` or `false`, it then adds 10 to the `score`.\n\nGiven this logic:\n- If `hasPowerUp` is `true`, the `score` will be increased by 100 and then by 10, resulting in an increase of 110.\n- If `hasPowerUp` is `false`, the `score` will only be increased by 10.\n\nIn both cases, the `score` will always increase, either by 110 or by 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `playGame` method is called.\n2. Inside `playGame`, there is an `if` statement that checks if `hasPowerUp` is true.\n3. If `hasPowerUp` is true, then `score += 100`.\n4. Regardless of whether `hasPowerUp` is true or false, the line `score += 10;` will always execute.\n\nNow, let's consider the two scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: `hasPowerUp` is true**\n  - In this case, both `score += 100;` and `score += 10;` will execute.\n  - The total increase in score would be `100 + 10 = 110`.\n\n- **Scenario 2: `hasPowerUp` is false**\n  - Here, only `score += 10;` will execute.\n  - The total increase in score would be `10`.\n\nIn both scenarios, the `score` does increase, but the amount of increase varies based on the value of `hasPowerUp`.\n\nSince the `score` always increases regardless of the value of `hasPowerUp`, we can conclude that the statement is correct.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

However, the question specifically asks if the score \"always\" increases, which implies it should happen every single time without any exceptions.\n\nThe key point here is that the score will increase by at least 10 points in every call to `playGame`, regardless of the state of `hasPowerUp`.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the score will always increase when `playGame` is called.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `playGame` method checks if `hasPowerUp` is true.\n2. If `hasPowerUp` is true, it adds 100 to `score`.\n3. Regardless of whether `hasPowerUp` is true or false, it adds 10 to `score`.\n\nGiven these steps, we can analyze the conditions under which `score` increases:\n\n- If `hasPowerUp` is true when `playGame` is called:\n  - `score` will first increase by 100 due to the condition `if (hasPowerUp)`\n  - Then, `score` will increase by another 10, so `score` increases by 110 in total.\n\n- If `hasPowerUp` is false when `playGame` is called:\n  - The `if (hasPowerUp)` condition will not be met, but `score` will still increase by 10.\n\nIn both scenarios, `score` always increases. It either increases by 110 (if `hasPowerUp` is true) or by 10 (if `hasPowerUp` is false).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `playGame` method is called.\n2.

In both scenarios, the score does increase, but not necessarily by the same amount. However, the question asks if the score \"always increases,\" which it does in both cases.\n\n4. The key point is that the score will never decrease or remain the same when `playGame` is called, regardless of the initial state of `hasPowerUp`.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logic in the `playGame` method, the score will always increase when the method is called.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Before calling `playGame`, the value of `score` and `hasPowerUp` can be anything.\n\n2. **Calling `enablePowerUp()`**: This method sets `hasPowerUp` to `true`. If `playGame` is called after `enablePowerUp`, the condition `if (hasPowerUp)` will be true, and `score` will increase by 100.\n\n3. **Calling `disablePowerUp()`**: This method sets `hasPowerUp` to `false`. If `playGame` is called after `disablePowerUp`, the condition `if (hasPowerUp)` will be false, and `score` will only increase by 10.\n\n4. **Direct Increase**: Regardless of whether `hasPowerUp` is `true` or `false`, `score` will always increase by 10 when `playGame` is called.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that `score` will always increase by at least 10 when `playGame` is called.
