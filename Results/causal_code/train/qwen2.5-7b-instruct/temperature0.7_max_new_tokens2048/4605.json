    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with a ShoppingCart object.\n2. Two items are added to the cart:\n   - A shirt priced at $20\n   - Pants priced at $40\n3. The total is calculated as $20 + $40 = $60.\n4. A 'SALE20' discount code is applied to the cart.\n5. According to the ShoppingCart class definition, if the discount code matches 'SALE20', the total cost is multiplied by 0.8 (which is equivalent to applying an 80% price after a 20% discount).\n\nSo, the calculation for the new total after applying the 'SALE20' discount would be:\n\\[ \\text{New Total} = \\$60 \\times 0.8 = \\$48 \\]\n\nSince the new total ($48) is less than the original total ($60), the total cost of the items does indeed decrease.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
