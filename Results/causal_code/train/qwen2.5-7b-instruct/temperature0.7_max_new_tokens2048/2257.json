    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthSystem` class represents a person's health status.\n2. Initially, the person is not vaccinated (`self.vaccinated = False`) and does not have a fever (`self.has_fever = False`).\n3. The intervention is to administer a vaccine using the `administer_vaccine()` method. This sets `self.vaccinated = True`.\n4. Next, the person catches a cold using the `catch_cold()` method. According to the provided causal relationship `catch_cold → has_fever`, if the person is not vaccinated, they will develop a fever.\n5. However, in our scenario, the person has just been vaccinated, so `self.vaccinated` is `True`.\n6.
