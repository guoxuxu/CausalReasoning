  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The increaseTemperature method adds degrees to the temperature and sets isRainy to true if the temperature exceeds 30. A 15-degree increase from the default of 20 results in 35 degrees, which surpasses the 30-degree threshold, activating the condition for rain.",
  "causal_map": "increaseTemperature → isRainy; temperature → isRainy",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing the temperature by 15 degrees may lead to rain, as higher temperatures increase the likelihood of rain.",
