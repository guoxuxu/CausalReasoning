    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `PollSystem` class maintains two main pieces of data:\n   - `totalVotes`: A counter for the total number of votes cast.\n   - `votesPerCandidate`: A hashmap that maps each candidate to their respective vote count.\n\n2. The `castVote` method is used to add a vote for a candidate:\n   - It increments `totalVotes` by 1.\n   - It updates the vote count for the specified candidate in `votesPerCandidate`.\n\n3. Key point: Every time `castVote` is called, it always increments `totalVotes` by 1, regardless of which candidate is voted for.\n\n4. However, the increment of `totalVotes` does not necessarily mean that a specific candidate's vote count has increased:\n   - If multiple candidates are voted for simultaneously (or if the same candidate is voted for more than once), `totalVotes` will still increase, but the individual vote counts for each candidate could remain unchanged.\n\n5. Therefore, while an increase in `totalVotes` indicates that at least one more vote has been cast, it does not guarantee that a specific candidate's vote count has increased.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `PollSystem` class maintains two main pieces of data:\n   - `totalVotes`: An integer that tracks the total number of votes cast.\n   - `votesPerCandidate`: A HashMap that maps each candidate to their respective vote count.\n\n2. The `castVote` method is responsible for incrementing the total votes and updating the candidate's vote count:\n   - It increments `totalVotes`.\n   - It updates the `votesPerCandidate` map by getting the current vote count for the candidate (using `getOrDefault`), adding one to it, and then putting the updated count back into the map.\n\n3. For `totalVotes` to increase, at least one vote must have been cast:\n   - This means that `castVote` has been called with a candidate name as an argument.\n\n4. However, calling `castVote` does not necessarily mean that any specific candidate's vote count has increased:\n   - If the same candidate is voted for multiple times, their vote count will indeed increase.\n   - But if different candidates are voted for, the vote counts for those other candidates will increase instead.\n\n5. Therefore, while `totalVotes` increasing indicates that at least one vote was cast, it does not guarantee that a specific candidate's votes have increased.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `PollSystem` class has a method `castVote(String candidate)` which is used to record a vote for a candidate.\n2. When `castVote` is called, two things happen:\n   - `totalVotes` is incremented by 1.\n   - The vote count for the specified candidate is incremented by 1.\n3. The `totalVotes` variable counts all votes cast so far.\n4. Each call to `castVote` increments both `totalVotes` and the count for the specific candidate.\n5. However, `totalVotes` can increase without necessarily increasing the count for a specific candidate if multiple candidates are voted for.\n\nGiven these points, it's not guaranteed that an increase in `totalVotes` will always correspond to an increase in the votes for a specific candidate. `totalVotes` could increase due to votes being cast for different candidates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `PollSystem` class has two main components:\n   - `totalVotes`: An integer that tracks the total number of votes cast.\n   - `votesPerCandidate`: A HashMap that stores the number of votes for each candidate.\n\n2. The `castVote` method:\n   - Increments `totalVotes` by 1.\n   - Increments the count for the specified candidate in `votesPerCandidate`.\n\n3. Key points to consider:\n   - Every time `castVote` is called, both `totalVotes` and the relevant candidate's vote count in `votesPerCandidate` increase.\n   - However, `totalVotes` is a cumulative count of all votes, while the candidate-specific counts in `votesPerCandidate` only reflect the votes for that particular candidate.\n\n4. Implication analysis:\n   - If `totalVotes` increases, it means at least one vote was cast (or more than one if multiple votes were cast).\n   - This increase could be due to a vote for any candidate or even an increase in votes for multiple candidates.\n   - Therefore, an increase in `totalVotes` does not necessarily mean that a specific candidate's votes have increased; it could be due to other candidates' votes increasing as well.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding `totalVotes`**: This variable keeps track of the total number of votes cast in the system. It increments every time `castVote` is called.\n\n2. **Understanding `votesPerCandidate`**: This is a HashMap that stores the number of votes each candidate has received. The key is the candidate name, and the value is the count of votes for that candidate.\n\n3. **Behavior of `castVote` method**:\n   - When `castVote` is called with a candidate name, `totalVotes` is incremented by 1.\n   - The method then checks if the candidate already exists in `votesPerCandidate`. If they do, their vote count is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry is added with a count of 1.\n\n4. **Implication**:\n   - For `totalVotes` to increase, at least one vote must have been cast.\n   - However, just because `totalVotes` increases doesn't necessarily mean a specific candidate's votes also increased. It could be that the vote was cast for a candidate who already had votes (thus increasing their count), or it could be for a new candidate (thus adding a new entry).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - An increase in `totalVotes` can happen without any specific candidate's votes increasing if all votes were cast for candidates who already had votes, thus incrementing their existing counts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
