    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `product_sales` takes two parameters: `increase_advertising` and `current_sales`.\n2.

The new sales are calculated as `current_sales + sales_jump`.\n\nNow, let's focus on the question: Can we infer that the increase in advertising was sufficient to create traffic above 100 if the sales jump was observed as 20?\n\n6. For `sales_jump` to be 20, the condition `increased_traffic > 100` must be true.\n7.
