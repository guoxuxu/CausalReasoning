    "Let's break down the scoring logic in the `calculate_scores` function:\n\n1. If `item['age'] > 50`, add 20 points.\n2. If `item['has_experience']` is True, add 30 points.\n3. If both conditions (age > 50 and has_experience) are met, add an additional 10 points.\n\nNow let's consider the scenario where an older person (over 50 years) without previous experience is modified to have experience.\n\n### Initial State:\n- Age > 50: Score = 20\n- No Experience: Score = 20\n\n### Modified State:\n- Age > 50: Score = 20\n- With Experience: Score = 20 + 30 = 50\n- Additional 10 points because both conditions are now met: Score = 50 + 10 = 60\n\nThe score increases from 20 to 60 when the person gains experience.\n\nTherefore, the score definitely increases when an older person (over 50 years) without previous experience is modified to have experience.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
