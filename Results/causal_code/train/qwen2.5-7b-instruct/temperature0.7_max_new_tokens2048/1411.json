  "Explanation": "According to the code, setting the temperature to below 5 causes the value of 'isRainy' to change to true due to the direct condition in the 'setTemperature' method.",
  "causal_map": "temperature < 5 → isRainy; temperature → isRainy",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting the temperature to 4 directly causes isRainy to become true, as temperatures below 5 lead to rain.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `setTemperature` method takes an integer parameter `newTemp` and sets the instance variable `temperature` to this value.\n2. If the new temperature (`newTemp`) is less than 5, the method sets `isRainy` to true.\n\nGiven that we are setting the temperature to 4, let's check the conditions:\n- The new temperature is 4, which is indeed less than 5.\n- According to the logic in the `setTemperature` method, since the temperature is less than 5, `isRainy` will be set to true.\n\nTherefore, setting the temperature to 4 will cause `isRainy` to become true.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The `temperature` is set to 4.\n2. We check the condition: `4 < 5` which evaluates to `true`.\n3.
