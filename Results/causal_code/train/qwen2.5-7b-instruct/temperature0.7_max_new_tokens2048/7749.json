    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand the relationship between drug dose and patient response as defined in the code.\n\n2.

Now, let's consider a drug dose of 70:\n   - Again, the base health remains 100.\n   - Since 70 > 50, it also falls into the high-dose category.\n   - The reduction in health is calculated as: (base_health - (drug_dose * 0.8))\n   - So, for 70 mg: 100 - (70 * 0.8) = 100 - 56 = 44\n\n4.
