    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `analyze_sales` calculates `final_sales` based on the conditions provided.\n2. There are three conditions to consider for calculating `sales_increase`:\n   - If `data['promotion']` is True and `data['season']` is 'Summer', then `sales_increase` is set to 15.\n   - If `data['promotion']` is True and `data['season']` is not 'Summer', then `sales_increase` is set to 10.\n   - Otherwise (if `data['promotion']` is False), `sales_increase` is set to 5.\n3. The question asks if a 15 unit increase in `final_sales` means the season was necessarily Summer.\n4. According to the conditions, a 15 unit increase in `sales_increase` only happens when both `data['promotion']` is True and `data['season']` is 'Summer'.\n5. Therefore, if `final_sales` shows a 15 unit increase, it must be because `data['promotion']` was True and the season was Summer.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

From the conditions, we see that a 15 unit increase occurs only when both `data['promotion']` is True and `data['season']` is 'Summer'.\n\n5. However, if `data['promotion']` is True and `data['season']` is 'Summer', we get a 15 unit increase. This means that a 15 unit increase does indicate that the season is Summer, as long as there is a promotion.\n\n6. But, it's important to note that a 15 unit increase could also happen if `data['promotion']` is False (and thus not considered in the conditions leading to 15), but since the conditions explicitly state that for a 15 unit increase, `data['season']` must be 'Summer', we can conclude that if a 15 unit increase occurs, the season must indeed be Summer.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
