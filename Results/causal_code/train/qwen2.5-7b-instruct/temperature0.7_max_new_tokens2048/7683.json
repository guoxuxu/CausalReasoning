  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Setting all 'ages' to 30 normalizes part of the computation for 'salary', eliminating variation from ages. Though 'salary' still involves random categories and their respective age increases, the intervention stabilizes one key variable, illustrating a controlled, causal impact from an intervention (setting ages) to an effect (salary normalization).",

  "causal_map_integration": "Setting all elements in 'ages' to 30 will change the resulting 'salary' values because 'ages' → 'category_labels' → 'category_names' → 'salary'. Adjusting 'ages' directly influences 'category_labels', which in turn affects 'category_names' and subsequently 'salary'. Additionally, 'ages' directly causes 'salary'. Therefore, changing 'ages' will lead to different 'salary' values.",
