  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "The intervention fixes the base_sales at 400, decoupling it from the influence of competitors_nearby defined in the if-else condition. Hence, changes in the number of competitors will no longer affect the predicted_sales, since the base_sales component of the predicted_sales equation remains constant.",

  "causal_map_integration": "Store area directly influences predicted sales through its effect on the enhanced store area. Competitors nearby determine the base sales level, which in turn affects the predicted sales. Reducing competitors nearby decreases the base sales, while increasing the store area enhances the predicted sales.",
