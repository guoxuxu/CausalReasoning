    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `likelihood_of_rain` method has three conditions:\n   - If `humidity > 80` and `temperature < 20`, it returns 'High'.\n   - If `humidity > 60` but not necessarily `temperature < 20`, it returns 'Medium'.\n   - Otherwise, it returns 'Low'.\n\n2. We're specifically interested in when the method returns 'High'.\n\n3. For the method to return 'High', both of these conditions must be true:\n   - `humidity > 80`\n   - `temperature < 20`\n\n4. The question asks if we can infer that the temperature must be below 20 when the likelihood is 'High'.\n\n5. Based on the conditions for returning 'High', we can see that one of the conditions explicitly states `temperature < 20`.\n\nTherefore, if the `likelihood_of_rain` returns 'High', we can indeed infer that the temperature must be below 20.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

For 'High' likelihood, there are two possible scenarios:\n   - Scenario A: `humidity > 80` AND `temperature < 20`\n   - Scenario B: `humidity > 80` (no specific condition on temperature)\n\n4. In Scenario A, both `humidity > 80` AND `temperature < 20` are true.\n   \n5. In Scenario B, only `humidity > 80` is true, and there is no restriction on temperature.\n\n6. Therefore, while `humidity > 80` is a requirement for 'High' likelihood, it does not necessarily mean that `temperature < 20` is always true when `likelihood_of_rain` returns 'High'. It could be true or false based on which of the two scenarios applies.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

We need to determine if the temperature must be below 20 when the likelihood is 'High'.\n\n3. From the conditions above, only one of them explicitly requires the temperature to be below 20 (`humidity > 80 AND temperature < 20`).\n\n4. However, there is another way to get a 'High' likelihood: `humidity > 60`. This does not specify any temperature condition.\n\n5. Therefore, it is possible for the likelihood to be 'High' even if the temperature is not below 20, as long as the humidity is greater than 60 but not more than 80.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot infer that the temperature must be below 20 if the 'likelihood_of_rain' returns 'High'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The question specifically asks if we can infer that the temperature must be below 20 when the likelihood is 'High'.\n\n4. From the conditions, we see that while one path to 'High' likelihood requires `temperature < 20`, another path does not require this condition at all (`humidity > 60` alone).\n\nTherefore, based on the given logic, we cannot infer that the temperature must be below 20 just because the likelihood of rain is 'High'.

We need to determine if the temperature must be below 20 when the likelihood of rain is 'High'.\n\n3. For Condition 1, the temperature must be below 20.\n\n4. For Condition 2, the humidity is between 60 and 80 (inclusive). If the temperature were 20 or above, the method would return 'Medium' instead of 'High'. Therefore, the temperature must be below 20 for this condition to hold true.\n\n5. For Condition 3, the humidity is above 80.
