    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `calculate_scholarship` method determines the scholarship based on the student's age:\n   - If age < 18, scholarship = 2000\n   - If 18 ≤ age < 25, scholarship = 1500\n   - If age ≥ 25, scholarship = 1000\n\n2. We create a list of students with different ages:\n   - Student 1: Age 17, Scholarship = 2000\n   - Student 2: Age 20, Scholarship = 1500\n   - Student 3: Age 26, Scholarship = 1000\n\n3. From these rules, we can see that:\n   - A younger student (under 25) has a higher scholarship amount than an older student.\n   - Specifically, a student under 18 gets the highest scholarship amount of 2000.\n\n4. Therefore, a higher scholarship amount does indeed imply that the student is younger, at least up to the age of 25.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `calculate_scholarship` method determines the scholarship based on the student's age:\n   - If age < 18, scholarship = 2000\n   - If 18 ≤ age < 25, scholarship = 1500\n   - If age ≥ 25, scholarship = 1000\n\n2. We have three students with different ages:\n   - Student 1: 17 years old (gets 2000)\n   - Student 2: 20 years old (gets 1500)\n   - Student 3: 26 years old (gets 1000)\n\n3. Let's compare the scholarship amounts:\n   - Student 1 (17) has the highest scholarship of 2000\n   - Student 2 (20) has a lower scholarship of 1500\n   - Student 3 (26) has the lowest scholarship of 1000\n\n4. We can see that the student with the highest scholarship (17 years old) is indeed younger than the student with the second-highest scholarship (20 years old).\n\n5. However, we need to check if this relationship holds true for all students:\n   - The student with the second-highest scholarship (20 years old) is not younger than the student with the highest scholarship (17 years old).\n   - The student with the lowest scholarship (26 years old) is older than both other students.\n\nTherefore, a higher scholarship amount does not always imply that the student is younger. It only implies that the student is younger within the specific age ranges defined in the code.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

We can see that the scholarship decreases as the age increases, within the given ranges.\n\n3. A higher scholarship amount corresponds to a younger age range:\n   - 2000 (highest) for ages < 18\n   - 1500 for ages between 18 and 25\n   - 1000 (lowest) for ages ≥ 25\n\n4.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's look at how scholarships are calculated based on age:\n   - If age < 18, scholarship = 2000\n   - If 18 ≤ age < 25, scholarship = 1500\n   - If age ≥ 25, scholarship = 1000\n\n2. Now, let's consider the implications of these rules:\n   - The youngest group (age < 18) gets the highest scholarship (2000)\n   - As age increases, the scholarship decreases\n\n3. This pattern suggests that a higher scholarship amount does indeed imply a younger student, as the maximum scholarship is given to the youngest age group.\n\n4. Let's verify with the example provided:\n   - Student 17: Age < 18 → Scholarship = 2000\n   - Student 20: 18 ≤ age < 25 → Scholarship = 1500\n   - Student 26: age ≥ 25 → Scholarship = 1000\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that a higher scholarship amount does imply the student is younger.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have a `Student` class with an `age` attribute and a calculated `scholarship`.\n\n2.

We create three students with ages 17, 20, and 26.\n\n4. Let's determine their scholarships:\n   - Age 17: $2000\n   - Age 20: $1500\n   - Age 26: $1000\n\n5. Now, let's consider the relationship between age and scholarship:\n   - The scholarship decreases as age increases within the defined ranges.\n   - There is a direct inverse relationship between age and scholarship.\n\n6.
