    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Stock**: The initial stock of apples is 50.\n2. **Order Quantity**: A customer orders 45 apples.\n3. **Stock Update**: After the order, the stock of apples will be updated as follows:\n   - Initial stock: 50\n   - Ordered quantity: -45\n   - Updated stock: 50 - 45 = 5\n\n4. **Minimum Threshold Check**: The minimum threshold for apples is 10.\n5. **Restock Condition**: The restock action is triggered if the stock falls below the minimum threshold.\n6. **Current Stock vs Minimum Threshold**: \n   - Current stock: 5\n   - Minimum threshold: 10\n   - Since 5 < 10, the condition is met.\n\nTherefore, the restock action will be triggered.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
