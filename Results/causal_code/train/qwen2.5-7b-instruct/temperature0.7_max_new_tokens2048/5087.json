    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `add_shipment` method is responsible for adding new books to the inventory.\n2. If a book already exists in the inventory, its quantity is increased.\n3. If the total quantity of a book exceeds 50 after the addition, the following happens:\n   - For every 10 books above 50, 1 credit is added.\n   - The inventory quantity is capped at 50.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the inventory exceeds 50 books:\n\n4. When the inventory of a book exceeds 50, the excess quantity is calculated as `(self.inventory[book] - 50)` divided by 10.\n5. This excess quantity is then used to increase the store's credits by that amount.\n\nTherefore, if a new shipment causes the inventory to exceed 50 books, the store credits will indeed increase based on the excess quantity.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `add_shipment` method adds new books to the inventory.\n2. If the inventory for any book exceeds 50, it triggers a condition where:\n   - The excess quantity (inventory - 50) is divided by 10.\n   - This result is added to the `credits`.\n3. The division by 10 ensures that even small excesses contribute to the credits, though not continuously.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude:\n\n- Whenever a new shipment causes the inventory to exceed 50 books for any title, the `add_shipment` method will increase the store's credits based on the excess quantity.\n- Since the excess quantity is always positive when the inventory exceeds 50, the credits will indeed increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `add_shipment` method is called when a new shipment is added.\n2. For each book in the shipment, it checks if the book already exists in the inventory.\n3. If the book already exists, it increments the quantity by the amount in the shipment.\n4. If the book does not exist, it adds the book to the inventory with the quantity from the shipment.\n5. After updating the inventory, it checks if the current quantity of the book exceeds 50.\n6. If the quantity exceeds 50, it calculates the excess quantity as `(quantity - 50)` and divides it by 10.\n7. This calculated value is then added to the `credits` attribute of the `BookStore` instance.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the inventory exceeds 50 books for a specific book:\n\n- When the inventory exceeds 50 books, the script calculates the excess quantity `(quantity - 50) // 10`.\n- This excess quantity is added to the `credits` attribute.\n- Since the credits are directly incremented based on the excess quantity, which increases with more books added beyond 50, the credits will indeed increase if the inventory exceeds 50 books for any book.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `add_shipment` method is called when a new shipment of books arrives.\n2. For each book in the shipment, it checks if the book is already in the inventory.\n3. If the book is already in the inventory, it adds the new quantity to the existing quantity.\n4. If the book is not in the inventory, it initializes it with the new quantity.\n5. After updating the inventory, it checks if the total quantity of the book exceeds 50.\n6. If the quantity exceeds 50, it calculates the excess quantity (`quantity - 50`) and adds one-tenth of this excess to the credits.\n\nThe key point here is the condition that triggers the addition of credits: when the inventory of a book exceeds 50.\n\nTherefore, if a new shipment causes the inventory of any book to exceed 50, the store's credits will indeed increase based on the excess quantity.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `add_shipment` method increases the inventory for each book added.\n2. If the inventory for any book exceeds 50, the method calculates the excess and converts it into credits.\n3. Specifically, the line `self.credits += (self.inventory[book] - 50) // 10` adds credits based on how much the inventory exceeds 50, divided by 10.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when inventory exceeds 50:\n\n- For every 10 books over 50, the store earns 1 credit.\n- This means that as long as there is an ongoing addition to the inventory that causes it to exceed 50, the store will continue to earn credits at a rate of 1 credit for every 10 extra books.\n\nTherefore, if a new shipment is added and the total inventory for any book exceeds 50, the store credits will indeed increase according to the described logic.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `add_shipment` method is called with a dictionary of books and their quantities.\n\n2. For each book in the shipment:\n   - If the book is already in the inventory, its quantity is increased.\n   - If the book is not in the inventory, it is added with the given quantity.\n\n3. After updating the inventory:\n   - If the quantity of any book exceeds 50, the excess is converted into credits.\n   - Specifically, for each book where the quantity exceeds 50, the number of credits earned is `(quantity - 50) // 10`.\n\n4. The `//` operator performs integer division, so only full sets of 10 overstocked books contribute to credits.\n\n5. Credits are only added when the inventory exceeds 50 books, and they are calculated based on how much over 50 the inventory is.\n\n6. The process of adding more books can repeatedly trigger the credit calculation as long as the inventory exceeds 50 for any book.\n\nTherefore, if a new shipment causes the inventory to exceed 50 books for any title, and this condition persists, the store's credits will indeed increase over time.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
