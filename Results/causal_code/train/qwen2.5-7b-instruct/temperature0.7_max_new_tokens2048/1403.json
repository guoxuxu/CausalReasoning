  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The sales formula increases with an increase in advertising (with coefficients 1.2 on Sundays and 1.1 on other days), so increasing advertising, while keeping other factors like price and day constant, would lead to increased sales.",
  "causal_map": "advertising → sales; price → sales",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in the advertising budget directly increases sales, while a decrease in price also directly increases sales.",

    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `sales_prediction` takes three parameters: `price`, `advertising`, and `day_of_week`.\n\n2. If `day_of_week` is 'Sunday', the sales calculation includes an additional multiplier of 1.5:\n   sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.2) * 1.5\n\n3. For any other day, the sales calculation is:\n   sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.1)\n\n4. In both cases, the sales formula includes the `advertising` variable multiplied by a factor greater than 1 (1.2 for Sunday, 1.1 otherwise).\n\n5. This means that as the `advertising` budget increases, the term `advertising * 1.2` or `advertising * 1.1` will also increase.\n\n6. Since the overall sales calculation is dependent on this increased value, sales will indeed increase when the advertising budget is increased, assuming no changes in other variables.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

For non-Sunday days:\n   - Sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.1)\n   - Increasing advertising would increase the term `(advertising * 1.1)`, thus increasing overall sales.\n\n4. For Sunday:\n   - Sales = (price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.2) * 1.5\n   - Similarly, increasing advertising would increase the term `(advertising * 1.2)`, which when multiplied by 1.5 would still result in an increase in sales.\n\n5.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `sales_prediction` takes three parameters: `price`, `advertising`, and `day_of_week`.\n\n2.

Both coefficients (1.2 and 1.1) are greater than 1, which means they amplify the effect of `advertising` on `sales`.\n\n6.
