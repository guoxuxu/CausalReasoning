    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `check_health` has two parameters:\n   - `system_status`: which can be either 'good' or 'bad'.\n   - `error_logs`: which can be either True (indicating error logs exist) or False (no error logs).\n\n2. We need to determine under what conditions the function returns the message 'System failure imminent'.\n\n3. Looking at the conditional logic in the function:\n   - If `system_status` is 'good' and `error_logs` is True, it returns 'Check logs for warnings'.\n   - If `system_status` is 'good' and `error_logs` is False, it returns 'System is healthy'.\n   - If `system_status` is 'bad' and `error_logs` is True, it returns 'System failure imminent'.\n   - Otherwise, it returns 'Status unclear, check manually'.\n\n4. From the logic above, we can see that 'System failure imminent' is only returned when both `system_status` is 'bad' and `error_logs` is True.\n\nTherefore, the message 'System failure imminent' does indeed imply that there were error logs and the system status was 'bad'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `check_health` has three main conditions to evaluate:\n   - When `system_status` is 'good' and there are no error logs\n   - When `system_status` is 'good' but there are error logs\n   - When `system_status` is 'bad' and there are error logs\n\n2. The only condition that results in the message 'System failure imminent' is when:\n   - `system_status` is 'bad'\n   - There are error logs\n\n3. This means that for the message 'System failure imminent' to be returned, both of these specific conditions must be met.\n\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the message 'System failure imminent' does indeed imply that there were error logs and the system status was 'bad'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the conditions in the `check_health` function to determine if 'System failure imminent' implies that there were error logs and the system status was 'bad'.\n\n1. **Condition 1:** `system_status == 'good' and not error_logs`\n   - This returns \"System is healthy\".\n   \n2. **Condition 2:** `system_status == 'good' and error_logs`\n   - This returns \"Check logs for warnings\".\n\n3. **Condition 3:** `system_status == 'bad' and error_logs`\n   - This returns \"System failure imminent\".\n\n4. **Else Condition:**\n   - `return 'Status unclear, check manually'`\n\nFrom these conditions, we can see that the message \"System failure imminent\" is returned only when:\n- The system status is 'bad', and\n- There are error logs.\n\nTherefore, the message 'System failure imminent' does indeed imply that there were error logs and the system status was 'bad'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

We need to determine if the message 'System failure imminent' implies both that there were error logs (`error_logs` is True) and the system status was 'bad' (`system_status` is 'bad').\n\n4.
