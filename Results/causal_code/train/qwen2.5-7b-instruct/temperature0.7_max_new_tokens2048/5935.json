  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Alice currently has a grade 'B', determined by her high attendance and moderate study hours. Increasing study hours without changing the high attendance (>90) will not improve the grade from 'B' to 'A' unless she increases her study hours above 5.",
  "causal_map": "study_hours → grade; attendance → grade",
  "causal_map_integration": "attendance and study_hours both directly influence the grade. Increasing study hours can improve the grade if attendance is above 90, and has a lesser impact if attendance is below 90.",
