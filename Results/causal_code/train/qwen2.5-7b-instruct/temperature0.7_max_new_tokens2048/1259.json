    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_prediction` calculates sales based on two factors: temperature and whether a promotion is active.\n2. We need to determine if an increase in sales from 120 to 150 indicates that a promotion was added.\n\nFirst, let's see what would cause the sales to be 120:\n- If `temperature <= 20` and there is no promotion (`promotion_active = False`), then `sales = base_sales = 100`.\n- If `temperature > 20` and there is no promotion, then `sales = base_sales + 20 = 120`.\n\nNow, let's see what would cause the sales to be 150:\n- If `temperature > 20` and there is a promotion, then `sales = base_sales + 50 = 150`.\n\nGiven these conditions, an increase from 120 to 150 could only happen if a promotion was added, because it's the only scenario that results in an increase from 120 (which occurs at `temperature > 20` without promotion) to 150.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `sales_prediction` function step by step:\n\n1. **Base Sales**: The base sales value is set to 100.\n\n2. **Temperature Check**:\n   - If the temperature is greater than 20:\n     - If a promotion is active, the sales increase by 50.\n     - If no promotion is active, the sales increase by 20.\n   - If the temperature is not greater than 20 (i.e., it is 20 or less):\n     - If a promotion is active, the sales increase by 30.\n     - If no promotion is active, the sales remain at the base value of 100.\n\n3. **Sales Increase Analysis**:\n   - From 120 to 150 represents an increase of 30 units.\n   - According to the function:\n     - If the temperature is greater than 20 and a promotion is active, the increase would be 50 units.\n     - If the temperature is greater than 20 and no promotion is active, the increase would be 20 units.\n     - If the temperature is 20 or less and a promotion is active, the increase would be 30 units.\n     - If the temperature is 20 or less and no promotion is active, the increase would be 0 units.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - An increase of 30 units in sales aligns with the scenario where the temperature is 20 or less and a promotion is active.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot conclusively determine that a promotion was added just based on the observed increase from 120 to 150 in sales. The increase could also occur due to the temperature being 20 or less without any promotion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the function**:\n   - The `sales_prediction` function takes two parameters: `temperature` and `promotion_active`.\n   - It calculates sales based on these inputs.\n\n2. **Analyze the conditions**:\n   - If `temperature > 20`:\n     - If `promotion_active` is True, sales = base_sales (100) + 50 = 150.\n     - If `promotion_active` is False, sales = base_sales (100) + 20 = 120.\n   - If `temperature <= 20`:\n     - If `promotion_active` is True, sales = base_sales (100) + 30 = 130.\n     - If `promotion_active` is False, sales = base_sales (100).\n\n3. **Given data**:\n   - We observe an increase in sales from 120 to 150.\n\n4. **Determine possible scenarios**:\n   - From 120 to 150:\n     - This could only happen if:\n       - The initial sales were 120 (when `temperature <= 20` and `promotion_active` is False).\n       - Then the sales increased to 150 (which means `promotion_active` became True while `temperature > 20`).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The increase from 120 to 150 sales can indeed be concluded as a result of adding a promotion when the temperature is above 20 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_prediction` takes two parameters: `temperature` and `promotion_active`.\n\n2. It calculates sales based on these parameters with specific conditions.\n\n3. We need to analyze the possible scenarios that could lead to an increase in sales from 120 to 150.\n\n4. The base sales are 100.\n\n5. Let's break down the conditions for the sales increase:\n\n   - If the temperature is greater than 20:\n     - With promotion active: Sales = 100 + 50 = 150\n     - Without promotion: Sales = 100 + 20 = 120\n\n   - If the temperature is not greater than 20 (i.e., ≤ 20):\n     - With promotion active: Sales = 100 + 30 = 130\n     - Without promotion: Sales = 100\n\n6. From the above conditions, we can see that an increase from 120 to 150 can only happen if:\n   - The initial sales were 120 (when the temperature is ≤ 20 and without promotion)\n   - And then the promotion was added (making the temperature condition irrelevant since it's already less than or equal to 20)\n\n7. This scenario directly indicates that a promotion was added.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to determine if an increase in sales from 120 to 150 indicates that a promotion was added.\n\n2. First, let's consider the conditions under which the sales prediction function would result in a sale of 120:\n   - The base sales is 100.\n   - For a sale to be 120, the temperature must be ≤ 20 AND the promotion must not be active.\n   - This is because in the \"else\" block (temperature ≤ 20), if promotion_active is False, sales = base_sales + 0.\n\n3. Next, let's consider the conditions for a sale of 150:\n   - The base sales is 100.\n   - For a sale to be 150, the temperature must be > 20 AND the promotion must be active.\n   - This is because in the \"if\" block (temperature > 20), if promotion_active is True, sales = base_sales + 50.\n\n4. Now, we need to check if an increase from 120 to 150 fits these conditions:\n   - An increase from 120 to 150 means the sales went up by 30.\n   - This matches the condition where the temperature is > 20 and the promotion is active, as it results in an increase of 50 from the base sales.\n\n5. However, we need to consider all possible scenarios:\n   - If the temperature was > 20 and the promotion was active, the sales would indeed increase to 150.\n   - But if the temperature was ≤ 20 and the promotion was not active, the sales would remain at 120.\n   - There's no other combination of temperature and promotion status that would result in an increase from 120 to 150.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that observing an increase in sales from 120 to 150 does indicate that a promotion was added, assuming the temperature was > 20.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
