    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `Patient` class has an attribute `blood_pressure` initialized to 120.\n2. The `update_blood_pressure` method increases blood pressure based on the `stress_level` parameter.\n3. The `apply_medication` method decreases blood pressure by a specified `reduce_factor`.\n\nNow, let's look at what happens in the `visit_doctor` function:\n\n1. It calls `patient.update_blood_pressure(stress_level)` which increases blood pressure.\n2. If the resulting blood pressure is greater than 140, it then calls `patient.apply_medication(20)`.\n\nThe key point here is that `apply_medication` is only called if the blood pressure exceeds 140 after updating for the stress level. When `apply_medication` is called, it reduces the blood pressure by 20.\n\nTherefore, if the condition for applying medication is met (i.e., blood pressure > 140), then yes, the blood pressure will indeed decrease as a result of applying the medication.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `Patient` class has a method `apply_medication` that takes a `reduce_factor` parameter.\n2.

In the `visit_doctor` function, there's an if condition that checks if the patient's blood pressure is greater than 140.\n4. If this condition is true, then `apply_medication` is called with a `reduce_factor` of 20.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude:\n\n- If the patient's blood pressure is greater than 140 after updating it based on the `stress_level`, the `apply_medication` method will be called.\n- When `apply_medication` is called, it directly reduces the blood pressure by the `reduce_factor` (which is 20 in this case).\n\nTherefore, if medication is applied, the blood pressure will indeed decrease.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
