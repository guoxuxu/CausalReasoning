    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `HealthSystem` object is initialized with an initial health of 100 and no immunity.\n2. **Apply Medication**: The `apply_medication` method is called with a dose of 60. Since the dose is greater than 50, two things happen:\n   - `has_immunity` is set to `True`.\n   - `health` increases by 20, making it 120.\n3. **Encounter Pathogen**: The `encounter_pathogen` method is then called. Since `has_immunity` is `True`, the condition `if not self.has_immunity:` is false, and no health reduction occurs.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the system encountered a pathogen because the health increased.\n\n- The health increased due to the application of medication (dose > 50).\n- However, the encounter with the pathogen did not occur because the condition for encountering a pathogen (`not self.has_immunity`) was not met.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - `initial_health` is set to 100.\n   - `has_immunity` is initially `False`.\n\n2. **Applying Medication**:\n   - The `apply_medication` method is called with a `medicine_dose` of 60.\n   - Since `medicine_dose` is greater than 50, the conditions `medicine_dose > 50 → has_immunity` and `medicine_dose > 50 → health += 20` are met.\n   - Therefore, `has_immunity` becomes `True`, and `health` increases by 20, making `health` equal to 120.\n\n3. **Encountering Pathogen**:\n   - The `encounter_pathogen` method is called.\n   - Since `has_immunity` is `True`, the condition `not has_immunity → health -= 30` does not apply.\n   - Therefore, no decrease in `health` occurs due to encountering the pathogen.\n\n4. **Question Analysis**:\n   - The question asks if the system encountered a pathogen because the health increased.\n   - From the given causal relationships, we see that the health increase (to 120) does not prevent the encounter of a pathogen.\n   - However, the health decrease (-30) only happens if there is no immunity (`not has_immunity`), which is not the case here since `has_immunity` is `True`.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the health increase did not prevent the system from encountering a pathogen.
