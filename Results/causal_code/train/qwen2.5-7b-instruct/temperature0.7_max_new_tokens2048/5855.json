    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `calculateUnvaccinatedInfections` method returns:\n   `population * infectionRate * (1 - vaccinationEffectiveness)`\n\n2. We need to consider how each variable affects this calculation:\n   - `population`: This is a fixed value for a given campaign.\n   - `infectionRate`: This is a multiplier that directly scales the number of infections.\n   - `vaccinationEffectiveness`: This reduces the number of infections by a factor.\n\n3. If the `infectionRate` increases:\n   - The term `infectionRate` in the formula will become larger.\n   - Since `infectionRate` is multiplied directly with other terms, an increase in `infectionRate` will lead to a proportional increase in the result of the formula.\n\n4. The terms `population` and `(1 - vaccinationEffectiveness)` remain constant unless their values change, which they don't in this scenario.\n\n5. Therefore, if the `infectionRate` increases, the overall product in the formula will also increase, leading to more unvaccinated infections being calculated.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Let's break down the components of this formula:\n   - Population: This is a fixed value for the given campaign.\n   - Infection Rate: This is a variable that can change.\n   - Vaccination Effectiveness: This is another variable that can change.\n\n3. The term `(1 - vaccinationEffectiveness)` represents the proportion of the population that is still susceptible to infection after accounting for the effectiveness of the vaccine.\n\n4. If the infection rate increases, the term `\\text{infectionRate}` in the formula will become larger.\n\n5. Since the other terms (`population` and `(1 - vaccinationEffectiveness)`) remain constant, an increase in the infection rate directly results in a higher product in the formula.\n\n6.

We need to consider how changes in the infection rate affect this calculation.\n\n3. If the infection rate (`infectionRate`) increases, it will directly multiply the result of the entire expression on the right-hand side of the equation.\n\n4. Since the formula is a product of three terms, an increase in the infection rate will cause the whole expression to increase, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n\n5. The `population` and `vaccinationEffectiveness` values do not change based on the question's context, so we can focus solely on the effect of the increased infection rate.\n\n6.
