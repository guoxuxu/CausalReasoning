    "Let's analyze the function `calculate_costs` step by step:\n\n1. The `total_cost` is initially calculated as `(quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost`.\n\n2. If `quantity > 50`, a 10% discount is applied to `total_cost`.\n\n3. We need to consider two cases:\n   - When `quantity <= 50`\n   - When `quantity > 50`\n\n4. For `quantity <= 50`:\n   - As `quantity` increases, both `quantity * base_cost` and `total_cost` will increase.\n   - Therefore, `total_cost` will increase with `quantity`.\n\n5. For `quantity > 50`:\n   - As `quantity` increases, `quantity * base_cost` will increase, but so will the `total_cost`.\n   - However, once the condition `quantity > 50` is met, a 10% discount is applied.\n   - The key point here is that the discount only reduces the `total_cost` if it exceeds a certain threshold, but it doesn't necessarily offset the increase in cost due to the increased quantity.\n\n6. To determine if `total_cost` will necessarily increase, we need to consider the impact of the discount. The discount is applied after the cost has already increased based on the quantity. Given that the cost of increasing `quantity` is substantial (it multiplies the `base_cost`), the discount (which is a fixed percentage) may not be enough to counteract this increase.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that while there might be some specific values of `quantity` where the total cost does not increase (due to the discount), generally speaking, an increase in `quantity` will lead to an increase in `total_cost` because the cost of the increased quantity will likely outweigh the discount.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"} because the increase in `quantity` does not necessarily result in a proportional increase in `total_cost` due to the application of the discount for large quantities.",
    "Let's analyze the function `calculate_costs` step by step to determine if 'total_cost' will necessarily increase as 'quantity' increases.\n\n1. **Initial Calculation**: The initial cost is calculated as `(quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost`. This means that as 'quantity' increases, the first part of the calculation (`quantity * base_cost`) will also increase, which would suggest an increase in 'total_cost'.\n\n2. **Discount Condition**: However, there is a condition where if `quantity > 50`, a 10% discount is applied. This means that for quantities greater than 50, the total cost can decrease even if the base cost increases.\n\n3. **Breaking Down the Scenarios**:\n   - For `quantity <= 50`: In this case, the only factor affecting the 'total_cost' is the sum of `quantity * base_cost` and `transport_cost`. As 'quantity' increases, 'total_cost' will increase.\n   - For `quantity > 50`: Here, the situation becomes more complex due to the discount. If the increase in `quantity` leads to a significant enough increase in the base cost, it might still result in a higher 'total_cost'. However, if the increase in quantity is not large enough to offset the 10% discount, the 'total_cost' could actually decrease.\n\nGiven these points, we cannot definitively say that 'total_cost' will necessarily increase with an increase in 'quantity' because the application of the 10% discount for quantities over 50 introduces a scenario where the cost might not increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the function `calculate_costs` step by step to determine if an increase in 'quantity' will necessarily lead to an increase in 'total_cost'.\n\n1. **Initial Calculation**: \n   - The initial cost is calculated as `(quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost`.\n   - This part of the calculation is directly proportional to 'quantity'. If 'quantity' increases, this part of the cost will also increase.\n\n2. **Discount Condition**:\n   - If `quantity > 50`, a 10% discount is applied.\n   - However, even with the discount, the total cost still depends on the base cost and transport cost.\n\n3. **Effect of Quantity Increase**:\n   - For quantities less than or equal to 50, the cost will increase proportionally with 'quantity'.\n   - For quantities greater than 50, the cost will still increase initially but then be reduced by the 10% discount. \n\n4. **Critical Analysis**:\n   - If the base cost per unit is high enough, the increase in the initial cost (before discount) might outweigh the 10% reduction for larger quantities.\n   - Conversely, if the base cost per unit is low, the discount might make the cost decrease even when 'quantity' increases beyond 50.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that an increase in 'quantity' does not necessarily result in an increase in 'total_cost'. There are scenarios where increasing 'quantity' could lead to a decrease in 'total_cost' due to the discount applied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function calculates the total cost based on the quantity, base cost, and transport cost.\n\n2. The initial calculation for total cost is:\n   `total_cost = (quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost`\n\n3. If the quantity exceeds 50, there's an additional 10% discount applied:\n   `discount = 0.1`\n   `total_cost = total_cost - (total_cost * discount)`\n\n4. Let's consider different scenarios:\n   - If the quantity is 50 or less, the total cost will be:\n     `total_cost = (quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost`\n   - If the quantity is more than 50, the total cost becomes:\n     `total_cost = ((quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost) - 0.1 * ((quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost)`\n\n5. For quantities up to 50, increasing the quantity will directly increase the total cost because we're adding more of the base cost.\n\n6. However, once the quantity exceeds 50, while the base cost continues to add, the discount also reduces the total cost proportionally.\n\n7. The key point is that the discount starts to apply after 50 units, which means that for very large quantities, the additional cost per unit might not significantly increase due to the discount.\n\n8. Therefore, while generally increasing quantity will increase total cost, it's not guaranteed that the total cost will always increase as the quantity goes up, especially when the discount starts to apply.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze the function `calculate_costs` step by step to determine if an increase in 'quantity' will necessarily lead to an increase in 'total_cost'.\n\n1. **Base Cost Calculation**: The initial cost calculation is `total_cost = (quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost`. Here, the `base_cost` is directly proportional to the `quantity`, so increasing `quantity` will increase this part of the cost.\n\n2. **Discount Condition**: If `quantity > 50`, there is a 10% discount applied to the total cost. This means that for quantities greater than 50, the `total_cost` will be reduced by 10%.\n\n3. **Discount Impact**:\n   - For `quantity <= 50`, the cost will simply be `total_cost = (quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost`.\n   - For `quantity > 50`, the cost will be reduced by 10% after the initial calculation.\n\nNow, let's consider different scenarios:\n\n- **When `quantity <= 50`**: In this case, as `quantity` increases, the `total_cost` will increase because the base cost component is directly proportional to `quantity`.\n\n- **When `quantity > 50`**: Here, even though the base cost component still increases with `quantity`, the overall `total_cost` might not necessarily increase due to the 10% discount. Specifically:\n  - If the increase in `base_cost * quantity` is less than 10% of the total cost, the discount could reduce the `total_cost`.\n  - For example, if `base_cost` is very low, increasing `quantity` might not be enough to offset the 10% discount, potentially leading to a decrease in `total_cost`.\n\nTherefore, based on the logic provided in the function, an increase in `quantity` does not necessarily result in an increase in `total_cost`, especially when `quantity` is above 50.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"

To determine if the total cost necessarily increases with `quantity`, we need to consider the point where the discount kicks in:\n   - For `quantity <= 50`, the total cost will increase with `quantity` since there's no discount.\n   - For `quantity > 50`, the total cost might not necessarily increase because of the discount.\n\n6.

Now consider the scenario where `quantity` increases to 51 or more:\n   - The total cost calculation includes a 10% discount when `quantity` exceeds 50.\n   - The discount reduces the total cost, so even though the base cost term increases, the overall total cost might not necessarily increase.\n\n5.
