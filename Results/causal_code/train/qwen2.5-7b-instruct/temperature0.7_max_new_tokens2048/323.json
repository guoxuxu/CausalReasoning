  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",

  "Explanation": "Adding a 'multiply' operation after 'add(5)' would change the intermediate state from 15 to 30 (15 * 2), and following 'subtract(3)', the final output would then be 27 instead of 12. Therefore, intervening by adding a multiplication operation significantly affects the outcome due to the compound effect on the subsequent subtraction.",
