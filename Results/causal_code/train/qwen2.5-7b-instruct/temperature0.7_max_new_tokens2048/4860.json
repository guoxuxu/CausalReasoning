    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `prescribe_medication` has conditions that determine which medication to prescribe based on age and heart rate.\n\n2. For 'Beta Blocker' to be prescribed, the following condition must be met:\n   - `age > 50` (this is a requirement for prescribing any medication)\n   - AND `heart_rate > 100`\n\n3. If both of these conditions are true, then 'Beta Blocker' will be returned by the function.\n\n4. We need to check if we can conclude that the patient's age is over 50 and their heart rate was greater than 100 when 'Beta Blocker' is prescribed.\n\n5. From the code provided, we see that if the first condition (`age > 50`) is met and the second condition (`heart_rate > 100`) is also met, 'Beta Blocker' is prescribed.\n\n6. Therefore, if 'Beta Blocker' is prescribed, it directly implies that both conditions were met:\n   - The patient's age is over 50.\n   - The patient's heart rate was greater than 100.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `prescribe_medication` checks several conditions to determine which medication to prescribe.\n\n2. For 'Beta Blocker' to be prescribed, the following condition must be met:\n   - `age > 50` AND `heart_rate > 100`\n\n3. If any other condition is met, 'Beta Blocker' will not be prescribed:\n   - `age > 50` AND `heart_rate <= 100`\n   - `age <= 50` AND (other conditions that don't involve heart rate)\n\n4. Therefore, if 'Beta Blocker' is prescribed, it means both conditions for prescribing 'Beta Blocker' were true:\n   - The patient's age is over 50.\n   - The patient's heart rate is greater than 100.\n\n5. There are no other scenarios where 'Beta Blocker' could be prescribed that would allow us to conclude these specific conditions.\n\nBased on this reasoning, if 'Beta Blocker' is prescribed, we can indeed conclude that the patient's age is over 50 and their heart rate was greater than 100.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `prescribe_medication` has multiple conditions to determine which medication to prescribe.\n2.

If both these conditions are true, then 'Beta Blocker' is returned.\n\n4. The question asks if we can conclude that both of these conditions were met when 'Beta Blocker' was prescribed.\n\n5. Given that the function directly returns 'Beta Blocker' only when both conditions are satisfied, it means that if 'Beta Blocker' is prescribed, we can indeed conclude that both conditions were met.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
