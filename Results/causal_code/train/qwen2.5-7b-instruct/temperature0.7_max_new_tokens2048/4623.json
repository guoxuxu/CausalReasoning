    "Let's break down the logic of the code step by step:\n\n1. We have an object `system` instantiated with a traffic level of 30.\n2. The `updateTrafficLevel` method is called with a new traffic level of 90.\n3. Inside the `updateTrafficLevel` method:\n   - The traffic level is updated to 90.\n   - The `updateDelay` method is called.\n\n4. In the `updateDelay` method, there are three conditions based on the traffic level:\n   - If `this.trafficLevel >= 80`, then `this.delay` is set to 'High'.\n   - If `this.trafficLevel >= 50` and not already >= 80, then `this.delay` is set to 'Moderate'.\n   - Otherwise, `this.delay` is set to 'Low'.\n\nGiven that the traffic level is now 90, let's check the conditions:\n- Since 90 is greater than or equal to 80, the first condition (`if(this.trafficLevel >= 80)`) is true.\n- Therefore, `this.delay` will be set to 'High'.\n\nSo, if the traffic level is set to 90, the delay will indeed be set to 'High' without any intervention.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. We have a `VehicleSystem` class with a constructor that initializes the `trafficLevel`.\n2. The `updateTrafficLevel` method updates the `trafficLevel` and calls `updateDelay()`.\n3. The `updateDelay` method checks the `trafficLevel` and sets the `delay` property based on the following conditions:\n   - If `trafficLevel` is >= 80, `delay` is set to 'High'.\n   - If `trafficLevel` is >= 50 but < 80, `delay` is set to 'Moderate'.\n   - Otherwise, `delay` is set to 'Low'.\n\nGiven the code:\n```javascript\nconst system = new VehicleSystem(30); // Initial traffic level is 30\nsystem.updateTrafficLevel(90);        // Update traffic level to 90\n```\n\n4. When `system.updateTrafficLevel(90)` is called, it updates the `trafficLevel` to 90 and then calls `updateDelay()`.\n5. In `updateDelay()`, since the `trafficLevel` is 90 (which is >= 80), the `delay` will be set to 'High'.\n\nTherefore, if the traffic level is set to 90, the delay will indeed be high without any further intervention.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
