    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `add_item` method is defined in the `ShoppingCart` class.\n2. This method takes one parameter, `item_price`.\n3. Inside the method, there's a condition that checks if `item_price > 0`. If this condition is true, it proceeds to add the `item_price` to both `self.items` and `self.total`.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that:\n\n- For the `add_item` method to execute its primary logic (adding the price to `items` and `total`), the `item_price` must be greater than 0.\n- When an item with a positive price is added using `add_item`, it directly increases the value of `self.total` by the amount of `item_price`.\n\nTherefore, if the `add_item` method is used, the `total` will indeed increase as long as the `item_price` is a positive number.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `add_item` method is defined in the `ShoppingCart` class.\n2. It takes one parameter: `item_price`.\n3.

Both actions directly affect the `total` attribute of the ShoppingCart instance.\n5. The condition `if item_price > 0:` ensures that only positive prices are added, which makes logical sense for a shopping cart.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that whenever the `add_item` method is called with a valid (positive) price, the `total` attribute of the ShoppingCart instance will indeed increase by that price.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
