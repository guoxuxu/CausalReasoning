    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `initializeSystem` method sets `systemReady` to true and initializes `taskCount` to 5.\n2. The `addTasks` method increments `taskCount` only if `systemReady` is true.\n3. We are asked what happens if we manually set the system to ready and then add tasks.\n\nNow let's consider the scenario:\n- Suppose we call `initializeSystem()` first, which sets `systemReady` to true and `taskCount` to 5.\n- Then, if we manually set `systemReady` to true (let's say using `systemReady = true;`), `systemReady` is now true.\n- Now, if we call `addTasks(newTasks)`, it will check the condition `systemReady ? newTasks : 0`.\n- Since `systemReady` is true, it will add `newTasks` to `taskCount`.\n\nTherefore, if the system is manually set to ready, adding tasks will indeed change the task count.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
