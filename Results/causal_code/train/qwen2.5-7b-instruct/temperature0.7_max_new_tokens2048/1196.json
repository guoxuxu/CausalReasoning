    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a list of integers as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list `result`.\n3. For each `datum` in the input list:\n   - It multiplies the `datum` by 2.\n   - If the result is greater than 10, it appends the result to `result`.\n\n4. We need to determine if the output list `result` will be non-empty when the input list contains only integers greater than 5.\n\n5. Let's consider the smallest possible integer in the input list that is greater than 5. That would be 6.\n\n6. For 6:\n   - 6 * 2 = 12\n   - 12 > 10, so 12 would be appended to the `result` list.\n\n7. Since the smallest possible value (6) in the input list, when doubled, results in a number greater than 10, it will always be appended to the `result` list.\n\n8. Therefore, as long as there is at least one integer greater than 5 in the input list, the `result` list will not be empty.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a list of integers as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list `result`.\n3. It iterates over each element in the input list `data`.\n4. For each element `datum`, it computes `computed = datum * 2`.\n5. If `computed > 10`, it appends `computed` to the `result` list.\n6. The function returns the `result` list.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition that all elements in the input list are integers greater than 5:\n\n7. If `datum > 5`, then `computed = datum * 2` will always be greater than 10 because:\n   - The smallest possible value for `datum` is 6 (since it must be greater than 5).\n   - Therefore, `computed = 6 * 2 = 12`, which is indeed greater than 10.\n\n8. Since `computed` will always be greater than 10 when `datum` is greater than 5, every element in the input list will satisfy the condition `computed > 10`.\n\n9. As a result, every element in the input list will be appended to the `result` list.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that if the input data list contains only integers greater than 5, the output list `result` will always be non-empty.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
