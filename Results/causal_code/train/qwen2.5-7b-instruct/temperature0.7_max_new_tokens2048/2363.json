    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the `Server` class**:\n   - The `requestsHandled` property starts at 0.\n   - The `handleRequest` method increments `requestsHandled` by 1 each time it's called.\n   - If `requestsHandled` exceeds 50, the `serverLoad` is set to 'High'.\n\n2. **Understanding the `simulateActivity` function**:\n   - This function runs a loop 60 times.\n   - In each iteration, it calls `handleRequest` on the server with a 'NewRequest' parameter.\n   - Every 5th iteration (i.e., when `i % 5 == 0`), it calls `openConnection` on the database.\n\n3. **Determining when `serverLoad` becomes 'High'**:\n   - Since `handleRequest` is called 60 times, we need to check how many times it will increment `requestsHandled` to exceed 50.\n   - The first 50 calls will not change `serverLoad`.\n   - The 51st call will set `serverLoad` to 'High'.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Yes, if `serverLoad` is 'High', it implies that more than 50 requests were handled because the condition to set `serverLoad` to 'High' is exactly when `requestsHandled` exceeds 50.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `server` and `database` objects are initialized with `requestsHandled` and `connections` set to 0, and `serverLoad` and `dataLoad` set to 'Low'.\n\n2. **handleRequest Method**:\n   - This method increments `requestsHandled` by 1.\n   - If `requestsHandled` exceeds 50, it sets `serverLoad` to 'High'.\n\n3. **simulateActivity Function**:\n   - This function runs a loop 60 times.\n   - In each iteration, it calls `handleRequest` on the `server` object.\n   - Every 5th iteration (i.e., when `i % 5 == 0`), it calls `openConnection` on the `database` object.\n\n4. **Causal Relationship Analysis**:\n   - The condition `requestsHandled > 50` directly causes `serverLoad` to be set to 'High'.\n   - Therefore, if `serverLoad` is 'High', it must be true that `requestsHandled > 50`.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that if `serverLoad` is 'High', then more than 50 requests have indeed been handled.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have a `Server` class with a method `handleRequest` that increments the `requestsHandled` counter each time it's called.\n\n2. If `requestsHandled` exceeds 50, the `serverLoad` is set to 'High'.\n\n3. The `simulateActivity` function runs a loop 60 times:\n   - In each iteration, it calls `handleRequest` on the server.\n   - Every 5th iteration, it also calls `openConnection` on the database.\n\n4.
