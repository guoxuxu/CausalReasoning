    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `shouldWearJacket` method returns true under two conditions:\n   - If `isRaining` is true.\n   - If `temperature` is less than 15.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can be certain it's raining when `shouldWearJacket` returns true.\n\n3. Let's consider the two conditions separately:\n   - Condition 1 (`isRaining`): If `isRaining` is true, then `shouldWearJacket` returns true, and we know it's raining.\n   - Condition 2 (`temperature < 15`): If the temperature is less than 15, `shouldWearJacket` still returns true, but we cannot be certain that it's raining based solely on this condition. It could be cold but not raining.\n\n4. Therefore, while `isRaining` being true guarantees that `shouldWearJacket` returns true, the reverse is not necessarily true. There are cases where `shouldWearJacket` returns true without it being raining.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot be certain that it's raining just because `shouldWearJacket` returns true.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",

We need to determine if the method returning true guarantees that it is raining.\n\n3. Consider the following scenarios where `shouldWearJacket` returns true:\n   - It is raining, regardless of the temperature.\n   - It is not raining but the temperature is below 15 degrees.\n\n4. In the second scenario (temperature < 15), the method returns true without needing it to be raining.\n\n5.

    "Let's analyze the `shouldWearJacket` method step by step:\n\n1.

To determine if we can be certain that it's raining (`isRaining` is `true`) when `shouldWearJacket` returns `true`, we need to consider all possible scenarios where `shouldWearJacket` returns `true`.\n\n3.
