The `analyze_data` method only operates on the `normalized_data` that is produced by the `process_data` method.\n\n4. Changing the `filter_threshold` will directly affect which elements are included in the `filtered_data`, and consequently, which values are present in the `normalized_data`.\n\n5.

    "To determine whether altering the `filter_threshold` parameter affects the `normalized_data` output, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Filtering Data**: The `process_data` method filters out elements from `data` where the value is less than or equal to `filter_threshold`.
