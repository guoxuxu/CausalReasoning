  "Explanation": "Since tasks can only be added (and thus increase the task count) when the system is ready, a non-zero task count implies that the system must have been initialized (`systemReady` set to true) at some point. The reset system sets `systemReady` to false and task count to zero, so a non-zero task count implies initialization.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `initializeSystem` method sets `systemReady` to true and sets `taskCount` to 5.\n2. The `addTasks` method only increases `taskCount` if `systemReady` is true (i.e., the system has been initialized).\n3. The `resetSystem` method sets both `systemReady` and `taskCount` back to false and 0, respectively.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenarios where `taskCount` could be non-zero:\n\n- If the system has been initialized (`initializeSystem` called), `taskCount` will be set to 5.\n- If tasks are added after initialization, `taskCount` can increase from 5.\n- If the system is reset (`resetSystem` called), `taskCount` will be set back to 0.\n\nGiven these points, we need to determine if a non-zero `taskCount` always indicates that the system has been initialized:\n\n- A non-zero `taskCount` could have resulted from:\n  - The system being initialized and then having tasks added.\n  - Tasks being added directly without initial system initialization (which is not allowed by the current logic as `addTasks` requires `systemReady` to be true).\n\nHowever, the key point is that a non-zero `taskCount` does not necessarily mean the system was initialized. It could be due to tasks being added after a reset, which would still result in a non-zero `taskCount` even though the system wasn't \"fully\" initialized (meaning `systemReady` is false).\n\nTherefore, a non-zero task count does not always indicate that the system has been initialized.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `taskCount` variable is initially set to 0 in the class definition.\n2. The `initializeSystem()` method sets `systemReady` to true and `taskCount` to 5.\n3. The `addTasks(int newTasks)` method only increments `taskCount` if `systemReady` is true. Otherwise, it does nothing.\n4. The `resetSystem()` method sets both `systemReady` and `taskCount` back to their initial values (false and 0 respectively).\n\nGiven these points:\n- If the system is initialized using `initializeSystem()`, `taskCount` will be set to 5.\n- If the system is not initialized, `taskCount` will remain at 0.\n- `addTasks()` can only increase `taskCount` if the system is already initialized, but it cannot make `taskCount` go below 0.\n\nTherefore, a non-zero task count can only occur if the system has been initialized and no `resetSystem()` calls have been made since initialization.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
