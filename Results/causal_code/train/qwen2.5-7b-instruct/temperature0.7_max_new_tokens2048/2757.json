    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_forecast` takes two parameters: `hours_worked` and `ad_budget`.\n2. It calculates `productivity` as `hours_worked * 0.5`.\n3. It calculates `ad_effectiveness` as `ad_budget * 0.3`.\n4. It then computes `total_sales` as `(productivity + ad_effectiveness) * 1000`.\n\nNow, let's consider whether we can uniquely determine `hours_worked` given `total_sales` and a fixed `ad_budget`.\n\n5. If we fix the `ad_budget`, the term `ad_effectiveness` becomes a constant value.\n6. The formula for `total_sales` simplifies to: `total_sales = (hours_worked * 0.5 + ad_effectiveness) * 1000`.\n7. Rearranging for `hours_worked`, we get: `hours_worked = (total_sales / 1000 - ad_effectiveness) / 0.5`.\n8. Since `ad_effectiveness` is a fixed value when the `ad_budget` is fixed, the equation provides a unique solution for `hours_worked` for any given `total_sales`.\n\nTherefore, with a fixed advertising budget, knowing the total sales allows us to calculate the exact number of hours worked.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_forecast` takes two inputs: `hours_worked` and `ad_budget`.\n\n2.
