  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "In the original code, the air quality index is set higher when the factory is operational (150 or 200 depending on initial status or update status, respectively) compared to when it is not operational (50 or 40 respectively). Thus, switching the factory from operational to non-operational will lower the air quality index.",
