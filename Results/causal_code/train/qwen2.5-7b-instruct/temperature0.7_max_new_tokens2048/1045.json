    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data(data)` checks if the key 'age' exists in the input dictionary `data`.\n2. If 'age' exists, it sets `data['is_adult']` to `True` only if `data['age'] >= 18`.\n3. The second condition checks if both 'income' and 'is_adult' exist and are `True`.\n4. If these conditions are met, it sets `data['tax_bracket']`.\n\nThe key point here is understanding what triggers `data['is_adult']` to be set to `True`. According to the code, `data['is_adult']` is set to `True` if and only if `data['age'] >= 18`.\n\nTherefore, if `data['is_adult']` is `True`, we can indeed infer that `data['age'] >= 18` because that is the exact condition under which `data['is_adult']` is set to `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

If 'age' exists, it sets `data['is_adult']` to `True` only if the value of 'age' is greater than or equal to 18.\n3. Later in the function, it checks if both 'income' and 'is_adult' keys exist and if `is_adult` is `True`.\n4. The setting of `is_adult` is done based on the condition `data['age'] >= 18`.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that if `data['is_adult']` is set to `True`, it must be because the corresponding value for 'age' was indeed greater than or equal to 18.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. It first checks if the key 'age' exists in the dictionary.\n3. If 'age' exists, it sets `data['is_adult']` to `True` if `data['age']` is greater than or equal to 18.\n4. Then, it checks if both 'income' exists and 'is_adult' is `True`.\n5. If these conditions are met, it sets `data['tax_bracket']` based on the value of 'income'.\n\nNow, focusing on the question: \"If the 'is_adult' key is set to true, can we infer that the 'age' key was greater than or equal to 18?\"\n\n- For 'is_adult' to be set to `True`, the condition `data['age'] >= 18` must be `True` when the 'age' key is present.\n- If 'is_adult' is set to `True`, it directly implies that `data['age']` was indeed greater than or equal to 18 at the time of setting 'is_adult'.\n\nTherefore, if 'is_adult' is set to `True`, we can indeed infer that the 'age' key was greater than or equal to 18.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The function then checks if both 'income' and 'is_adult' keys exist in the input `data`, and if 'is_adult' is `True`.\n4. Based on these conditions, it sets the 'tax_bracket' key to either 'high' or 'low'.\n\nNow, focusing on the question: Can we infer that the 'is_adult' key being set to `True` means that the 'age' key was greater than or equal to 18?\n\n- The condition for setting 'is_adult' to `True` is explicitly defined as `data['age'] >= 18`.\n- This means that whenever 'is_adult' is set to `True`, it is guaranteed that the corresponding 'age' value in the input `data` is indeed greater than or equal to 18.\n\nTherefore, if 'is_adult' is set to `True`, we can definitively infer that the 'age' key was greater than or equal to 18.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The logic for setting 'is_adult' is straightforward: \n   - If 'age' is present and >= 18, then 'is_adult' is set to True.\n   - Otherwise, 'is_adult' remains undefined (or could be False, depending on how the function is called).\n4. The question asks if 'is_adult' being set to True means we can infer that 'age' was >= 18.\n5.
