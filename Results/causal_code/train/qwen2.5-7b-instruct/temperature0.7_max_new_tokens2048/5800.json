    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ClimateController` class is initialized with an initial temperature of 22 degrees and humidity of 40%.\n\n2. The method `adjust_temperature` is called with an adjustment of +5 degrees.\n\n3. This increases the temperature from 22 to 27 degrees.\n\n4. Since the new temperature (27 degrees) is greater than 25 degrees, the condition `if self.temperature > 25:` is met.\n\n5. When this condition is met, the `activate_cooling_system()` method is called.\n\n6. In the `activate_cooling_system()` method, the humidity is decreased by 5%, making it 35%.\n\n7. The method then checks if the humidity is less than 30%. Since it is not (it's 35%), the humidifier is not activated.\n\n8. The cooling system is indeed activated because the temperature exceeded 25 degrees after the adjustment.\n\nGiven that the temperature was increased to 27 degrees, which is above 25 degrees, and the cooling system was activated as a result, we can conclude that the temperature was initially above 25 degrees when the cooling system was active.\n\nHowever, the temperature was not actually above 25 degrees initially; it was 22 degrees.
