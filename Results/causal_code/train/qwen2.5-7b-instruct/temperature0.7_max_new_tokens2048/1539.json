  "Explanation": "Since 'SAVE20' provides a 20% discount, the final price will not be doubled. It will be $160 after discount when the price is $200, which is not twice the final price of $80 when the price is $100.",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original price of the item is $100.\n2. A coupon code 'SAVE20' is applied, which gives a 20% discount.\n3. The discount calculation:\n   - 20% of $100 = 0.2 * 100 = $20\n4. The final price after applying the discount:\n   - Final price = Original price - Discount\n   - Final price = $100 - $20 = $80\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the price is increased to $200 and the same 'SAVE20' coupon is applied:\n\n1. The new original price of the item is $200.\n2. The same coupon code 'SAVE20' is applied, which still gives a 20% discount.\n3. The discount calculation remains the same:\n   - 20% of $200 = 0.2 * 200 = $40\n4. The final price after applying the discount:\n   - Final price = Original price - Discount\n   - Final price = $200 - $40 = $160\n\nWe can see that the final price does not double when the original price doubles. The original final price was $80, and now it is $160, which is not a doubling of the original final price.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the item is $100.\n2. **Coupon Code**: The coupon code used is 'SAVE20'.\n3. **Discount Calculation**:\n   - According to the function `calculate_discount`, when the coupon code is 'SAVE20', the discount applied is 20% (or 0.2).\n4. **Final Price Calculation**:\n   - The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n   - Substituting the values, we get `200 * (1 - 0.2) = 200 * 0.8 = 160`.\n\nSo, with the coupon code 'SAVE20', the final price of the item would be $160.\n\nNow, let's compare this with doubling the original price:\n- Doubling the original price ($100) would result in $200 * 2 = $200.\n\nClearly, the final price ($160) after applying the 'SAVE20' coupon code is not equal to double the original price ($200).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial price of the item is $100.\n2. With the 'SAVE20' coupon code, the function calculates a 20% discount.\n3. The calculation for the final price with the 'SAVE20' coupon would be:\n   \\[ \\text{final\\_price} = \\text{price} \\times (1 - \\text{discount}) \\]\n   \\[ \\text{final\\_price} = 100 \\times (1 - 0.2) \\]\n   \\[ \\text{final\\_price} = 100 \\times 0.8 \\]\n   \\[ \\text{final\\_price} = 80 \\]\n\n4. Now, let's consider the new price of $200 with the same 'SAVE20' coupon code:\n   \\[ \\text{final\\_price} = 200 \\times (1 - 0.2) \\]\n   \\[ \\text{final\\_price} = 200 \\times 0.8 \\]\n   \\[ \\text{final\\_price} = 160 \\]\n\n5. We can see that when the original price was doubled to $200, the final price after applying the 'SAVE20' coupon is not doubled; it becomes $160 instead of $400.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original price of the item is $100.\n2. With the 'SAVE20' coupon code, a 20% discount is applied.\n3. The calculation for the final price would be:\n   - Discount amount: 100 * 0.2 = $20\n   - Final price after discount: 100 - 20 = $80\n\n4. Now, the price of the item is increased to $200.\n5. We need to apply the same 'SAVE20' coupon code to this new price.\n6. The calculation for the final price at $200 would be:\n   - Discount amount: 200 * 0.2 = $40\n   - Final price after discount: 200 - 40 = $160\n\n7. Comparing the final prices:\n   - Original price increase: $80\n   - New price after applying the same discount: $160\n\n8. Doubling the original final price ($80) would result in $160.\n\nTherefore, the final price does indeed become double when the original price is doubled and the same 'SAVE20' coupon code is applied.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Price**: The initial price of the item is $100.\n2. **Coupon Code**: The coupon code used is 'SAVE20'.\n3. **Discount Calculation**:\n   - According to the function, if the coupon code is 'SAVE20', the discount applied is 0.2 (20%).\n4. **Final Price Calculation**:\n   - The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n   - For 'SAVE20', this becomes `200 * (1 - 0.2) = 200 * 0.8 = 160`.\n\nNow, let's compare the final price with the doubled initial price:\n\n- **Doubled Initial Price**: If the initial price was $100, doubling it would result in $200.\n- **Actual Final Price**: With the 'SAVE20' coupon, the final price is $160.\n\nSince $160 (final price) is not equal to $200 (doubled initial price), the final price is not doubled.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
