  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Since `updateDiet('healthy')` sets `hasHealthyDiet` to true and automatically calls `updateHealthStatus()`, the health status could improve based on the previous value of `exercisesRegularly`. The improvement is direct and doesn't require any external method calls beyond the diet update.",
  "causal_map": "hasHealthyDiet → healthStatus; exercisesRegularly → healthStatus",
  "causal_map_integration": "Calling `updateDiet('healthy')` will make `hasHealthyDiet` true, which, along with possibly `exercisesRegularly`, can improve `healthStatus` to 'excellent' or 'good'.",
