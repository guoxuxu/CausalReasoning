    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Thermostat` class has two main temperature variables:\n   - `desiredTemperature`: The temperature set by the user.\n   - `externalTemperature`: The current temperature outside.\n\n2. The system (heating/cooling) is controlled by the `systemOn` variable:\n   - If `systemOn` is `true`, the system is on.\n   - If `systemOn` is `false`, the system is off.\n\n3. The `adjustSystem()` method is called whenever the `externalTemperature` changes (`updateExternalTemp()`).\n\n4. The logic in `adjustSystem()` is as follows:\n   - If `externalTemperature` is less than `desiredTemperature` and the system is not already on, it turns the system on.\n   - If `externalTemperature` is greater than `desiredTemperature` and the system is currently on, it turns the system off.\n\n5. We observe that the system was turned off after an intervention (change in `externalTemperature`).\n\n6. For the system to be turned off, the only condition that would trigger this is:\n   - The `externalTemperature` must have been greater than the `desiredTemperature` while the system was already on.\n\n7. Therefore, for the system to turn off, the `externalTemperature` must have exceeded the `desiredTemperature`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

We are observing that the system was turned off (`systemOn = false`).\n\n5. For the system to turn off, the second condition must have been met:\n   - `externalTemperature > desiredTemperature` (the external temperature exceeded the desired temperature).\n   - And `systemOn` must have been true before the change, which implies `externalTemperature < desiredTemperature` before the change.\n\n6.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `adjustSystem()` method is called whenever `updateExternalTemp` is invoked.\n\n2.

However, the question only tells us that the system was turned off, not whether it was on before being turned off.\n\n6. There could be other scenarios where the system might be turned off without the external temperature exceeding the desired temperature:\n   - The system could have been turned off due to `externalTemperature < desiredTemperature` if the system was already on.\n\nGiven these points, we cannot conclusively say that the externalTemperature exceeded the desiredTemperature just because the system was turned off. \n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
