  "Explanation": "In the given code, if the marketing campaign is not active, the revenue would not increase by 20%. Hence, the profit calculated as `revenue - costs` would decrease compared to the scenario where the campaign is active. The profit is directly affected by the terms in the calculation which here is influenced by the revenue increase due to the marketing campaign.",

    "Let's break down the logic of the `business_logic` function step by step:\n\n1. The profit is initially calculated as `profit = revenue - costs`.\n2. If the `marketing_campaign_active` flag is `True`, then:\n   - A revenue increase of `revenue * 0.2` is added to the original revenue.\n   - This increased revenue is then used to recalculate the profit.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the marketing campaign is not active (`marketing_campaign_active = False`):\n\n1. The profit is still initially calculated as `profit = revenue - costs`.\n2. Since `marketing_campaign_active` is `False`, the line that increases revenue does not execute.\n3. Therefore, the profit remains unchanged from the initial calculation.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if the marketing campaign were not active, the profit would indeed remain the same.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `business_logic` calculates profit as `revenue - costs`.\n2. If `marketing_campaign_active` is `True`, it increases `revenue` by 20%.\n3. We need to compare the profit when the campaign is active vs. when it is not.\n\n### When Marketing Campaign is Active (Given Conditions)\n- Initial revenue = 10000\n- Initial costs = 7000\n- Marketing campaign is active (`True`)\n\nThe function will increase revenue by 20%:\n\\[ \\text{Revenue increase} = 10000 \\times 0.2 = 2000 \\]\nSo, new revenue becomes:\n\\[ 10000 + 2000 = 12000 \\]\n\nThen, the profit calculation:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 12000 - 7000 = 5000 \\]\n\n### When Marketing Campaign is Not Active\n- Initial revenue = 10000\n- Initial costs = 7000\n- Marketing campaign is not active (`False`)\n\nSince the campaign is not active, there is no increase in revenue:\n\\[ \\text{Profit} = 10000 - 7000 = 3000 \\]\n\n### Comparison\n- Profit with campaign active: 5000\n- Profit without campaign: 3000\n\nClearly, the profit is not the same when the marketing campaign is not active.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `business_logic` calculates profit as `revenue - costs`.\n\n2. If `marketing_campaign_active` is `True`, it increases revenue by 20% (`revenue * 0.2`).\n\n3. In the given scenario, `marketing_campaign_active` is `True`, so the revenue is increased by 20%.\n\n4. Let's calculate the profit when the campaign is active:\n   - Initial revenue = 10000\n   - Revenue increase = 10000 * 0.2 = 2000\n   - New revenue = 10000 + 2000 = 12000\n   - Costs = 7000\n   - Profit with campaign = 12000 - 7000 = 5000\n\n5. Now, let's consider the scenario where the marketing campaign is not active:\n   - Revenue remains at the initial value of 10000\n   - Costs remain at 7000\n   - Profit without campaign = 10000 - 7000 = 3000\n\n6. Comparing the two scenarios:\n   - With campaign: Profit = 5000\n   - Without campaign: Profit = 3000\n\nSince the profit is different when the campaign is active versus when it is not, we can conclude that the profit would not remain the same.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
