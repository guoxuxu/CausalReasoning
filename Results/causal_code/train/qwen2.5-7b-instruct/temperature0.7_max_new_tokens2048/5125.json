    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_metrics` calculates two main metrics:\n   - Total sales\n   - Average price\n\n2. Total sales is calculated as:\n   ```\n   sales = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in data)\n   ```\n\n3.

Therefore, the sum of these values will also be zero, because adding zero multiple times still results in zero.\n\n5. Let's verify this with the given example data where all prices are set to zero:\n   ```python\n   inventory = [\n       {'product': 'apple', 'price': 0, 'quantity': 30},\n       {'product': 'banana', 'price': 0, 'quantity': 50},\n       {'product': 'cherry', 'price': 0, 'quantity': 20}\n   ]\n   result = compute_metrics(inventory)\n   ```\n\n6. Running the above code would yield:\n   - `sales = 0 * 30 + 0 * 50 + 0 * 20 = 0`\n   - `num_items = 30 + 50 + 20 = 100`\n   - `average_price = 0 / 100 = 0`\n\n7. The result dictionary would be:\n   ```\n   {'total_sales': 0, 'average_price': 0}\n   ```\n\nBased on this reasoning, if all product prices are set to zero, the total_sales will indeed be zero.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
