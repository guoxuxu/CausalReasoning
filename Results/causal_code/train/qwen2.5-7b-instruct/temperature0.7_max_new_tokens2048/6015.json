    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Weather Change**: If the weather changes from 'sunny' to 'rainy'.\n2. **Calculate New Traffic Density**: \n   - For 'rainy' weather, the traffic density is calculated to be between 70 and 100.\n3. **Deploy New Traffic Signal**:\n   - The function `deploy_traffic_lights` checks if the density is greater than 60.\n   - Since the new density (between 70-100) is always greater than 60, the signal will be set to 'red'.\n4. **Apply Emergency Brakes**:\n   - The function `apply_emergency_brakes` checks if the signal is 'red'.\n   - If the signal is 'red', emergency brakes are applied.\n\nGiven this sequence of events, if the weather changes from 'sunny' to 'rainy', the traffic density increases significantly, leading to the traffic light being changed to 'red'.

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - If the weather is 'sunny', the traffic density will be between 20 and 50.\n   - With this lower density, the traffic light will most likely be 'green'.\n\n2. **Change in Weather**:\n   - When the weather changes from 'sunny' to 'rainy', the traffic density will now be between 70 and 100 due to higher traffic.\n\n3. **Impact on Traffic Signal**:\n   - The decision for the traffic light color is based on the traffic density.\n   - If the density is greater than 60, the traffic light will be 'red'.\n   - With the new density range of 70-100, any value will satisfy the condition `if density > 60`, resulting in a 'red' signal.\n\nTherefore, when the weather changes from 'sunny' to 'rainy', the traffic density increases significantly, which should indeed cause the traffic signal to change from green to red.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `check_weather()` function randomly selects one of three weather conditions: 'rainy', 'sunny', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. The `calculate_traffic_density(weather)` function determines the traffic density based on the weather:\n   - Rainy: 70-100 (higher density)\n   - Sunny: 20-50 (lower density)\n   - Cloudy: 40-70 (medium density)\n\n3. The `deploy_traffic_lights(density)` function decides the traffic light color:\n   - If density > 60, the signal is 'red'\n   - Otherwise, it's 'green'\n\n4. Initially, with 'sunny' weather:\n   - Traffic density is between 20-50\n   - Since all values in this range are ≤ 60, the signal will be 'green'\n\n5. If the weather changes to 'rainy':\n   - Traffic density will now be between 70-100\n   - All values in this range are > 60, so the signal will be 'red'\n\n6. Therefore, changing from 'sunny' to 'rainy' weather would indeed result in the traffic signal changing from green to red.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions (Sunny Weather):**\n   - The `calculate_traffic_density` function returns a value between 20 and 50 for sunny weather.\n   - Since the density is less than 60, the `deploy_traffic_lights` function will return 'green'.\n\n2. **Change in Weather (From Sunny to Rainy):**\n   - When the weather changes to 'rainy', the `calculate_traffic_density` function now returns a value between 70 and 100.\n   - This higher density value is greater than 60.\n\n3. **New Traffic Signal (Rainy Weather):**\n   - Given that the new density is greater than 60, the `deploy_traffic_lights` function will now return 'red'.\n\n4. **Emergency Brakes:**\n   - With the new signal being 'red', the `apply_emergency_brakes` function will return `True`, meaning emergency brakes are applied.\n\nTherefore, if the weather changes from 'sunny' to 'rainy', the traffic signal would indeed change from green to red.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
