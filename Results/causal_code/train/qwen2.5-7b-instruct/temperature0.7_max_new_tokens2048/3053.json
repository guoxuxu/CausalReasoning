Instead, it would adjust both the ill and healthy percentages based on the actual number of new cases.\n\nGiven these steps, the introduction of a vaccine increases the healthy percentage but does not directly cause a pandemic with a 5% increase rate in the ill population.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
