    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `is_system_overloaded` method checks if the temperature is greater than 100 or the CPU usage is greater than 90.\n2. If either condition is true, it returns `True`, indicating the system is overloaded.\n3. The `cooling_required` method first calls `is_system_overloaded`.\n4. If `is_system_overloaded` returns `True`, it immediately returns `True` for `cooling_required`.\n5. If `is_system_overloaded` returns `False`, it then checks if the temperature is greater than 80.\n6. If the temperature is greater than 80, it returns `True` for `cooling_required`.\n7.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `SystemMonitor` class has an `is_system_overloaded` method that checks if either the temperature exceeds 100 or the CPU usage exceeds 90.\n2.

If the temperature is greater than 80, it returns `True`, indicating cooling is required.\n5. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nGiven the sensor data:\n- Temperature: 101\n\nWe can see that the temperature (101) is greater than 100.\n\nSince the temperature condition in the `is_system_overloaded` method is met (`temperature > 100`), we don't need to check the second condition for CPU usage.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided code logic, the system will be considered overloaded due to the high temperature, and cooling will be required.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `SystemMonitor` class has an `is_system_overloaded` method that checks if the system is overloaded based on temperature and CPU usage.\n2. If the temperature is greater than 100 OR the CPU usage is greater than 90, it returns `True`.\n3. The `cooling_required` method first checks if the system is overloaded using `is_system_overloaded()`.\n4. If `is_system_overloaded()` returns `True`, it immediately returns `True` for cooling required.\n5. If not overloaded, it then checks if the temperature is greater than 80.\n6. If the temperature is greater than 80, it returns `True` for cooling required.\n\nGiven the sensor data indicates a temperature of 101:\n\n- This temperature (101) is greater than 100.\n- Therefore, the condition `self.sensor_data['temperature'] > 100` in the `is_system_overloaded` method will be `True`.\n\nSince the temperature alone meets the criteria for the system being overloaded, the `cooling_required` method will return `True` without even checking the CPU usage or the additional temperature threshold of 80.\n\nThus, the system does require cooling.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
