    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have an `Environment` class that initializes with a random temperature between -10 and 30 degrees.\n\n2. We create an instance of `Environment` and assign it to `env`.\n\n3. The `AirConditioner` class is initialized with the `env` instance.\n\n4.
