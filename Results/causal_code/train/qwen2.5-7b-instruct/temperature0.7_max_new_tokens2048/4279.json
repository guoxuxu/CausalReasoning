    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `analyze_weather` method checks the temperature and humidity levels to determine the weather status.\n2.

For other conditions (temperature <= 30), different statuses are assigned based on humidity.\n\nGiven this logic, we can see that for the 'hot and humid' status to be assigned, the following must be true:\n- Temperature > 30\n- Humidity > 70\n\nThe condition for 'hot and humid' explicitly requires the temperature to be above 30 degrees.

If either of these conditions is not met, a different status is assigned:\n   - If only the temperature condition is not met (i.e., temperature <= 30), the status will be 'just hot'.\n   - If only the humidity condition is not met (i.e., humidity <= 70), no specific status is mentioned for this case.\n   - If both conditions are not met, the status will be 'moderate'.\n\n4.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `WeatherAnalysis` class has an `analyze_weather` method that determines the `weather_status` based on the `temperature` and `humidity`.\n\n2.
