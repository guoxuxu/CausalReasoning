  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The code specifies that a performance rating above 8 results in a higher bonus rate (20% of the salary) compared to a rating just above 5 (which gets 10%). Therefore, increasing the performance rating from 6 to 9 will indeed increase the bonus according to the predefined logic.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Current Performance Rating (6):**\n   - Since 6 is not greater than 8 but is greater than 5, the bonus calculation for a performance rating of 6 would be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{bonus} = \\text{salary} \\times 0.1\n     \\]\n\n2. **New Performance Rating (9):**\n   - Now, the performance rating has increased to 9.\n   - Since 9 is greater than 8, the bonus calculation for a performance rating of 9 would be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{bonus} = \\text{salary} \\times 0.2\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - The bonus for a performance rating of 6 is \\( \\text{salary} \\times 0.1 \\).\n   - The bonus for a performance rating of 9 is \\( \\text{salary} \\times 0.2 \\).\n\nClearly, \\( \\text{salary} \\times 0.2 \\) is greater than \\( \\text{salary} \\times 0.1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the bonus does indeed increase when the performance rating increases from 6 to 9.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_bonus` takes two parameters: `salary` and `performance_rating`.\n\n2. The bonus calculation depends on the value of `performance_rating`:\n   - If `performance_rating` is greater than 8, the bonus is 20% of the salary.\n   - If `performance_rating` is between 5 and 8 (inclusive), the bonus is 10% of the salary.\n   - If `performance_rating` is 5 or less, there is no bonus.\n\n3. Let's consider the scenario where `performance_rating` increases from 6 to 9:\n   - When `performance_rating` is 6, it falls into the range 5-8, so the bonus would be 10% of the salary.\n   - When `performance_rating` is 9, it falls into the range >8, so the bonus would be 20% of the salary.\n\n4. Comparing the two scenarios:\n   - At `performance_rating` = 6, the bonus is 10% of the salary.\n   - At `performance_rating` = 9, the bonus is 20% of the salary.\n\nSince 20% of the salary is greater than 10% of the salary, the bonus does indeed increase when `performance_rating` increases from 6 to 9.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the function logic**:\n   - If `performance_rating` is greater than 8, the bonus is `salary * 0.2`.\n   - If `performance_rating` is between 5 (inclusive) and 8 (inclusive), the bonus is `salary * 0.1`.\n   - If `performance_rating` is 5 or less, the bonus is `0`.\n\n2. **Analyze the current situation with `performance_rating` of 6**:\n   - Since 6 is between 5 and 8, the bonus calculation would be `salary * 0.1`.\n\n3. **Analyze the new situation with `performance_rating` of 9**:\n   - Since 9 is greater than 8, the bonus calculation would be `salary * 0.2`.\n\n4. **Compare the bonuses**:\n   - With `performance_rating` of 6, the bonus is `salary * 0.1`.\n   - With `performance_rating` of 9, the bonus is `salary * 0.2`.\n\nSince `0.2` is greater than `0.1`, the bonus will indeed increase when the `performance_rating` increases from 6 to 9.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition (performance_rating = 6):**\n   - According to the code, since 6 is not greater than 8, it falls into the second condition.\n   - The bonus calculation for performance_rating > 5 is `bonus = salary * 0.1`.\n\n2. **New Condition (performance_rating = 9):**\n   - Now, 9 is greater than 8, so it falls into the first condition.\n   - The bonus calculation for performance_rating > 8 is `bonus = salary * 0.2`.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - When performance_rating is 6, the bonus is `salary * 0.1`.\n   - When performance_rating is 9, the bonus is `salary * 0.2`.\n   - Since 0.2 is greater than 0.1, the bonus does indeed increase when the performance_rating increases from 6 to 9.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Current Performance Rating (6):**\n   - The condition `performance_rating > 5` is true.\n   - Therefore, the bonus calculation is `salary * 0.1`.\n\n2. **New Performance Rating (9):**\n   - The condition `performance_rating > 8` is true.\n   - Therefore, the bonus calculation changes to `salary * 0.2`.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - When performance_rating is 6, the bonus is `salary * 0.1`.\n   - When performance_rating is 9, the bonus is `salary * 0.2`.\n   - Since `0.2` is greater than `0.1`, the bonus will indeed increase when the performance_rating increases from 6 to 9.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
