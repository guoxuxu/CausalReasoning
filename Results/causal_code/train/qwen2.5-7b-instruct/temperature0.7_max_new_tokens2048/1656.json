    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_bonus` determines the bonus based on the performance rating.\n2. If the performance rating is greater than 8, the bonus is 20% of the salary.\n3. If the performance rating is between 5 and 8 (inclusive), the bonus is 10% of the salary.\n4. If the performance rating is 5 or lower, there is no bonus.\n\nGiven that the observed bonus is higher, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- A bonus of 20% of the salary (the highest) would indicate a performance rating > 8.\n- A bonus of 10% of the salary would indicate a performance rating between 5 and 8.\n\nA bonus cannot be higher than 20% of the salary because that's the maximum defined in the function. Therefore, if the bonus is indeed higher, it must be 20% of the salary, which corresponds to a performance rating > 8.\n\nSo, observing a higher bonus does indeed allow us to infer that the employee must have had a high performance rating (specifically, one greater than 8).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_bonus` determines the bonus based on the `performance_rating` relative to specific thresholds.\n2. If `performance_rating` is greater than 8, the bonus is 20% of the salary.\n3. If `performance_rating` is between 5 and 8 (inclusive), the bonus is 10% of the salary.\n4. If `performance_rating` is 5 or less, there is no bonus.\n\nGiven that the observed bonus is higher, let's see which conditions could lead to a higher bonus:\n\n- A bonus of 20% (from a `performance_rating` > 8) would be higher than a 10% bonus.\n- A 10% bonus (from a `performance_rating` > 5) would be higher than no bonus (when `performance_rating` ≤ 5).\n\nTherefore, for the bonus to be higher, the `performance_rating` must have been greater than 5. However, this does not necessarily mean it was greater than 8. It could have been exactly 6, 7, or 8, which would also result in a higher bonus compared to a rating of 5 or below.\n\nThus, observing a higher bonus does not guarantee that the employee had a performance rating greater than 8; it only confirms that the rating was above 5.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
