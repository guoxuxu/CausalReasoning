    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Base Score Calculation**: \n   - The base score is calculated as the average of all grades: `base_score = sum(grades) / len(grades)`.\n\n2. **Bonus Addition**:\n   - If `bonus_enabled` is True, the maximum grade (`bonus`) is added to the base score.\n   - This can increase the `base_score` significantly because adding the highest possible value (the maximum grade) to the average can boost the overall score substantially.\n\n3. **Penalty Subtraction**:\n   - If `penalty_enabled` is True, the minimum grade (`penalty`) is subtracted from the base score.\n   - This can decrease the `base_score`, but it does not necessarily imply anything specific about whether the bonus was enabled.\n\n4. **Impact on Base Score**:\n   - The significant increase in `base_score` could be due to either the addition of the bonus (if `bonus_enabled` is True) or other factors like the distribution of grades.\n   - Without additional information, we cannot definitively conclude that `bonus_enabled` was set to True just based on the increase in `base_score`.\n\nGiven these points, an increase in `base_score` could be caused by various factors, and it does not exclusively imply that `bonus_enabled` was set to True.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_scores` calculates a base score which is the average of all grades.\n2. If `bonus_enabled` is True, the maximum grade (bonus) is added to the base score.\n3. If `penalty_enabled` is True, the minimum grade (penalty) is subtracted from the base score.\n4. We need to determine if an increase in `base_score` can definitively imply that `bonus_enabled` was set to True.\n\nTo analyze this:\n- An increase in `base_score` could be due to several factors:\n  - Adding the bonus (max grade) when `bonus_enabled` is True.\n  - Subtracting the penalty (min grade) when `penalty_enabled` is False.\n  - Simply because the average of grades increased on its own.\n\nHowever, an increase in `base_score` does not necessarily mean that the bonus was added. It could also mean that penalties were reduced or that the grades themselves became higher on average without any bonuses being added.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclusively say that an increase in `base_score` implies that `bonus_enabled` was set to True.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",

However, the magnitude of this increase depends on how much higher the maximum grade is compared to the average.\n- **Without Penalty**: Subtracting the lowest grade (penalty) would not affect the base score if `penalty_enabled` is False.\n- **With Penalty**: Subtracting the lowest grade (penalty) would decrease the base score slightly.\n\nFor `base_score` to increase significantly, the addition of the bonus must have a substantial effect. This means the maximum grade must be notably higher than the other grades and the average.\n\nHowever, a significant increase in `base_score` does not necessarily mean that `bonus_enabled` was set to True. There could be other scenarios where the base score might still increase significantly, such as if the grades are very close to each other but one outlier exists, and it happens to be the maximum grade when `bonus_enabled` is True.\n\nTherefore, while `bonus_enabled` being True could lead to a significant increase in `base_score`, it is not a definitive indicator on its own.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
