  "Explanation": "With the application of a 'SAVE30' coupon, the price drops by 30, lowering it from 100 to 70. To reach a final price of 80, an additional discount of 10 must have been applied, which would only occur if the individual is a student (since the age discount would have reduced it even more).

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The base price is 100.\n2. A 'SAVE30' coupon is used, so the coupon discount is 30.\n3.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Base Price**: The base price is set to 100.\n2. **Coupon Code**: A 'SAVE30' coupon was used, which means a discount of 30 is applied.\n3. **Final Price Calculation**:\n   - Final price = Base price - Age discount - Student discount - Coupon discount\n   - Given: Final price = 80\n   - Coupon discount = 30 (since 'SAVE30' was used)\n   - Therefore, 80 = 100 - Age discount - Student discount - 30\n   - Simplifying: 80 = 70 - Age discount - Student discount\n4. **Possible Combinations**:\n   - If the customer is not a student (student_discount = 0), then Age discount must be 20 (age < 18).\n   - If the customer is a student (student_discount = 10), then Age discount must be 10 (age >= 18).\n\nGiven these calculations, let's see if we can determine whether the customer is either under 18 or a student:\n\n- If the customer is under 18, the age discount would be 20.
