If so, it sets `isRaining` to true.\n   - `simulateStorm()`: This method sets `isRaining` to true and decreases the temperature by 5 degrees.\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `temperature < 5` → `isRaining`\n   - `simulateStorm()` → `temperature`\n   - `simulateStorm()` → `isRaining`\n\n4. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if a decrease in temperature necessarily means that `simulateStorm()` was invoked.\n\n5. **Reasoning**:\n   - A decrease in temperature can happen through two primary mechanisms:\n     1. Directly setting the temperature using `setTemperature(newTemp)` where `newTemp < 5` triggers `isRaining`.\n     2. Invoking `simulateStorm()`, which directly reduces the temperature by 5 degrees and sets `isRaining` to true.\n   - However, a decrease in temperature could also occur due to other factors not mentioned in the provided code, such as external methods or manual changes to the `temperature` variable outside the class.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - While `simulateStorm()` will definitely cause a decrease in temperature by 5 degrees, a decrease in temperature does not necessarily mean that `simulateStorm()` was the cause.
