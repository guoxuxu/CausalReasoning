    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `sales_performance` takes two parameters: `weather` and `advertising`.\n\n2. If the weather is 'sunny', sales increase by 20 units.\n3. If the weather is 'rainy', sales decrease by 10 units.\n4. If there is advertising, sales are increased by 50%.\n5. The base sales value is 50 units.\n\n6. Today's weather is randomly chosen from ['sunny', 'rainy', 'cloudy'].\n7. Advertising presence is determined by a random probability (more likely to not have advertising).\n\n8. To determine if today's sales are significantly higher than usual:\n   - Without any weather effect and no advertising: 50 units.\n   - With 'sunny' weather and no advertising: 70 units.\n   - With 'rainy' weather and no advertising: 40 units.\n   - With advertising and no weather effect: 75 units.\n   - With both 'sunny' weather and advertising: 105 units.\n   - With 'rainy' weather and advertising: 75 units.\n\n9. Considering the significant increase in sales would be to 105 units or more, we need to consider the scenario where the weather is sunny and there is advertising.\n\n10. Given that there are three possible weather conditions and only one of them (sunny) increases sales positively, and considering the presence of advertising is equally likely, the likelihood of having sunny weather when sales are significantly higher is relatively high compared to other scenarios.\n\nBased on this reasoning, if today's sales are significantly higher than usual, it is indeed more likely that the weather was sunny.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `sales_performance` takes two parameters: `weather` and `advertising`.\n\n2. If the weather is 'sunny', sales increase by 20.\n3. If the weather is 'rainy', sales decrease by 10.\n4. If there is advertising, sales are multiplied by 1.5.\n\n5. Without any special conditions, the base sales are 50.\n\n6. Considering the weather factors alone:\n   - Sunny: Sales = 50 + 20 = 70\n   - Rainy: Sales = 50 - 10 = 40\n   - Cloudy: Sales remain at 50\n\n7. With advertising, the sales for sunny would be: 70 * 1.5 = 105\n   - This is the highest possible sales scenario given the current logic.\n\n8. Without advertising, the highest sales would be from sunny weather: 70\n\n9. Therefore, if today's sales are significantly higher than usual, it is more likely that:\n   - The weather was sunny (which increases sales to 70 or 105 with/without advertising)\n   - There was also advertising (which could push the sales up to 105)\n\nGiven this analysis, if today's sales are significantly higher than usual, it is indeed more likely that the weather was sunny.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `sales_performance` takes two parameters: `weather` and `advertising`.\n\n2. The base sales value is set to 50.\n\n3. If the weather is 'sunny', sales increase by 20.\n   - So, if it's sunny, sales become 70.\n   \n4. If the weather is 'rainy', sales decrease by 10.\n   - So, if it's rainy, sales become 40.\n   \n5. If there is advertising, sales are multiplied by 1.5.\n   - This means, regardless of weather, advertising can increase sales up to 75 (if it's sunny) or 60 (if it's rainy).\n\n6. Without considering advertising, sunny weather increases sales from 50 to 70.\n   - This is a significant increase compared to the base value of 50.\n\n7. Rainy weather decreases sales from 50 to 40.\n   - This is a significant decrease compared to the base value of 50.\n\n8. Cloudy weather does not change the base sales value of 50.\n   - This is less of a change than the significant increase or decrease caused by sunny or rainy weather.\n\n9. Considering the random nature of advertising, while it can boost sales, it doesn't necessarily make sunny weather more likely to result in \"significantly higher\" sales compared to just being sunny.\n\nGiven these points, if today's sales are significantly higher than usual, it is indeed more likely that the weather was sunny because the maximum possible increase due to sunny weather (20) is greater than the maximum possible increase due to advertising (which would be 1.5 * 50 = 75, but this is less significant compared to the actual increase from sunny weather).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `sales_performance` function calculates sales based on weather and advertising.\n2. If the weather is sunny, sales increase by 20 units.\n3. If the weather is rainy, sales decrease by 10 units.\n4. If there is advertising, sales are multiplied by 1.5.\n5. Without any special conditions, sales start at 50 units.\n\nNow, let's consider the impact of sunny weather:\n- Sunny weather adds 20 units to the base sales of 50, resulting in 70 units.\n- Rainy weather subtracts 10 units from the base sales, resulting in 40 units.\n- Cloudy weather doesn't change the base sales, so it remains at 50 units.\n\nIf today's sales are significantly higher than usual, we need to consider what would cause this:\n- Sales could be significantly higher if advertising is present, as it multiplies the sales by 1.5.\n- However, even with advertising, the maximum sales would still be around 75 units (50 + 20 * 1.5).\n- Without advertising, the highest sales would be 70 units (50 + 20).\n\nGiven these points, if today's sales are significantly higher than usual, it is more likely that the weather was sunny because:\n- Sunny weather alone can result in 70 units, which is already quite high.\n- Even with advertising, the highest possible sales are 75 units, which is still higher than the typical 50 units but not necessarily significantly higher unless the advertising effect is also significant.\n\nHowever, considering the context of \"significantly higher,\" it's more likely that the weather being sunny played a crucial role, especially if the advertising effect is not as pronounced.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
