    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discount` takes two parameters: `price` and `is_member`.\n2. If `is_member` is True, the discount applied is 20%.\n3. If `is_member` is False, the discount applied is 10%.\n4. Given `price = 100` and `is_member = True`, the expected discount would be 20%.\n5. Applying the 20% discount to the price of 100 would result in:\n   \\[ \\text{final\\_price} = 100 \\times (1 - 0.2) = 100 \\times 0.8 = 80 \\]\n6. The problem states that the final discounted price is 80 even after an intervention.\n7. Since 80 is the expected result when `is_member` is True (which gives a 20% discount), it does not necessarily mean that `is_member` was set to True during the intervention.\n\nHowever, the fact that the final price is 80 could still be consistent with `is_member` being True, but it doesn't confirm it either way without more context about the intervention.\n\nGiven the information provided and the logic of the function, we cannot definitively conclude that `is_member` was set to True based solely on the final price being 80.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original function `compute_discount` calculates the final price based on whether the user is a member or not.\n2. If `is_member` is True, the discount is 20% (0.2).\n3. If `is_member` is False, the discount is 10% (0.1).\n\nGiven:\n- The original price is 100.\n- The final discounted price is 80.\n\nWe need to check if setting `is_member` to True can result in a final price of 80.\n\n4. Let's calculate with `is_member` as True:\n   - Discount = 20%\n   - Final Price = 100 * (1 - 0.2) = 100 * 0.8 = 80\n\n5. Now, let's calculate with `is_member` as False:\n   - Discount = 10%\n   - Final Price = 100 * (1 - 0.1) = 100 * 0.9 = 90\n\nFrom these calculations, we can see that if `is_member` is True, the final price would be 80, which matches the given final price.\n\nTherefore, it is possible for `is_member` to be set to True and still have the final discounted price be 80.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The problem states that after an intervention, the `discounted_price` remains 80.\n6.
