  "Explanation": "Doubling x will double y (since y = 2x). This ensures a significant change in z (z = y + 3). Depending on whether z crosses the threshold of 10, result will either increase or follow a new computation (either z - 5 or z + 5 will still lead to an increase if the initial z was below 10, or alter the difference if z was initially greater than 10).

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `complex_computation(x)` performs the following operations:\n   - `y = x * 2`\n   - `z = y + 3`, which simplifies to `z = (x * 2) + 3`\n\n2. The condition `if z > 10` determines the value of `result`:\n   - If `z > 10`, then `result = z - 5`\n   - If `z <= 10`, then `result = z + 5`\n\n3. Let's consider the case where we double `x` (let's call it `x'`):\n   - Original: `z = (x * 2) + 3`\n   - Modified: `z' = ((x' * 2) + 3) = ((2x) * 2) + 3 = (4x) + 3`\n\n4. Now, let's compare `z` and `z'`:\n   - For `z > 10`: `(x * 2) + 3 > 10` simplifies to `x > 3.5`\n   - For `z' > 10`: `(4x) + 3 > 10` simplifies to `x > 1.75`\n\n5. Since doubling `x` results in a value that is generally larger (unless `x` was very small), `z'` will usually be greater than `z` unless `x` was already quite small.\n\n6. However, the key point is that doubling `x` changes the base value used in the comparison (`z` vs `z'`). This means that even if `x` was just above 3.5, doubling it might push it over the threshold where the logic branches differently.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that doubling `x` will indeed change the resultant value in most cases, but not necessarily always.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `complex_computation(x)` starts by doubling the input `x` to get `y = x * 2`.\n\n2. It then adds 3 to `y` to get `z = y + 3`, which can be rewritten as `z = (x * 2) + 3`.\n\n3. The next part of the function checks if `z > 10`. If it is, the result is set to `z - 5`. Otherwise, the result is set to `z + 5`.\n\n4. Let's consider what happens when we double `x`:\n   - If `x = a`, then `y = a * 2` and `z = (a * 2) + 3`.\n   - If we double `x` to `2a`, then `y = 2a * 2` and `z = (2a * 2) + 3 = 4a + 3`.\n\n5. We need to check how this change affects the final result:\n   - For the original `x = a`:\n     - If `(a * 2) + 3 > 10`, then `result = ((a * 2) + 3) - 5`.\n     - If `(a * 2) + 3 <= 10`, then `result = ((a * 2) + 3) + 5`.\n   - For the doubled `x = 2a`:\n     - If `(2a * 2) + 3 > 10`, then `result = ((2a * 2) + 3) - 5`.\n     - If `(2a * 2) + 3 <= 10`, then `result = ((2a * 2) + 3) + 5`.\n\n6. Simplifying these expressions:\n   - Original: `result = (2a + 3 - 5)` or `result = (2a + 3 + 5)`\n   - Doubled: `result = (4a + 3 - 5)` or `result = (4a + 3 + 5)`\n\n7. Comparing the results:\n   - If `result` for `x = a` is `2a - 2` or `2a + 8`\n   - If `result` for `x = 2a` is `4a - 2` or `4a + 8`\n\n8. Clearly, doubling `x` will always lead to a different result unless `a` is specifically chosen such that both forms of the result are identical, which is not generally possible due to the linear nature of the operations.\n\nTherefore, the resultant value will definitely be different when we double `x` and nothing else is changed.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `complex_computation(x)` starts by doubling the input `x` to get `y = x * 2`.\n\n2. Then it calculates `z = y + 3`, which simplifies to `z = x * 2 + 3`.\n\n3. The critical part of the function is the conditional statement:\n   - If `z > 10`, then `result = z - 5`\n   - Otherwise, `result = z + 5`\n\n4. Let's consider the condition `z > 10`:\n   - This translates to `x * 2 + 3 > 10`, which simplifies to `x * 2 > 7` or `x > 3.5`.\n   - If `x > 3.5`, then `result = (x * 2 + 3) - 5 = x * 2 - 2`.\n\n5.

Comparing the two cases:\n   - When `x > 3.5`, `result = x * 2 - 2`\n   - When `x <= 3.5`, `result = x * 2 + 8`\n\nIn both cases, the result depends on whether `x` is greater than 3.5 or not. However, there is no overlap in the values of `result` for these two conditions. Specifically, if `x` is exactly 3.5, then:\n- `y = 3.5 * 2 = 7`\n- `z = 7 + 3 = 10`\n- Since `z = 10` is not greater than 10, `result = 10 + 5 = 15`\n\nIf `x` is slightly more than 3.5, say 3.51:\n- `y = 3.51 * 2 = 7.02`\n- `z = 7.02 + 3 = 10.02`\n- Since `z > 10`, `result = 10.02 - 5 = 5.02`\n\nWe can see that the result changes depending on whether `x` is just above or just below 3.5.\n\nTherefore, the resultant value is not definitely different; it depends on the exact value of `x`. \n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function starts with `y = x * 2`, which means y is always twice the value of x.\n\n2. Next, `z = y + 3`.
