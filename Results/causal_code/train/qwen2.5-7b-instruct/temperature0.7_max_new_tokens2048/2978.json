    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discount` takes two parameters: `price` and `is_member`.\n\n2. If `is_member` is `True`, the discount applied is 20%.\n3. If `is_member` is `False`, the discount applied is 10%.\n\n4. Given the initial values:\n   - `price = 100`\n   - `is_member = True`\n\n5. When `is_member` is `True`, the discount is 20%, so the final price would be:\n   \\[ \\text{final\\_price} = 100 \\times (1 - 0.2) = 100 \\times 0.8 = 80 \\]\n\n6. Now, let's consider what happens when `is_member` is `False`. In this case, the discount is 10%, so the final price would be:\n   \\[ \\text{final\\_price} = 100 \\times (1 - 0.1) = 100 \\times 0.9 = 90 \\]\n\n7. Comparing the two scenarios:\n   - With `is_member = True`, the final price is 80.\n   - With `is_member = False`, the final price is 90.\n\n8. Since 90 is greater than 80, the discounted price will indeed increase if `is_member` is set to `False`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

If `is_member` is `False`, the discount applied is 10% (0.1).\n4. The `final_price` is calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n5. We are given that `price = 100` and `is_member = True`, so initially the discount is 20%, and the final price is `100 * (1 - 0.2) = 80`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when `is_member` is set to `False`:\n\n6.

Now, let's consider what happens if `is_member` is set to `False`:\n   - The discount would then be 10%.\n   - The calculation for `final_price` would be `price * (1 - 0.1)`, which simplifies to `price * 0.9`.\n7.
