    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_salary` takes three parameters:\n   - `base_salary`\n   - `performance_rating`\n   - `years_of_experience`\n\n2. It calculates a bonus based on the `performance_rating` and adds it to the `base_salary`.\n\n3. If `years_of_experience` is greater than 5, an additional fixed amount (1000) is added to the bonus.\n\n4. The key point here is whether setting `years_of_experience` to exceed 5 will guarantee an increase in the total salary.\n\n5. Let's consider the conditions:\n   - If `years_of_experience` <= 5, only the performance-based bonus is added.\n   - If `years_of_experience` > 5, an additional fixed bonus of 1000 is added on top of the performance-based bonus.\n\n6. Since the additional fixed bonus of 1000 is only applied when `years_of_experience` exceeds 5, setting `years_of_experience` to any value greater than 5 will indeed guarantee an increase in the total salary compared to when `years_of_experience` is 5 or less.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the function and analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Base Salary and Performance Rating**:\n   - The `base_salary` is fixed.\n   - The `performance_rating` determines the initial bonus percentage (`bonus_percentage = 0.05 * performance_rating`).\n\n2. **Bonus Calculation**:\n   - The initial bonus is calculated as `bonus = base_salary * bonus_percentage`.\n\n3. **Years of Experience Check**:\n   - If `years_of_experience > 5`, an additional $1000 is added to the bonus.\n\n4. **Total Salary Calculation**:\n   - The final salary is computed as `base_salary + bonus`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the years of experience are manually set to exceed 5 years:\n\n- When `years_of_experience > 5`, the bonus is increased by an additional $1000.\n- This means that if all other factors (base salary and performance rating) remain constant, setting the years of experience to exceed 5 will indeed result in an increase in the total salary.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the function and analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_salary` takes three parameters: `base_salary`, `performance_rating`, and `years_of_experience`.\n\n2. It calculates a `bonus_percentage` which is 5% of the `performance_rating`.\n\n3. A `bonus` is then calculated as `base_salary * bonus_percentage`.\n\n4. If `years_of_experience` is greater than 5, an additional $1000 is added to the `bonus`.\n\n5. Finally, the function returns the sum of the `base_salary` and the `bonus`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `years_of_experience` is manually set to exceed 5 years while keeping `base_salary` and `performance_rating` constant.\n\n- When `years_of_experience` > 5, the additional $1000 is added to the `bonus`.\n- This means that for the same `base_salary` and `performance_rating`, if `years_of_experience` exceeds 5, the `bonus` will be higher than if `years_of_experience` were 5 or less.\n- Since the return value of the function is `base_salary + bonus`, setting `years_of_experience` to exceed 5 will indeed result in a higher total salary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the function and analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_salary` takes three parameters:\n   - `base_salary`: the base salary amount.\n   - `performance_rating`: a rating that influences the bonus percentage.\n   - `years_of_experience`: the number of years of experience.\n\n2. The bonus is calculated as follows:\n   - `bonus_percentage = 0.05 * performance_rating`\n   - `bonus = base_salary * bonus_percentage`\n\n3. If `years_of_experience` is greater than 5, an additional fixed bonus of $1000 is added to the total bonus.\n\n4. The total salary returned is the sum of the base salary and the calculated bonus.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition where `years_of_experience` is manually set to exceed 5 years, while keeping `base_salary` and `performance_rating` constant.\n\n- When `years_of_experience` > 5, the function adds a fixed $1000 to the bonus.\n- This additional $1000 is guaranteed to be added to the bonus if the condition is met.\n\nSince the additional $1000 is a fixed amount and is added only when `years_of_experience` exceeds 5, setting `years_of_experience` to exceed 5 will indeed guarantee an increase in the total salary, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the function `compute_salary` step by step to determine if manually setting the years of experience to exceed 5 years guarantees an increase in the total salary.\n\n1. **Base Salary Calculation**: The base salary is given as `base_salary`.\n\n2. **Bonus Percentage Calculation**: The bonus percentage is calculated as `0.05 * performance_rating`. This means the bonus is 5% of the performance rating.\n\n3. **Initial Bonus Calculation**: The initial bonus is then calculated as `base_salary * bonus_percentage`.\n\n4. **Experience-Based Bonus Check**:\n   - If `years_of_experience > 5`, an additional fixed bonus of $1000 is added to the initial bonus.\n   - If `years_of_experience <= 5`, no additional bonus is added beyond the initial bonus calculation.\n\nGiven that we are asked if manually setting the years of experience to exceed 5 years guarantees an increase in the total salary, let's consider the following:\n\n- If `years_of_experience` is less than or equal to 5, the total salary would be `base_salary + (base_salary * 0.05 * performance_rating)`.\n- If `years_of_experience` is greater than 5, the total salary becomes `base_salary + (base_salary * 0.05 * performance_rating) + 1000`.\n\nIn both cases, the first part of the salary calculation (`base_salary + (base_salary * 0.05 * performance_rating)`) remains the same regardless of whether `years_of_experience` is more or less than 5. However, when `years_of_experience` exceeds 5, an additional $1000 is added, which increases the total salary.\n\nTherefore, manually setting the years of experience to exceed 5 years does indeed guarantee an increase in the total salary, assuming all other factors (base salary and performance rating) remain constant.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Performance Rating (performance_rating) → Bonus Percentage (bonus_percentage)**:\n   - The bonus percentage is calculated as `0.05 * performance_rating`. This means that the higher the performance rating, the higher the bonus percentage.\n\n2. **Bonus Percentage (bonus_percentage) → Bonus (bonus)**:\n   - The bonus is calculated as `base_salary * bonus_percentage`. Therefore, if the bonus percentage increases, the bonus also increases.\n\n3. **Years of Experience (years_of_experience) > 5 → Bonus (bonus)**:\n   - If the years of experience exceed 5, an additional $1000 is added to the bonus. This is independent of the performance rating.\n\n4. **Bonus (bonus) → Total Salary (total_salary)**:\n   - The total salary is the sum of the base salary and the bonus. So, any increase in the bonus will lead to an increase in the total salary.\n\n5. **Base Salary (base_salary) → Total Salary (total_salary)**:\n   - The base salary is directly added to the bonus to get the total salary.
