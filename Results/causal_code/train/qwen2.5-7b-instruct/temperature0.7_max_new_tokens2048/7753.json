    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial value of `dailySteps` is 9500.\n2. The method `updateSteps(600)` is called, which adds 600 to `dailySteps`.\n3. The new value of `dailySteps` after adding 600 would be 9500 + 600 = 10100.\n4. The condition `if (dailySteps >= 10000)` is checked.\n5. Since 10100 is indeed greater than or equal to 10000, the condition evaluates to true.\n6. Therefore, `reachedGoal` is set to true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `dailySteps` variable is set to 9500.\n2. **Method Call**: The `updateSteps(600)` method is called.\n3. **Update Steps Logic**:\n   - Inside the `updateSteps` method, `dailySteps` is incremented by the provided number of steps (600).\n   - The new value of `dailySteps` will be \\(9500 + 600 = 10100\\).\n4. **Check Goal Condition**:\n   - If `dailySteps` is greater than or equal to 10000, `reachedGoal` is set to true.\n   - Since 10100 is indeed greater than or equal to 10000, `reachedGoal` is set to true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, after calling `updateSteps(600)` with `dailySteps` initially at 9500, `reachedGoal` becomes true.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial value of `dailySteps` is 9500.\n2. The `updateSteps(int steps)` method adds the passed-in steps to `dailySteps`.\n3. In this case, we call `updateSteps(600)`, which means we add 600 to the current `dailySteps` value.\n4. The new value of `dailySteps` will be 9500 + 600 = 10100.\n5. Inside the `updateSteps` method, there's an `if` statement that checks if `dailySteps` is greater than or equal to 10000.\n6. Since 10100 is indeed greater than or equal to 10000, the condition is satisfied.\n7. When the condition is satisfied, `reachedGoal` is set to `true`.\n\nTherefore, after calling `updateSteps(600)`, `reachedGoal` becomes true.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial value of `dailySteps` is 9500.\n2. The method `updateSteps(int steps)` takes an integer parameter `steps` which is added to `dailySteps`.\n3. In this case, `updateSteps(600)` is called, so we add 600 to the current value of `dailySteps`.\n4. Calculation: `dailySteps = 9500 + 600 = 10100`.\n5. The condition inside the method checks if `dailySteps >= 10000`.\n6. Since 10100 is indeed greater than or equal to 10000, the condition evaluates to true.\n7. As a result, `reachedGoal` is set to true.\n\nTherefore, after calling `updateSteps(600)` with `dailySteps` initially at 9500, `reachedGoal` will become true.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
