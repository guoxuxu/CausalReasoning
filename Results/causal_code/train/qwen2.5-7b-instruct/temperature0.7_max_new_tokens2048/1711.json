Inside `adjustEnvironment`, there is a conditional check: if `isRaining` is true, it calls two methods: `increaseHumidity()` and `triggerRainfallEvent()`.\n\nGiven this sequence of events, we can conclude that if `isRaining` is set to true, both `increaseHumidity()` and `triggerRainfallEvent()` will be called.\n\nSince the `increaseHumidity` method is explicitly called when `isRaining` is true, we can confidently say that the humidity will indeed increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Therefore, if `isRaining` is set to true, `increaseHumidity()` will indeed be called, leading to an increase in humidity.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that setting `isRaining` to true will result in an increase in humidity.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
