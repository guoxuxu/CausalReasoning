    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `searchProductByName` method is implemented to iterate over all products in the `products` list and check if any of their names match the provided name.\n\n2. If the method finds a match, it returns `true`.\n\n3. If no matches are found after checking all products, it returns `false`.\n\n4. For `searchProductByName('Widget')` to return `false`, it means that none of the products in the `products` list have the name \"Widget\".\n\n5. However, returning `false` does not necessarily mean that \"Widget\" was never added to the database. It could mean:\n   - No product with the name \"Widget\" exists in the current database.\n   - A product with the name \"Widget\" existed but has since been removed from the database.\n\n6. To conclusively say that \"Widget\" was never added, we would need additional information about the history of the database.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot definitively conclude that \"Widget\" was never added to the database solely based on the `searchProductByName('Widget')` returning `false`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
