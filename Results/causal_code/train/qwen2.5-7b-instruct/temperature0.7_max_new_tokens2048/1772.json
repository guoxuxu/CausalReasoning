In the scenario setup provided, the `customer` object has `is_subscribed` set to True (`Customer(\"user@example.com\", True, True)`).\n\n5. However, we need to consider the question: what if `customer.is_subscribed` was set to False?\n\n6. If `customer.is_subscribed` were set to False, the function would follow the else branch and print that no email is sent.\n\nTherefore, if the customer's 'is_subscribed' attribute is set to False, this will indeed prevent the email from being sent.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
