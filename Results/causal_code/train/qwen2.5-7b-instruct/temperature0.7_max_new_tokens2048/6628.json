    "Let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Volume**: The `MusicPlayer` instance `player` is created with an initial volume of 20.\n2. **Increase Volume**: The `increaseVolume()` method is called, which increases the volume by 10 (since it is currently below 100). This changes the volume to 30.\n3. **Set Volume to 70**: The `setVolume(70)` method is called, setting the volume to 70. Since 70 is within the valid range [0, 100], the volume is successfully set to 70.\n4. **Decrease Volume**: The `decreaseVolume()` method is called, which decreases the volume by 10 (since it is currently above 0). This changes the volume from 70 to 60.\n\nAfter these steps, the current volume is 60.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the status message will show a volume less than 70 after performing these operations.\n\n- The final volume is 60.\n- 60 is indeed less than 70.\n\nTherefore, the status message will show a volume that is less than 70.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
