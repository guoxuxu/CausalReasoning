    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Base Price**: The base price is set to 100.\n2. **Supply Factors**:\n   - If supply < 50, there's an increase of 20.\n   - If supply >= 100, there's a decrease of 10.\n   - Otherwise, there's an increase of 5.\n3. **Demand Factors**:\n   - If demand > 100, there's an increase of 15.\n   - Otherwise, there's a decrease of 5.\n4. **Promo Discount**:\n   - If `is_promo_active` is True, there's a discount of 20.\n   - Otherwise, no discount.\n\nNow, let's consider scenarios where the final price might be high:\n\n- **High Demand Scenario**: \n  - If demand > 100, the demand factor adds 15.\n  - If is_promo_active is False, the discount is 0.\n  - This can result in a high final price (e.g., 100 + 15 - 0 = 115).\n\nHowever, let's also consider scenarios where the final price might not necessarily indicate high demand:\n\n- **Low Supply with Promo Active**:\n  - If supply < 50, there's an increase of 20.\n  - If is_promo_active is True, there's a discount of 20.\n  - The final price would be 100 + 20 - 20 = 100, which is not high despite low supply.\n\n- **Moderate Supply and Demand**:\n  - If supply is between 50 and 99, there's an increase of 5.\n  - If demand is around 100, there's an increase of 15.\n  - If is_promo_active is True, there's a discount of 20.\n  - The final price could be around 100 (e.g., 100 + 5 + 15 - 20 = 95), which is not high.\n\nFrom these scenarios, we can see that a high final price does not always indicate high demand. It can also be influenced by other factors like supply levels and promotional discounts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the logic step by step to determine if a higher final price always indicates high demand.\n\n1. **Base Price**: The base price is set to 100.\n2. **Supply Factor**:\n   - If supply < 50, price increases by 20.\n   - If supply >= 100, price decreases by 10.\n   - Otherwise (50 <= supply < 100), price increases by 5.\n3. **Demand Factor**:\n   - If demand > 100, demand_factor is 15.\n   - Otherwise, demand_factor is -5.\n4. **Promo Discount**:\n   - If is_promo_active, promo_discount is 20.\n   - Otherwise, promo_discount is 0.\n\nNow let's consider different scenarios:\n\n### Scenario 1: High Demand (demand > 100)\n- Demand factor = 15\n- Base price = 100\n- Supply and Promo conditions can vary but will not affect the demand factor significantly.\n- Final price could be: \\(100 + \\text{supply adjustment} + 15 - \\text{promo adjustment}\\)\n\n### Scenario 2: Low Demand (demand <= 100)\n- Demand factor = -5\n- Base price = 100\n- Supply and Promo conditions can vary but will not affect the demand factor significantly.\n- Final price could be: \\(100 + \\text{supply adjustment} - 5 - \\text{promo adjustment}\\)\n\nFrom these scenarios, we see that high demand (demand > 100) would generally result in a higher demand factor (15), which could lead to a higher final price. However, this is not always the case because:\n\n- **Supply Factor**: If supply is very low (< 50), the price increase due to low supply might offset the positive effect of high demand.\n- **Promo Discount**: If there is an active promotion, the discount could reduce the final price regardless of demand levels.\n\nTherefore, while high demand generally contributes positively to the final price, it does not always guarantee a higher final price due to other factors like supply and promo discounts.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Base Price**: The base price is fixed at 100.\n2. **Supply Factor**:\n   - If `supply < 50`, the price increases by 20.\n   - If `supply >= 100`, the price decreases by 10.\n   - Otherwise, it increases by 5.\n3. **Demand Factor**:\n   - If `demand > 100`, the price increases by 15.\n   - Otherwise, it decreases by 5.\n4. **Promo Discount**:\n   - If `is_promo_active` is True, the price decreases by 20.\n   - Otherwise, it remains 0.\n\nNow, let's consider whether a higher final price always indicates high demand:\n\n- **High Demand (demand > 100)**: \n  - This would add 15 to the price.\n  - However, the final price can still be lower due to the supply and promo factors.\n  \n- **Low Demand (demand <= 100)**:\n  - This would subtract 5 from the price.\n  - But again, the final price can still be higher due to the supply and promo factors.\n\nGiven these factors, we need to check specific scenarios:\n\n- **Example with Low Supply (<50) and Promo Active**:\n  - Base: 100\n  - Supply increase: +20\n  - Promo discount: -20\n  - Final: 100 + 20 - 20 = 100\n  - In this case, even though demand might be high, the final price does not increase.\n\n- **Example with High Supply (>=100) and Promo Not Active**:\n  - Base: 100\n  - Supply decrease: -10\n  - Promo discount: 0\n  - Final: 100 - 10 = 90\n  - Here, despite high demand, the final price could be lower.\n\nFrom these examples, it is clear that a higher final price does not necessarily indicate high demand because other factors like supply and promo discounts can influence the final price.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
