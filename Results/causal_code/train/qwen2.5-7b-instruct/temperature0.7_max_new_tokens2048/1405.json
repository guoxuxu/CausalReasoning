    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Current Scenario**: The function `sales_prediction` calculates sales based on the price, advertising budget, and the day of the week.\n\n2. **Current Formula**:\n   - If it's Sunday: \n     \\[\n     \\text{sales} = (price \\times 0.9 + advertising \\times 1.2) \\times 1.5\n     \\]\n   - For other days:\n     \\[\n     \\text{sales} = (price \\times 0.9 + advertising \\times 1.1)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Impact of Increasing Advertising Budget**:\n   - **Sunday Scenario**: When increasing the advertising budget, the term \\(advertising \\times 1.2\\) increases.\n   - **Other Days Scenario**: When increasing the advertising budget, the term \\(advertising \\times 1.1\\) increases.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - On Sunday, the sales formula has an additional multiplier of 1.5 after the base calculation involving advertising.\n   - On other days, there is no such multiplier.\n\nGiven that we can control the day of the week to always be Sunday, let's compare the two scenarios:\n\n- **Without controlling the day**: Sales on Sunday would have higher sales due to the additional 1.5 multiplier compared to other days.\n- **With controlled day (always Sunday)**: Increasing the advertising budget will result in a more significant increase in sales because of the extra multiplier.\n\nTherefore, controlling the day of the week to always be Sunday and increasing the advertising budget would indeed have a more positive impact on sales.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the original function**:\n   - The function `sales_prediction` calculates sales based on `price`, `advertising`, and `day_of_week`.\n   - If `day_of_week` is 'Sunday', sales are calculated as `(price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.2) * 1.5`.\n   - For other days, sales are calculated as `(price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.1)`.\n\n2. **Impact of increasing advertising budget on sales for Sunday**:\n   - On Sunday, the sales formula is: `(price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.2) * 1.5`.\n   - Increasing the advertising budget (`advertising`) will directly increase the term `advertising * 1.2`.\n   - Since `1.5` is a multiplier, increasing `advertising` will proportionally increase the overall sales value.\n\n3. **Impact of increasing advertising budget on sales for non-Sunday**:\n   - On non-Sunday, the sales formula is: `(price * 0.9 + advertising * 1.1)`.\n   - Increasing the advertising budget (`advertising`) will directly increase the term `advertising * 1.1`.\n   - However, the multiplier here is `1.1`, which is less than `1.5`. Therefore, the proportional increase in sales will be less compared to Sunday.\n\n4. **Comparing the two scenarios**:\n   - By controlling the day of the week to always be Sunday, we can maximize the impact of increased advertising on sales because the multiplier `1.5` amplifies the effect more than the `1.1` multiplier used on non-Sundays.\n   \nTherefore, if we could control the day of the week to always be Sunday, increasing the advertising budget would have a greater impact on sales compared to not controlling the day.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Current Sales Calculation**:\n   - For any day except Sunday, the sales prediction is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{sales} = (price \\times 0.9 + advertising \\times 1.1)\n     \\]\n   - For Sunday, the sales prediction is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{sales} = (price \\times 0.9 + advertising \\times 1.2) \\times 1.5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Impact of Increasing Advertising Budget**:\n   - If we increase the advertising budget, both the base sales calculation for non-Sunday days and the special Sunday calculation will be affected.\n   - For non-Sunday days:\n     \\[\n     \\text{new\\_sales} = (price \\times 0.9 + (advertising + \\Delta) \\times 1.1)\n     \\]\n     where \\(\\Delta\\) represents the increase in the advertising budget.\n   - For Sunday:\n     \\[\n     \\text{new\\_sales} = ((price \\times 0.9 + (advertising + \\Delta) \\times 1.2) \\times 1.5)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparison with Non-Sunday Days**:\n   - The increase in advertising budget will have a higher multiplier effect on Sunday compared to other days because of the additional \\(1.5\\) multiplier.\n   - Specifically, the new sales on Sunday will be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{new\\_sales\\_sunday} = ((price \\times 0.9 + (advertising + \\Delta) \\times 1.2) \\times 1.5)\n     \\]\n   - This can be expanded to:\n     \\[\n     \\text{new\\_sales\\_sunday} = (price \\times 0.9 \\times 1.5 + (advertising + \\Delta) \\times 1.2 \\times 1.5)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{new\\_sales\\_sunday} = (price \\times 1.35 + (advertising + \\Delta) \\times 1.8)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the term \\((advertising + \\Delta) \\times 1.8\\) includes an additional \\(1.8\\) due to the increased advertising budget, it will have a greater positive impact on sales when the day is controlled to be Sunday.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, controlling the day of the week to always be Sunday and increasing the advertising budget will indeed have a more significant positive impact on sales.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
