    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes an input and performs two operations:\n   - Multiplies it by 2\n   - Adds 10 to the result\n\n2. The formula for the final result can be expressed as:\n   `result = (input_data * 2) + 10`\n\n3. To determine if increasing the input_value will always increase the final_result, we need to consider the relationship between these values.\n\n4. Let's take two different input values, say `x1` and `x2`, where `x2 > x1`.\n\n5. For `x1`:\n   - Modified data = x1 * 2\n   - Final result = (x1 * 2) + 10\n\n6. For `x2`:\n   - Modified data = x2 * 2\n   - Final result = (x2 * 2) + 10\n\n7. Since multiplication and addition are both monotonic functions (they preserve order), if `x2 > x1`, then:\n   - (x2 * 2) > (x1 * 2)\n   - Therefore, ((x2 * 2) + 10) > ((x1 * 2) + 10)\n\n8. This shows that increasing the input_value will always result in a larger final_result.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the code step by step to understand how the `final_result` is calculated based on the `input_value`.\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - The function `process_data(input_data)` takes an input value.\n   - It multiplies this input value by 2 (`modified_data = input_data * 2`).\n   - Then it adds 10 to the modified data (`result = modified_data + 10`).\n\n2. **Example Calculation with input_value = 5**:\n   - `modified_data = 5 * 2 = 10`\n   - `result = 10 + 10 = 20`\n   - So, `final_result = 20`\n\n3. **Conditional Check**:\n   - The condition `if final_result > 20:` checks if `final_result` is greater than 20.\n   - In our example, since `final_result` is exactly 20, the condition is false, so `output` is set to 'Low'.\n\n4. **General Case Analysis**:\n   - For any positive integer `input_value`, the calculation will be:\n     - `modified_data = input_value * 2`\n     - `result = (input_value * 2) + 10`\n     - `final_result = (input_value * 2) + 10`\n   - If we increase `input_value`, both `modified_data` and `result` will also increase proportionally.\n\n5. **Checking the Condition**:\n   - To determine if `final_result` always increases when `input_value` increases, let's consider two cases:\n     - Case 1: `input_value = 5` (as shown above, `final_result = 20`)\n     - Case 2: `input_value = 6`\n       - `modified_data = 6 * 2 = 12`\n       - `result = 12 + 10 = 22`\n       - `final_result = 22`\n   - Here, increasing `input_value` from 5 to 6 indeed increases `final_result` from 20 to 22.\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that for any positive integer `input_value`, increasing it will always result in an increase in `final_result`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `process_data` function takes an `input_data` parameter.\n2. It first multiplies `input_data` by 2.\n3. Then it adds 10 to the result of the multiplication.\n4. The `input_value` is initially set to 5.\n5. We call `process_data(input_value)` which gives us a `final_result`.\n6. If `final_result > 20`, the output is set to 'High', otherwise 'Low'.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we increase `input_value`:\n\n- If `input_value` increases, the multiplication by 2 will also increase.\n- Adding 10 to a larger number will result in a larger number overall.\n\nSo, if we increase `input_value`, the `modified_data` (which is `input_data * 2`) will increase, and consequently, `result` (which is `modified_data + 10`) will also increase.\n\nTherefore, increasing `input_value` will always lead to an increase in `final_result`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If we increase the `input_value`, both `input_data * 2` and the entire expression `(input_data * 2) + 10` will increase proportionally.\n4. Therefore, increasing `input_value` will always lead to an increase in `result`.\n5. Since `final_result` is directly assigned the value of `result`, increasing `input_value` will also increase `final_result`.\n\nGiven that the relationship between `input_value` and `final_result` is linear and positive, increasing `input_value` will always result in an increase in `final_result`.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Since the condition for setting `output` to 'High' is `final_result > 20`, and since `final_result` increases with `input_value`, the condition for 'High' output will also be met more easily as `input_value` increases.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if `input_value` is increased, the `final_result` will always increase because the relationship between `input_value` and `final_result` is linear and positive.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The function `process_data` takes an `input_data` and performs operations on it.\n   - The operations are:\n     - `modified_data = input_data * 2`\n     - `result = modified_data + 10`\n\n2. **Understanding the Operations**:\n   - `modified_data` is directly proportional to `input_data`.
