The `calculate_base_salary` function does not directly reference or modify `skill_level`. It only uses `experience` to determine the base salary.\n\n3. The `skill_level` is set once based on the initial value of `experience` when the script runs. It does not change dynamically within the function or elsewhere in the code.\n\n4. An increase in `experience` would only affect the `base_salary` calculation, but it wouldn't trigger a re-evaluation of `skill_level`.\n\nTherefore, an increase in experience will not cause a change in the skill level.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The `calculate_base_salary` function does not directly use `skill_level` to modify the base salary. It only uses `skill_level` in the final salary calculation.\n\n3. An increase in `experience` will change the value of `skill_level` as follows:\n   - If `experience` was initially between 5 and 8, an increase could make it greater than 8, changing `skill_level` from 'medium' to 'high'.\n   - If `experience` was initially less than or equal to 5, an increase could make it greater than 5 but not necessarily greater than 8, changing `skill_level` from 'low' to 'medium'.\n\n4.

We need to consider whether an increase in `experience` would change the value of `skill_level`:\n   - If `experience` is currently at 8 or less, increasing it will move it into the range where `skill_level` becomes 'high'.\n   - If `experience` is currently between 5 and 8, increasing it will keep it in the same range.\n   - If `experience` is already above 8, increasing it will not change the skill level.\n\n3. Therefore, the only scenario where an increase in `experience` will change the `skill_level` is when `experience` is increased from a value of 5 or less to a value greater than 5.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is that an increase in experience can potentially change the skill level.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic for determining the skill level:\n\n1. The skill level is determined by the `skill_level` variable.\n2.
