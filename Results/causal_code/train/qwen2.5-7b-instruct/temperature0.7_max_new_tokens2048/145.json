    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. It checks if the value of `data['year']` is greater than or equal to 2020.\n3.

Since we are specifically asked about the case where `data['year']` is 2021, and 2021 satisfies the condition `>= 2020`, the function will set `data['status']` to 'recent'.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
