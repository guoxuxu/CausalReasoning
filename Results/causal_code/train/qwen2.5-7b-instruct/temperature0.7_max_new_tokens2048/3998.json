    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the formula when `apply_discount_first` is False**:\n   - The formula used is: `final_price = base_price * (1 + tax) - discount`\n   \n2. **Effect of increasing `base_price`**:\n   - If we increase the `base_price`, every term involving `base_price` will be directly affected.\n   - Specifically, the term `base_price * (1 + tax)` will increase because both `base_price` and `(1 + tax)` are multiplied together.\n\n3. **Subtracting the `discount`**:\n   - Even though we subtract the `discount` from the result, the overall increase in the product `base_price * (1 + tax)` due to an increase in `base_price` will still result in a net increase in the final price.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the `base_price` is multiplied with a positive factor `(1 + tax)` and then the `discount` is subtracted, an increase in `base_price` will lead to an increase in the `final_price`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The formula for final price when `apply_discount_first` is False is:\n   `final_price = base_price * (1 + tax) - discount`\n\n2. If we increase the `base_price`, let's denote the new base price as `new_base_price > base_price`.\n\n3. The new final price with the increased base price would be:\n   `new_final_price = new_base_price * (1 + tax) - discount`\n\n4. We can compare this to the original final price:\n   `original_final_price = base_price * (1 + tax) - discount`\n\n5. To determine if the final price increases, we need to check if `new_final_price > original_final_price`.\n\n6. Substituting the values:\n   `new_final_price - original_final_price = [new_base_price * (1 + tax) - discount] - [base_price * (1 + tax) - discount]`\n\n7. Simplifying the expression:\n   `new_final_price - original_final_price = new_base_price * (1 + tax) - base_price * (1 + tax)`\n   \n8. Factoring out `(1 + tax)`:\n   `new_final_price - original_final_price = (new_base_price - base_price) * (1 + tax)`\n\n9. Since `new_base_price > base_price`, and `(1 + tax)` is always positive (assuming tax > 0), the entire expression is positive.\n\nTherefore, if the base price is increased, the final price will indeed increase when `apply_discount_first` is False.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the function**:\n   - The function `compute_final_price` calculates the final price based on the base price, tax rate, discount, and whether to apply the discount first.\n\n2. **Case when `apply_discount_first` is False**:\n   - In this case, the formula used is: `final_price = base_price * (1 + tax) - discount`\n\n3. **Effect of increasing `base_price`**:\n   - If we increase the `base_price`, we are directly multiplying it with `(1 + tax)` and then subtracting the `discount`.\n   - Since both the multiplication and subtraction operations involve the `base_price`, increasing the `base_price` will result in an overall increase in the `final_price`.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Let's assume initial values: `base_price = 100`, `tax = 0.10`, `discount = 10`\n   - When `apply_discount_first` is False:\n     - Initial `final_price = 100 * (1 + 0.10) - 10 = 110 - 10 = 100`\n   - If we increase `base_price` to 150:\n     - New `final_price = 150 * (1 + 0.10) - 10 = 165 - 10 = 155`\n   - Clearly, the `final_price` has increased from 100 to 155.\n\nTherefore, if the `base_price` is increased, the `final_price` will indeed increase when `apply_discount_first` is False.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the function to determine how the final price changes with an increase in the base price when `apply_discount_first` is `False`.\n\n### Given:\n- The function computes the final price based on whether to apply the discount first.\n- When `apply_discount_first` is `False`, the formula used is:\n  \\[\n  \\text{final\\_price} = \\text{base\\_price} \\times (1 + \\text{tax}) - \\text{discount}\n  \\]\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n1. **Base Price Increase**:\n   - If we increase the `base_price`, the term `\\text{base\\_price} \\times (1 + \\text{tax})` will also increase because it directly depends on the `base_price`.\n   \n2. **Tax Application**:\n   - The tax is applied as a percentage to the `base_price`. So, increasing the `base_price` will lead to an increased amount after applying the tax.\n\n3. **Discount Subtraction**:\n   - After calculating the increased price with tax, the fixed `discount` is subtracted from this total.\n   - Since the `discount` is a fixed value, its subtraction does not change the direction of the increase due to the base price.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- An increase in the `base_price` will result in an overall increase in the `final_price` because the tax component, which is directly proportional to the `base_price`, will increase more than the fixed discount can decrease it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine if the `final_price` will increase when the `base_price` is increased, assuming `apply_discount_first` is `False`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function:**\n   - The function computes the final price based on whether the discount is applied first or not.\n   - If `apply_discount_first` is `False`, the formula used is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_price} = \\text{base\\_price} \\times (1 + \\text{tax}) - \\text{discount}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Effect of Increasing Base Price:**\n   - We need to understand how changing the `base_price` affects the `final_price` when `apply_discount_first` is `False`.\n   - In this case, the formula involves multiplying the `base_price` by `(1 + tax)` and then subtracting the `discount`.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Formula:**\n   - When `base_price` increases:\n     - The term `base_price \\times (1 + tax)` will also increase because both `base_price` and `(1 + tax)` are positive values.\n     - Since the `discount` is subtracted from this product, the overall effect depends on the relative sizes of the increase in `base_price \\times (1 + tax)` and the `discount`.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that `base_price` and `(1 + tax)` are multiplied together, an increase in `base_price` will generally result in a larger increase in the product compared to the fixed `discount`.\n   - Therefore, as long as the `discount` is not so large as to completely offset the increase in `base_price \\times (1 + tax)`, the `final_price` will increase.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that if the `base_price` is increased and `apply_discount_first` is `False`, the `final_price` will indeed increase.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The formula for calculating `final_price` when `apply_discount_first` is False is:\n   `final_price = base_price * (1 + tax) - discount`\n\n2. We need to determine how an increase in `base_price` affects `final_price`.\n\n3. Let's consider a simple example:\n   - Original base_price = 100\n   - tax = 0.1 (10%)\n   - discount = 20\n   - With `apply_discount_first` set to False, the calculation would be:\n     `final_price = 100 * (1 + 0.1) - 20 = 100 * 1.1 - 20 = 110 - 20 = 90`\n\n4. Now, let's increase the base_price to 120 and recalculate:\n   - New base_price = 120\n   - Using the same tax and discount values, the calculation would be:\n     `final_price = 120 * (1 + 0.1) - 20 = 120 * 1.1 - 20 = 132 - 20 = 112`\n\n5. Comparing the two results:\n   - Original final_price = 90\n   - New final_price = 112\n\n6. We can see that as the `base_price` increased from 100 to 120, the `final_price` also increased from 90 to 112.\n\nTherefore, given the provided formula and conditions, if the `base_price` is increased while `apply_discount_first` is False, the `final_price` will indeed increase.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
