    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `setCookie` method takes three parameters: `name`, `value`, and `days`.\n2. If `days` is provided (i.e., it's not `undefined` or `null`), the method proceeds to create an expiration date.\n3. It creates a new `Date` object and sets its time based on the provided number of days, converting those days into milliseconds.\n4. It then formats this date as a UTC string and appends it to the cookie string with the format `expires=...;`.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude:\n\n- When `setCookie` is called with a non-null `days` value, it explicitly calculates and sets an expiration date for the cookie.\n\nTherefore, if `setCookie` is called with a specified number of days, there will always be an expiration date set for that cookie.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `setCookie` method takes three parameters: `name`, `value`, and `days`.\n\n2.

If `days` is truthy (i.e., it is not zero or any falsy value), the following block executes:\n   ```javascript\n   var date = new Date();\n   date.setTime(date.getTime() + (days * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));\n   expires = 'expires=' + date.toUTCString() + ';';\n   ```\n\n4. This block calculates an expiration date based on the current time plus the number of days provided, and then formats it into a string that can be appended to the cookie.\n\n5. If `days` is falsy (i.e., it is zero or any other falsy value), the `expires` variable remains empty, and no expiration date is set.\n\n6. The cookie is then set with the `document.cookie` property, including the `expires` parameter if it has been defined.\n\nTherefore, if the `setCookie` method is called with a specified number of days (`days` is truthy), there will always be an expiration date set for that cookie.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

This `Date` object is then modified to add the number of milliseconds corresponding to the number of days provided multiplied by 24 hours, 60 minutes, and 60 seconds, all converted to milliseconds.\n5. The `toUTCString()` method is called on this modified `Date` object to create an expiration string in UTC format.\n6.
