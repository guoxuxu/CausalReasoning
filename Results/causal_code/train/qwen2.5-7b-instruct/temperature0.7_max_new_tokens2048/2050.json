    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `adjust_heart_rate` method updates the heart rate based on the number of steps taken.\n2. The formula for adjusting the heart rate is: \n   - If active, heart_rate = 80 + (steps_count // 100)\n   - If not active, heart_rate = 60\n\n3. We need to determine when the heart rate becomes 90.\n4. Setting up the equation:\n   - 90 = 80 + (steps_count // 100)\n\n5. Solving for steps_count:\n   - 90 - 80 = steps_count // 100\n   - 10 = steps_count // 100\n   - steps_count = 10 * 100\n   - steps_count = 1000\n\n6. Therefore, the `increment_steps` method must have been called 1000 times to reach a heart rate of 90.\n\n7. The question asks if we can conclude that the method has been called at least 300 times.\n8. Since 1000 is greater than 300, the statement is true.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heart Rate Calculation**:\n   - The heart rate is calculated as `80 + steps_count // 100` when the activity is active.\n   - We need to determine if the heart rate can reach 90 based on the number of times `increment_steps` has been called.\n\n2. **Heart Rate Calculation**:\n   - When the activity is active, each call to `increment_steps` increases `steps_count` by 1.\n   - The formula for heart rate is `80 + steps_count // 100`.\n   - To get a heart rate of 90, we need `80 + steps_count // 100 = 90`.\n\n3. **Solving for Steps Count**:\n   - Rearrange the equation: `steps_count // 100 = 90 - 80`\n   - This simplifies to `steps_count // 100 = 10`\n   - Therefore, `steps_count` must be at least 1000 (since 1000 // 100 = 10).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The minimum number of times `increment_steps` needs to be called to achieve a heart rate of 90 is 1000.\n   - 300 calls would result in a heart rate of `80 + 300 // 100 = 80 + 3 = 83`, which is less than 90.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the 'increment_steps' method has been called at least 300 times if the heart rate is observed to be 90.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `adjust_heart_rate` method updates the heart rate based on the number of steps taken.\n2. When `active` is True, the heart rate is calculated as `80 + steps_count // 100`.\n3. We need to determine if the heart rate could reach 90 after calling `increment_steps` at least 300 times.\n\n4. If `increment_steps` is called 300 times:\n   - `steps_count` would be 300.\n   - Plugging this into the heart rate formula: \n     `heart_rate = 80 + (300 // 100) = 80 + 3 = 83`.\n\n5. Calling `increment_steps` 300 times results in a heart rate of 83, which is less than 90.\n\n6. To achieve a heart rate of 90:\n   - We need `80 + steps_count // 100 = 90`.\n   - Solving for `steps_count`: \n     `steps_count // 100 = 10`\n     `steps_count = 1000`.\n\n7.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `heart_rate` is set to 60 when the app is initialized.\n\n2. **Heart Rate Calculation**:\n   - When `active` is `True`, the `adjust_heart_rate` method updates the `heart_rate`.\n   - The formula for updating `heart_rate` is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{heart_rate} = 80 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{steps_count}}{100} \\right\\rfloor\n     \\]\n\n3. **Target Heart Rate**:\n   - We need to determine how many times `increment_steps` must be called to reach a `heart_rate` of 90.\n   - Setting up the equation:\n     \\[\n     90 = 80 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{steps_count}}{100} \\right\\rfloor\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     10 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\text{steps_count}}{100} \\right\\rfloor\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving for Steps Count**:\n   - For the floor division to result in 10, `steps_count` must be between 1000 and 1099 (inclusive).\n   - Therefore, the minimum number of steps required to reach a heart rate of 90 is 1000.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 1000 steps are required to reach a heart rate of 90, it means that the `increment_steps` method must have been called at least 1000 times, not just 300 times.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is no.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
