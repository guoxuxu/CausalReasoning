  "Explanation": "An increase in True values in the result can occur due to changes in either the 'data', 'threshold', or 'flag'. Change in 'flag' affects how 'data' is modified, but similar effects might also be caused by changes in 'data' magnitude or changes in 'threshold'. Therefore, attribution to 'flag' changes alone is incorrect without eliminating the influence of 'threshold' and 'data'.",
