    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` checks if 'age' is in the data.\n2. If 'age' is present, it adds an 'is_adult' key to the data dictionary.\n3. Then, it checks if both 'income' and 'expenses' are present in the data.\n4. If both 'income' and 'expenses' are present, it calculates 'savings' as `data['income'] - data['expenses']`.\n5. Finally, it returns the modified data dictionary.\n\nThe key point here is that for 'savings' to be added to the data dictionary, both 'income' and 'expenses' must be present. If either 'income' or 'expenses' is missing, 'savings' will not be calculated.\n\nTherefore, the presence of a 'savings' key in the data implies that both 'income' and 'expenses' were provided.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` processes the input `data`.\n2. It checks if 'age' is in `data`. If it is, it creates a new key 'is_adult'.\n3. Next, it checks two conditions:\n   - If 'income' is in `data`\n   - And if 'expenses' is in `data`\n4. If both these conditions are true, it calculates 'savings' as `data['income'] - data['expenses']`.\n\nNow, to address the question: \"Can the presence of a 'savings' key in data imply both 'income' and 'expenses' were provided?\"\n\n- For 'savings' to be calculated, the code explicitly checks for both 'income' and 'expenses' being present.\n- If 'savings' is present in the returned data, it means the calculation was performed.\n- Therefore, the presence of 'savings' implies that both 'income' and 'expenses' were indeed provided.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` checks if 'age' is in the data dictionary. If it is, it adds a new key 'is_adult' based on the age value.\n\n2. The function then checks if both 'income' and 'expenses' keys are present in the data dictionary. If they are, it calculates 'savings' as the difference between 'income' and 'expenses'.\n\n3. The question asks if the presence of a 'savings' key in the data implies that both 'income' and 'expenses' were provided.\n\n4. From the logic of the function, we can see that 'savings' is only calculated if both 'income' and 'expenses' are present in the data dictionary.\n\n5. Therefore, if 'savings' is found in the resulting data dictionary, it must mean that both 'income' and 'expenses' were indeed provided to the function.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` processes a dictionary called `data`.\n2. It first checks if the key 'age' exists in `data`.

    "Let's break down the function `process_data` to understand its behavior:\n\n1. The function checks if the key 'age' exists in the input `data`.\n2.
