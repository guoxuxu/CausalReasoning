  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Calling the 'add_funds' method increases the total funds in the portfolio. Once funds exceed 100000, the 'adjust_risk_profile' method is triggered within 'add_funds', which updates the risk profile to 'High'. This is a direct causal link from the cause (adding funds) to the effect (risk profile change) without intervention.",
  "causal_map": "add_funds → risk_profile; funds → risk_profile",
  "causal_map_integration": "Adding funds to the portfolio directly increases the funds available, which in turn directly influences the risk profile to become 'High' if the total funds exceed 100000.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `InvestmentPortfolio` class has an attribute `funds` which is initialized with the `initial_investment`.\n\n2. The `add_funds` method increases the `funds` by the specified `amount` and then calls the `adjust_risk_profile` method.\n\n3. The `adjust_risk_profile` method checks if `funds` are greater than 100,000. If they are, it sets the `risk_profile` to 'High'; otherwise, it sets it to 'Low'.\n\n4. In the provided code, we start with an initial investment of 50,000.\n\n5. We then call `portfolio.add_funds(60,000)`, which adds 60,000 to the existing 50,000, making the total funds 110,000.\n\n6. Since the `funds` are now 110,000 (which is greater than 100,000), the `adjust_risk_profile` method will be called and set the `risk_profile` to 'High'.\n\nTherefore, if the 'add_funds' method is called with a large amount that makes the total funds exceed 100,000, the 'risk_profile' will indeed be set to 'High'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the steps to reason through this:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - An `InvestmentPortfolio` instance is created with an initial investment of 50000.\n\n2. **Adding Funds**:\n   - The `add_funds` method is called with an amount of 60000.\n   - This increases the funds to 110000 (50000 + 60000).\n\n3. **Adjusting Risk Profile**:\n   - The `adjust_risk_profile` method is called as part of the `add_funds` method.\n   - It checks if `self.funds > 100000`.\n   - Since 110000 > 100000, the risk profile is set to 'High'.\n\n4. **Making Investment**:\n   - The `make_investment` method is called with an amount of 40000.\n   - This reduces the funds to 70000 (110000 - 40000).\n   - Regardless of this action, the risk profile was already adjusted when adding the large amount of funds.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, we can conclude that if the `add_funds` method is called with a large amount, the `risk_profile` will indeed be set to 'High'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

This method checks if the current funds are greater than 100000.\n   \n   - Since the funds are now 110000, which is greater than 100000, the risk profile is set to 'High'.\n\n4. **Making Investment**: The `make_investment` method is then called with an amount of 40000. This reduces the funds but does not affect the risk profile directly.\n\nBased on this reasoning, if the `add_funds` method is called with a large amount (in this case, 60000), the `risk_profile` will indeed be set to 'High' because the funds exceed 100000 after the addition.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
