    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Students list: `[{'id': 1, 'score': 85, 'active': True}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}]`\n   - Average score is calculated as (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5\n\n2. **Update Score**:\n   - We update the score of student 1 to 95.\n   - The updated list becomes: `[{'id': 1, 'score': 95, 'active': True}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}]`\n   - New average score is (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5\n\n3. **Deactivate Student**:\n   - We deactivate student 1.\n   - The list now is: `[{'id': 1, 'score': 95, 'active': False}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}]`\n   - New average score is 90.\n\n4. **Forcefully Change Score and Reactivate**:\n   - Let's say we forcefully change the score of student 1 to an exceptionally high value (e.g., 1000).\n   - The list now is: `[{'id': 1, 'score': 1000, 'active': False}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}]`\n   - If we reactivate student 1, the list becomes: `[{'id': 1, 'score': 1000, 'active': True}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}]`\n   - The new average score would be (1000 + 90) / 2 = 545.\n\nGiven this scenario, if we forcefully change the score of a previously inactive student to an exceptionally high value and then make the student active, it will indeed increase the overall average score significantly. However, the question specifically asks if it will increase the average score, which it does.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with two active students.\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=85, active=True\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n2. **Average Calculation**:\n   - The initial average score is (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5.\n\n3. **Change Score of Inactive Student**:\n   - Let's assume Student 1 was previously inactive and now we're making it active with a new score of 95.\n   - This does not affect the current average as Student 1 was already inactive.\n\n4. **Activate Student**:\n   - We activate Student 1 (who now has a score of 95).\n   - The new list of active students is:\n     - Student 1: id=1, score=95, active=True\n     - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n5. **New Average Calculation**:\n   - The new average score is (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5.\n\n6. **Effect on Average**:\n   - The new average (92.5) is higher than the previous average (87.5).\n   - However, this increase is due to the reactivation of an existing student with a higher score, not due to adding an entirely new student.\n\nGiven that we're only changing the score of an already active student (which was previously inactive), and this new score is higher than its previous score, the average will indeed increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We have two students with IDs 1 and 2.\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=85, active=True\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n2. **Average Calculation**: The initial average score is calculated as (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5.\n\n3. **Change Score of Inactive Student**: Let's assume Student 1 becomes inactive at some point. For example:\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=85, active=False\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n4. **Update Score**: Now, we update the score of Student 1 to an exceptionally high value (let's say 999). Note that Student 1 remains inactive.\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=999, active=False\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n5. **Re-activate Student**: We then reactivate Student 1.\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=999, active=True\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n6. **New Average Calculation**: The new average score is now (999 + 90) / 2 = 549.5.\n\nGiven this scenario, the overall average score does not increase because the inactive student's score (999) was not included in the previous average calculation when they were inactive. Therefore, adding this high score only increases the average when it should be calculated with all active students.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with two active students, each with a score.\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=85, active=True\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n2. **Average Calculation**: The initial average score is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} = \\frac{85 + 90}{2} = 87.5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Change Score of Inactive Student**: Let's assume there's a third student who was previously inactive (let's say id=3, score=70, active=False).\n\n4. **Update Score**: If we update the score of student 3 to an exceptionally high value, let's say 1000, and then activate them:\n   - New student list:\n     - Student 1: id=1, score=85, active=True\n     - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n     - Student 3: id=3, score=1000, active=True\n\n5. **New Average Calculation**: The new average score would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Average} = \\frac{85 + 90 + 1000}{3} = \\frac{1175}{3} \\approx 391.67\n   \\]\n\n6. **Comparison**: Compare the new average (391.67) with the old average (87.5). Clearly, the new average is significantly higher.\n\nTherefore, if we forcefully change the score of a previously inactive student to an exceptionally high value and then make the student active, it will indeed increase the overall average score.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We have two active students with scores 85 and 90.\n   - Average score = (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5\n\n2. **Update Score**:\n   - We update the score of student 1 from 85 to 95.\n   - The updated list is now: [{'id': 1, 'score': 95, 'active': True}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}].\n   - New average score = (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5\n\n3. **Deactivate Student**:\n   - We deactivate student 1.\n   - The list becomes: [{'id': 1, 'score': 95, 'active': False}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}].\n   - New average score = 90 (as only the active student's score is considered).\n\n4. **Forcefully Change Score of Inactive Student**:\n   - If we forcefully change the score of the inactive student (student 1) to an exceptionally high value, say 9999, but do not reactivate them, the list remains:\n     [{'id': 1, 'score': 9999, 'active': False}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}].\n   - Since the inactive student is not included in the average calculation, the average score remains 90.\n\n5. **Reactivate the Student**:\n   - Reactivating student 1 makes the list:\n     [{'id': 1, 'score': 9999, 'active': True}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}].\n   - New average score = (9999 + 90) / 2 = 5049.5\n\nSo, if we forcefully change the score of a previously inactive student to an exceptionally high value and then make the student active, it will indeed increase the overall average score because the high score will be included in the calculation of the average.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"

So, the scores remain 85 and 90.\n\n3. **Activate Student**: When we activate a previously inactive student, their score is added to the calculation of the average. However, since we haven't updated the score of any inactive student, the scores still remain 85 and 90.\n\n4. **Re-calculate Average**: The average score after activating a student (assuming the student's score remains unchanged at 85 or 90) would be recalculated based on the current active students' scores.\n\nGiven these steps, if we forcefully change the score of a previously inactive student to an exceptionally high value and then make the student active, this action does not actually contribute to increasing the overall average score because the student was inactive and thus did not influence the initial average.
