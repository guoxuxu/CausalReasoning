    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_health_index` computes an `adjusted_index` based on three parameters: `age`, `weight`, and `activity_level`.\n\n2. The `base_index` is determined by the individual's age:\n   - If age > 50, base_index = 70.\n   - If age ≤ 50, base_index = 100.\n\n3. A `weight_penalty` is added to the `base_index` if the weight is over 100:\n   - If weight > 100, weight_penalty = 20.\n   - If weight ≤ 100, weight_penalty = 0.\n\n4. The `adjusted_index` is calculated as:\n   `adjusted_index = base_index - weight_penalty + (activity_level * 10)`\n\n5. To determine if two individuals with the same `adjusted_index` must have the same `weight`, let's consider the formula again:\n   - The `adjusted_index` depends on the `weight` only through the `weight_penalty`.\n   - If `weight > 100`, then `weight_penalty = 20`.\n   - If `weight ≤ 100`, then `weight_penalty = 0`.\n\n6. Since the `adjusted_index` can be the same for different `weight` values (as long as the `weight_penalty` is the same), it is possible for two individuals to have the same `adjusted_index` but different weights.\n\nTherefore, having the same `adjusted_index` does not necessarily mean that two individuals have the same `weight`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The activity level is then factored in by adding (activity_level * 10) to the adjusted index.\n\nNow, let's consider whether having the same 'adjusted_index' implies the same 'weight':\n\n5. For two people to have the same 'adjusted_index', their base indices and weight penalties must be equal, along with their activity levels.\n6. The base index depends solely on age and cannot be changed within the function.\n7. The weight penalty depends on weight; if two people have different weights but both fall below or above 100 kg, their weight penalties could still result in the same 'adjusted_index'.\n8. Even if one person has a weight penalty and the other doesn't, as long as the difference in their adjusted indices due to weight matches the difference due to other factors, their 'adjusted_indices' could still be equal.\n\nGiven these points, it is possible for two individuals to have the same 'adjusted_index' even if their weights are different, because the weight penalty only applies if the weight exceeds 100 kg.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

The 'adjusted_index' is composed of three components:\n   - Base index (which depends on age)\n   - Weight penalty (which depends on weight)\n   - Activity level adjustment\n3. The base index is higher for those over 50 (70) compared to those 50 or younger (100).\n4. The weight penalty is only applied if the weight is over 100, adding 20 points to the penalty.\n5. The activity level adjustment increases the index by 10 for each unit of activity level.\n\nNow, let's consider if two individuals can have the same 'adjusted_index' without having the same 'weight':\n\n- If both individuals are over 50, their base index would be 70. They could still have different weights and activity levels that result in the same adjusted index.\n- If both individuals are 50 or younger, their base index would be 100. Again, different weights and activity levels could result in the same adjusted index.\n- Even if one individual is over 50 and the other is 50 or younger, it's possible for them to have the same adjusted index due to the weight and activity level adjustments.\n\nGiven these points, it's clear that two individuals can have the same 'adjusted_index' even if their 'weights' are different. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

Let's consider the possible values for `adjusted_index`:\n   - For age ≤ 50, base_index = 100\n     - If weight > 100, weight_penalty = 20, so adjusted_index could be between 80 and 120.\n     - If weight ≤ 100, weight_penalty = 0, so adjusted_index could be between 100 and 140.\n   - For age > 50, base_index = 70\n     - If weight > 100, weight_penalty = 20, so adjusted_index could be between 50 and 90.\n     - If weight ≤ 100, weight_penalty = 0, so adjusted_index could be between 70 and 110.\n\n7. Given these ranges, it's clear that the `adjusted_index` is influenced by both `weight` and `activity_level`.

For example, if \\( w_A = 90 \\) and \\( w_B = 80 \\), both could result in the same adjusted index if the other factors balance out.\n\n#### Case 2: Both Individuals Have Age > 50\n- Base index for both is 70.\n- Similar logic applies as in Case 1 but with base_index = 70 instead of 100.\n\nAgain, this does not necessarily imply that \\( w_A = w_B \\).\n\n#### Mixed Cases:\n- One individual has age > 50 and the other has age ≤ 50.\n- This would make the base indices different, so it's impossible for them to have the same adjusted index unless the differences are perfectly balanced by other factors, which is highly unlikely without specific values provided.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the calculations and the possible variations in the weight penalty based on weight, we cannot conclusively say that two individuals with the same 'adjusted_index' must have the same 'weight'.
