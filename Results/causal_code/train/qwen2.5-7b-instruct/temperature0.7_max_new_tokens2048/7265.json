  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The `adjust_temp` method adds the change to `self.temp`. If the change results in a temperature higher than 25, it caps the temperature at 25. So, after the adjustment of +3 degrees to 24, the temperature will be set to 25.",

    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial temperature is 24 degrees.\n2. The temperature is adjusted by +3 degrees.\n3. The new temperature would be 24 + 3 = 27 degrees.\n4. The `adjust_temp` method checks if the new temperature exceeds 25.\n5.
