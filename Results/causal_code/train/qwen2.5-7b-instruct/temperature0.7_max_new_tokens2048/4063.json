    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `deploy_airbags` function determines whether to deploy airbags based on the speed of the vehicle.\n2.

We are asked if the airbag status being 'not deploy' means the speed was 50 or less.\n\nGiven these points, we can directly conclude that if the airbag status is 'not deploy', it must be because the speed was 50 or less, according to the logic defined in the `deploy_airbags` function.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

If the speed is not greater than 50 (i.e., it is 50 or less), the function returns 'not deploy':\n   ```python\n   return 'not deploy'\n   ```\n\n3.
