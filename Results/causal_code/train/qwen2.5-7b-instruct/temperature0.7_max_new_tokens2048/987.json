    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Class Structure**: The `MotionSensor` class has methods to activate and deactivate its state (`isActive`), and it tracks the number of movements detected (`detectedMovements`).\n\n2. **Alarm Trigger Condition**:\n   - The method `isAlarmTriggered()` checks two conditions:\n     1. `isActive` must be true.\n     2. `detectedMovements` must be greater than 5.\n\n3. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if recording that the alarm has been triggered allows us to conclude that the sensor was previously activated.\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - For the alarm to trigger, both conditions must be met:\n     - `isActive` must be true.\n     - `detectedMovements` must be greater than 5.\n   - If the alarm has been triggered, it means both conditions were satisfied at some point.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the alarm has been triggered, we know for sure that `isActive` was true and `detectedMovements` exceeded 5 at some point. Therefore, we can deduce that the sensor was indeed activated at some point before the alarm was triggered.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `MotionSensor` class has methods to activate and deactivate it.\n2. It also has a method to detect movements, which increments a counter when the sensor is active.\n3. The alarm is triggered if both conditions are met:\n   - The sensor is active (`isActive` is true)\n   - More than 5 movements have been detected (`detectedMovements > 5`)\n4. If we know the alarm has been triggered, we know:\n   - The sensor must have been active at some point (since `isActive` is true when the alarm triggers)\n   - At least 6 movements must have been detected (since `detectedMovements > 5`)\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce that for the alarm to trigger, the sensor must have been activated at some point prior to the detection of more than 5 movements.\n\nTherefore, if we record that the alarm has been triggered, we can indeed intervene and deduce that the sensor was previously activated.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The `isAlarmTriggered()` method checks if both the sensor is active and more than 5 movements have been detected.\n4. If the alarm is triggered, it means `isAlarmTriggered()` returned true.\n\nNow, let's consider what would need to happen for the alarm to be triggered:\n- The sensor must be active (`isActive` must be true).\n- More than 5 movements must have been detected (`detectedMovements` must be greater than 5).\n\nGiven that the alarm has been triggered, we know:\n- The sensor was indeed active at some point (since `detectedMovements` would not exceed 5 if the sensor was never active).\n- The sensor detected more than 5 movements while it was active.\n\nTherefore, if we record that the alarm has been triggered, we can deduce that the sensor was previously activated.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
