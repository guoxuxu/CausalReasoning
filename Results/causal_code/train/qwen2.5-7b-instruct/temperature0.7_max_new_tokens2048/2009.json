If 'error' is not present, it sets `data['status']` to 'successful'.\n\nGiven that the question asks if the 'status' of the returned data will always be 'successful' when `flag` is set to True, we need to consider the following:\n\n- The condition for setting 'status' to 'failed' is solely based on whether 'error' is a key in `data`.\n- Setting `flag` to True does not directly influence whether 'error' is a key in `data`.\n\nTherefore, if 'error' is a key in `data`, regardless of `flag` being True or False, the status will be 'failed'. \n\nSo, the 'status' will not always be 'successful' when `flag` is set to True.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the function step by step:\n\n1. **Condition Check**: The function first checks if `flag` is `True`.\n2. **Data Modification**: If `flag` is `True`, it multiplies the value of `data['value']` by 2.\n3. **Set Modified Flag**: It sets `data['modified']` to `True`.\n4. **Error Handling**: It checks if `data` contains a key `'error'`. \n   - If `'error'` is present, it sets `data['status']` to `'failed'`.\n   - If `'error'` is not present, it sets `data['status']` to `'successful'`.\n\nGiven that we are asked specifically about the scenario where `flag` is set to `True`, let's consider this case:\n\n- When `flag` is `True`, the function does not check for the presence of `'error'` directly. Instead, it proceeds with setting `data['modified']` to `True` and then determines the status based on whether `'error'` is present.\n\nSince the function explicitly sets the status to `'successful'` when `'error'` is not present, and does not override this status regardless of the value of `flag`, the status will indeed be `'successful'` unless there is an `'error'` in the data.\n\nHowever, since the question specifies that we should only consider the case where `flag` is `True`, and the function does not depend on `flag` for setting the status (it only depends on the presence of `'error'`), the status can still be `'successful'` even when `flag` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThe status will not always be `'successful'` because if `'error'` is present in the data, the status will be `'failed'`, irrespective of the value of `flag`.",

The question asks specifically about the scenario where `flag` is set to True.\n\n6. Setting `flag` to True does not directly affect the status based on the conditions provided. The status is determined by whether 'error' is in `data`, regardless of the value of `flag`.\n\n7. Therefore, the status can be either 'successful' or 'failed' depending on whether 'error' is in `data`, irrespective of the value of `flag`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the status is not always 'successful' when `flag` is True.
