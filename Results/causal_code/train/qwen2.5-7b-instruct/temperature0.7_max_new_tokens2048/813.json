    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the `castVote` method**:\n   - This method is responsible for adding a vote for a specific candidate.\n   - It increments `totalVotes` by 1.\n   - It also updates the count of votes for the specified candidate in the `votesPerCandidate` HashMap.\n\n2. **Effect on `totalVotes`**:\n   - Every time `castVote` is called, `totalVotes` is incremented by 1.\n   - This means that each call to `castVote` directly increases the value of `totalVotes`.\n\n3. **Effect on votes for a specific candidate**:\n   - When `castVote` is called with a specific candidate, the corresponding value in the `votesPerCandidate` HashMap is incremented by 1.\n   - This increases the number of votes recorded for that candidate.\n\n4. **Relationship between the two**:\n   - Increasing the votes for a specific candidate via `castVote` does indeed lead to an increase in `totalVotes`.\n   - This is because every time a vote is cast (regardless of which candidate it is for), `totalVotes` is incremented.\n\nTherefore, based on the logic and implementation provided, increasing the votes for a specific candidate does lead to an increase in `totalVotes`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1.

The `castVote(String candidate)` method is responsible for incrementing the vote counts:\n   - It increments `totalVotes` by 1.\n   - It then updates the `votesPerCandidate` map to increment the count for the specified candidate.\n\n3. When we call `castVote` with a specific candidate, it does two things:\n   - Increases the overall `totalVotes` by 1.\n   - Increases the count for that specific candidate in the `votesPerCandidate` map.\n\n4. Therefore, every time a vote is cast for any candidate, both the `totalVotes` and the candidate's specific vote count increase.\n\nGiven this analysis, increasing the votes for a specific candidate indeed leads to an increase in `totalVotes`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
