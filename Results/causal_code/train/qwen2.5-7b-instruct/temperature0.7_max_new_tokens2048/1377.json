    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The Thermostat class has two main states:\n   - Power (turned on/off)\n   - Temperature (settable when power is on)\n\n2. When the power is turned on:\n   - The `turnPowerOn()` method sets `power` to true.\n\n3. When the power is off:\n   - The `turnPowerOff()` method sets `power` to false.\n\n4. The `setTemperature(int newTemp)` method only adjusts the temperature if the power is on.\n\n5. If the external control script does the following:\n   - Calls `turnPowerOn()` to turn the power on.\n   - Then calls `setTemperature(newTemp)` with a specific new temperature.\n\n6. In this scenario, the `setTemperature(newTemp)` method will execute because the power is on, and it will update the `temperature` field to the new value specified by the script.\n\nTherefore, the temperature will indeed be adjusted to the new setting specified by the script.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `Thermostat` class has a `power` attribute that controls whether the thermostat can function.\n2. The `setTemperature` method checks if `power` is `true` before updating the `temperature`.\n3. An external control script would need to:\n   - Call `turnPowerOn()` to set `power` to `true`.\n   - Then call `setTemperature(int newTemp)` with the desired new temperature.\n\nGiven these steps:\n\n4. If the external script only calls `setTemperature(int newTemp)` without first turning the power on, the `setTemperature` method will not change the `temperature` because it requires `power` to be `true`.\n\n5. However, if the script does call `turnPowerOn()` before calling `setTemperature`, then `power` will be `true`, and `setTemperature` will update the `temperature` to the new value.\n\nTherefore, the temperature will be adjusted to the new setting specified by the script if and only if the power is turned on before setting the temperature.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `Thermostat` class to determine if the temperature will be adjusted when the power is turned on and a new temperature is set:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The thermostat is initialized with a default temperature of 22°C and power is turned off by default.\n   \n2. **Turning Power On**: \n   - The method `turnPowerOn()` sets the `power` variable to `true`.\n\n3. **Setting Temperature**:\n   - The method `setTemperature(int newTemp)` checks if the `power` is `true`.\n   - If `power` is `true`, it updates the `temperature` to the new value provided.\n\n4. **External Control Script**:\n   - First, the script would call `turnPowerOn()` to turn the power on.\n   - Then, it would call `setTemperature(newTemp)` to set the desired temperature.\n\nGiven this sequence of operations, let's reason through the steps:\n\n- When the script calls `turnPowerOn()`, `power` becomes `true`.\n- Subsequently, when the script calls `setTemperature(newTemp)`, the condition `if (power)` evaluates to `true`.\n- As a result, the `temperature` is updated to the new value specified by `newTemp`.\n\nTherefore, the temperature will indeed be adjusted to the new setting specified by the script.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
