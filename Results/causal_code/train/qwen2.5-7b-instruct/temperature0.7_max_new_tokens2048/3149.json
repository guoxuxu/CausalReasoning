    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Initial balance: 100\n2. Deposit of 50: Balance becomes 150\n3. Withdrawal of 30: Balance becomes 120\n4. Monthly interest of 5% applied: \n   - Interest calculation: 120 * (5/100) = 6\n   - New balance: 120 + 6 = 126\n\nNow, let's consider the possible sources of the increase to the final balance of 126:\n\n- The deposit of 50 is no longer relevant since it was already accounted for.\n- The withdrawal of 30 is also not the cause as it resulted in a lower balance.\n- The monthly interest addition of 6 is the only factor that directly increased the balance after the withdrawal.\n\nGiven that there were no other interventions mentioned (such as a reversal of the withdrawal), we can conclude that the increase in balance to 126 was solely due to the application of monthly interest.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze the operations step by step to determine if we can trace the increase in balance back to a specific cause:\n\n1. **Initial Balance**: The account starts with an initial balance of 100.\n\n2. **Deposit**: The `deposit` method adds 50 to the balance.\n   - New balance: 100 + 50 = 150\n\n3. **Withdrawal**: The `withdraw` method subtracts 30 from the balance.\n   - New balance: 150 - 30 = 120\n\n4. **Monthly Interest Addition**: The `add_monthly_interest` method increases the balance by 5%.\n   - Interest added: 120 * (5 / 100) = 6\n   - New balance: 120 + 6 = 126\n\nAfter these operations, the final balance is 126.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: Can we determine if the balance increase was caused specifically by a deposit, a withdrawal reversal, or interest application without additional intervention?\n\n- **Deposit**: The deposit was for a fixed amount of 50. We know it happened, but we cannot distinguish it from other deposits or reversals without more context.\n- **Withdrawal Reversal**: There is no indication of any reversal operation in the provided code. The `withdraw` method simply reduces the balance if the amount is less than or equal to the current balance.\n- **Interest Application**: The interest is calculated based on the current balance, so it will always be applied as long as there is a positive balance.\n\nGiven the sequence of operations and the nature of the methods, we cannot definitively trace the exact cause of the balance increase to a single operation without additional information about the state of the account before each operation or explicit records of transactions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Balance**: The account starts with an initial balance of 100.\n\n2. **Deposit**: The `deposit` method is called with an amount of 50. This increases the balance to 150.\n   \n3. **Withdrawal**: The `withdraw` method is called with an amount of 30. This decreases the balance from 150 to 120.\n\n4. **Monthly Interest Addition**: The `add_monthly_interest` method is called with a rate of 5%. This increases the balance by 5% of 120, which is 6. Therefore, the new balance becomes 126.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible sources of the increase in balance:\n\n- **Deposit**: A deposit directly increases the balance by the specified amount. In our case, there was only one deposit of 50, but the final balance increase is 6, not 50. So, it's not a direct result of a deposit.\n\n- **Withdrawal Reversal**: If a withdrawal had been reversed, it would increase the balance by the withdrawn amount (30), resulting in a balance of 180. However, the final balance is 126, which does not match the scenario of a withdrawal reversal.\n\n- **Interest Application**: The balance increased by 6 due to the addition of monthly interest at a rate of 5%. This matches the calculation done after the withdrawal.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that the increase in balance was specifically caused by the application of monthly interest, as no other action directly led to a balance increase of 6.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}, because we cannot determine that the balance increase was caused specifically by a deposit, a withdrawal reversal, or any other specific action without additional intervention; it was clearly due to the interest application.",

This increases the balance by 5% of the current balance (120 * 5/100 = 6), resulting in a new balance of 126.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios for the increase in balance:\n\n- **Specifically by a Deposit**: The deposit of 50 was made before any other transactions. However, after the deposit, there was a withdrawal and then interest was added. So, the increase cannot be solely due to the deposit.\n\n- **Specifically by a Withdrawal Reversal**: There was no withdrawal that was reversed in this sequence of operations. The withdrawal simply reduced the balance and did not get reversed.\n\n- **Specifically by Interest Application**: The interest was applied at the end of the sequence, increasing the balance from 120 to 126. This is a direct result of applying interest and not due to any other specific action.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that the increase in balance to 126 could have been caused by the addition of interest, but not specifically by a deposit or a withdrawal reversal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the sequence of operations step by step to determine if we can identify which specific action caused an increase in the balance:\n\n1. **Initial Balance**: The account starts with an initial balance of 100.\n\n2. **Deposit**: The `deposit` method is called with an amount of 50.\n   - New balance = 100 + 50 = 150.\n\n3. **Withdrawal**: The `withdraw` method is called with an amount of 30.\n   - New balance = 150 - 30 = 120.\n\n4. **Monthly Interest**: The `add_monthly_interest` method is called with a rate of 5%.\n   - Interest = 120 * (5/100) = 6.\n   - New balance = 120 + 6 = 126.\n\nNow, let's consider if we can determine the cause of the increase from the final balance of 126:\n\n- **Deposit**: The deposit of 50 was the only direct addition to the balance. No other transaction directly added to the balance.\n- **Withdrawal**: The withdrawal reduced the balance from 150 to 120. There was no \"withdrawal reversal.\"\n- **Interest**: The interest calculation added 6 to the balance.\n\nGiven these steps, the increase from 120 to 126 can only be attributed to the application of monthly interest. There is no information that suggests any other direct additions or subtractions from the balance after the initial deposit and withdrawal.\n\nTherefore, the increase in balance cannot be determined to have been caused specifically by a deposit, a withdrawal reversal, or any other action besides the application of interest.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
