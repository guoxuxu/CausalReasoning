  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Raising the threshold to 20 and then ordering 15 apples only reduces the stock from 50 to 35. However, if the temporary threshold is 20 (not shown in the original code but assumed for the scenario), then this stock level is above the new threshold, hence no restocking occurs based on the given conditions.",
  "causal_map": "order_item → restock_item; apple_order_quantity > 0 → stock_decrease; stock_decrease → check_min_threshold; check_min_threshold → restock_if_needed",
  "causal_map_integration": "When an order is placed for apples, the stock decreases. If the remaining stock falls below the current minimum threshold, a restock action is triggered. Raising the minimum threshold temporarily to 20 and ordering 15 apples may or may not trigger a restock depending on the initial stock level.",
