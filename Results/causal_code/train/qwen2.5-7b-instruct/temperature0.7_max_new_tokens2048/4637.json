At both sensor readings of 150 and 110, the formula applied is (sensor_reading * 1.05) + 5.

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the function `update_temperature`:**\n   - The function takes two parameters: `sensor_reading` and `adjustment_factor`.\n   - If `sensor_reading` is greater than 100, it applies an adjustment factor of 1.05 and adds 5.\n   - If `sensor_reading` is between 50 and 100 (inclusive), it simply multiplies by the adjustment factor.\n   - Otherwise, it subtracts 10 from the `sensor_reading`.\n\n2. **Calculate the temperature for `sensor_value = 110`:**\n   - Since 110 > 100, we use the first condition.\n   - The calculation is: \\( 110 \\times 1.05 + 5 \\)\n   - \\( 110 \\times 1.05 = 115.5 \\)\n   - Adding 5 gives us \\( 115.5 + 5 = 120.5 \\)\n   - So, the temperature for `sensor_value = 110` is 120.5.\n\n3. **Calculate the temperature for `sensor_value = 150`:**\n   - Since 150 > 100, we use the first condition again.\n   - The calculation is: \\( 150 \\times 1.05 + 5 \\)\n   - \\( 150 \\times 1.05 = 157.5 \\)\n   - Adding 5 gives us \\( 157.5 + 5 = 162.5 \\)\n   - So, the temperature for `sensor_value = 150` is 162.5.\n\n4. **Compare the two temperatures:**\n   - Temperature at `sensor_value = 110` is 120.5.\n   - Temperature at `sensor_value = 150` is 162.5.\n   - Clearly, 162.5 is higher than 120.5.\n\nTherefore, the adjusted temperature at `sensor_value = 150` is indeed higher than the temperature at `sensor_value = 110`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. First, let's understand the function `update_temperature(sensor_reading, adjustment_factor=1.05)`:\n   - If `sensor_reading` is greater than 100, it calculates `(sensor_reading * adjustment_factor) + 5`.\n   - If `sensor_reading` is between 50 and 100 (inclusive), it calculates `sensor_reading * adjustment_factor`.\n   - Otherwise, it calculates `sensor_reading - 10`.\n\n2.
