    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial temperature is set to 20 when the `Experiment` object `exp` is created.\n2. The `increase_temperature` method is called with an increment of 40:\n   - The new temperature becomes 20 + 40 = 60.\n   - Since 60 is greater than 50 but not greater than 100, the system status is set to 'warning'.\n3. The `decrease_temperature` method is then called with a decrement of 15:\n   - The new temperature becomes 60 - 15 = 45.\n   - Since 45 is not less than 30, the system status remains 'warning'.\n4. The temperature is now enforced to remain at 60 by external means.\n\nGiven that the temperature is enforced to stay at 60, it does not go above 100 or below 50. Therefore, the system status will remain 'warning' because the temperature is still greater than 50.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"} - the system status will indeed be 'warning' if the temperature is enforced to remain at 60.",
    "Let's break down the steps to reason through this:\n\n1. **Initial Temperature**: The experiment starts with an initial temperature of 20.\n\n2. **Increase Temperature**: \n   - We call `increase_temperature(40)`.\n   - This increases the temperature from 20 to 60.\n   - Since 60 is greater than 50, the system status changes to 'warning'.\n\n3. **Decrease Temperature**:\n   - We then call `decrease_temperature(15)`.\n   - This decreases the temperature from 60 to 45.\n   - Since 45 is not less than 30, the system status remains 'warning'.\n\n4. **Enforcing Temperature to 60**:\n   - If we enforce the temperature to remain at 60, the temperature does not change.\n   - Therefore, the system status remains 'warning' because it was already set to 'warning' when the temperature was increased to 60.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the system status would indeed be 'warning' if we enforce the temperature to remain at 60.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
