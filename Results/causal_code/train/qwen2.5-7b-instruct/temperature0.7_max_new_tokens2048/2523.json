  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "The increaseTemp method increases the temperature by the provided increment. However, since the starting temperature is 0, increasing it by 50 results in a temperature of 50, which is below the alarm threshold of 100.",
  "causal_map": "increaseTemp → alarm; temperature → alarm",
  "causal_map_integration": "increasing the temperature by 50 will cause the alarm to be triggered because the temperature exceeds 100, directly causing the alarm to become true.",
