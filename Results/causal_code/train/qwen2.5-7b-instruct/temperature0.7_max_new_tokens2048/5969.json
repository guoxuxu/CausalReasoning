    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a `Vehicle` class defined with methods for setting the fuel type and starting the engine.\n2.

An instance of `Vehicle` named `car` is created with the type 'Car'.\n4. The fuel type is then set to 'diesel' using `car.setFuelType('diesel')`.\n5.
