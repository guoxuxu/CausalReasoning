If the season is not 'high', the increase is still present but less pronounced (1.0).\n- **Advertising Impact**: The advertising threshold (20) does not depend on `demand_increment`. Therefore, unless the current `demand` already exceeds 20 after the initial calculation, increasing `demand_increment` will not trigger the additional 20% increase from advertising.\n\nGiven these points, an increase in `demand_increment` will directly lead to an increase in the initial demand, which in turn will result in an increase in sales, assuming the `price` remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_sales` calculates the sales based on several factors including price, demand increment, advertising, and season.\n\n2.

However, we need to consider the interaction with the `advertising` parameter:\n   - If `advertising > 20`, then `demand` is further multiplied by 1.2.\n   - This means that for high levels of advertising, the effect of `demand_increment` on `sales` is amplified.\n\n4. Since the question specifies that no other parameters are changed, we can focus solely on the relationship between `demand_increment` and `sales`.\n\n5.
