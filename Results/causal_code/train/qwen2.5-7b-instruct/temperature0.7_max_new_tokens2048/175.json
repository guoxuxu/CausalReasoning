    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `make_coffee` method checks if there is enough water (`water_level >= water_used`) to make coffee.\n2. If there is enough water, it subtracts the used water from the current water level and returns \"Coffee Made\".\n3. If there isn't enough water, it returns \"Add Water\".\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we get the \"Add Water\" message and then add water using the `add_water` method:\n\n4. When we receive the \"Add Water\" message, it means that the current water level is insufficient for making coffee.\n5. We then call the `add_water` method with a certain amount of water.\n6. This increases the water level by the specified amount.\n7. After adding water, if the new water level is now greater than or equal to the amount needed to make coffee (`water_used`), the next call to `make_coffee` should succeed.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the subsequent attempt to make coffee after adding water should indeed be successful as long as the added water is sufficient to meet the `water_used` requirement.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

This increases the `water_level`.\n\n4. **Subsequent Attempt**: After adding water, we attempt to make coffee again using the `make_coffee` method. At this point, the `water_level` should now be sufficient (assuming we added enough water).\n\n5. **Outcome Check**: Since the `water_level` is now higher than what was needed to make coffee, the condition `self.water_level >= water_used` in the `make_coffee` method will evaluate to True, allowing the coffee to be made successfully.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
