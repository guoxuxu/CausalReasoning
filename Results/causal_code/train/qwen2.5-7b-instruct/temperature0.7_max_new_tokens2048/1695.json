    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The `updateExercise` method is defined in the `HealthReport` class.\n2. This method takes one parameter: `bool didExercise`.\n3. Inside the method, it first sets the `exercise` property to the value of `didExercise`.\n4. Then, it checks if `didExercise` is true using an `if` statement.\n5. If `didExercise` is true, it subtracts 100 from the `calories` property.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition under which the `calories` would decrease:\n\n- The method only decreases `calories` if `didExercise` is true.\n- The question asks specifically about the scenario where `updateExercise` is called with `true`.\n\nGiven that:\n- When `updateExercise` is called with `true`, the `if` statement inside the method will execute.\n- Executing the `if` statement results in `calories` being decreased by 100.\n\nTherefore, if `updateExercise` is called with `true`, there will necessarily be a decrease in the calorie count.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If `didExercise` is `true`, it subtracts 100 from `calories`.\n\nGiven that the question asks specifically about the scenario where `updateExercise` is called with `true`:\n\n- When `updateExercise(true)` is called, the condition `if (didExercise)` will evaluate to `true`.\n- As a result of this true condition, the line `calories -= 100;` will execute.\n\nTherefore, there will necessarily be a decrease in the calorie count when `updateExercise` is called with `true`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
