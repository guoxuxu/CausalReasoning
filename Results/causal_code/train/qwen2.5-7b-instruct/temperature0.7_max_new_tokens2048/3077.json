    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **predict_future_sales() Method**:\n   - This method calculates the future sales projection based on the current units sold in a specific month.\n   - It multiplies the current units by 1.1 to project a 10% increase.\n\n2. **update_sales() Method**:\n   - This method updates the units sold for a specific product.\n   - If `update_sales()` is called with additional units, it increases the units for that product in the `sales_data`.\n\n3. **Impact of update_sales() on predict_future_sales()**:\n   - The `predict_future_sales()` method only considers the current units sold in a given month.\n   - If `update_sales()` is called with additional units, those units would be reflected in the current units count for that month when `predict_future_sales()` is called.\n   - Therefore, if there is an unexpected increase in the sales projection, it could imply that `update_sales()` was called with additional units for a product in the relevant month.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - An unexpected increase in the sales projection from `predict_future_sales()` could indeed imply that `update_sales()` was called with additional units, as this would directly affect the current units count for the relevant month.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
