  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Adding a heat wave to 25 degrees increases temperature to 30 degrees; setting humidity to 95 triggers the temperature to decrease by 2 degrees due to the humidity adjustment rule. Hence, the temperature falls to 28 degrees, resulting in mild weather according to the report conditions.",
  "causal_map": "increase → temperature; rain → humidity; rain → temperature; humidity → temperature; heat_wave → temperature; adjust_humidity → temperature; temperature → report",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in temperature can be caused by a heat wave. Rain can increase humidity and decrease temperature. Adjusting humidity can also decrease temperature. Temperature determines the weather report.",

Since the amount of rain is more than 20, the temperature decreases by 1 degree, making it 34 degrees.\n   - `simulator.adjust_humidity(35)`: The humidity increases by 35%, making it 100%. Since the humidity exceeds 80%, the temperature decreases by 2 degrees, making it 32 degrees.\n\n3. **Intervention**:\n   - We set the humidity to 95% without any further adjustments.\n\n4. **Heat Wave**:\n   - `simulator.heat_wave(5)`: The temperature increases by 5 degrees, making it 37 degrees.\n\n5. **Report**:\n   - The `report` method checks the temperature:\n     - If temperature > 30, return \"hot\".\n     - If temperature < 10, return \"cold\".\n     - Otherwise, return \"mild\".\n\nGiven that the final temperature after all these actions is 37 degrees, which is greater than 30, the report will be \"hot\".\n\nTherefore, setting the humidity to 95% and then experiencing a heat wave of 5 degrees will not cause the weather report to stay 'mild'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
