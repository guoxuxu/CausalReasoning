  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",

  "Explanation": "Given that both scores are neither exceptionally high nor below 60, the condition for being 'average' holds as other conditions leading to 'high' or 'low' are not met.",

Otherwise, if their math score is above 90 and their science score is above 85, they are classified as high. Any other combination leads to a low classification.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `classify_student(scores)` takes a dictionary of scores as input.\n2.
