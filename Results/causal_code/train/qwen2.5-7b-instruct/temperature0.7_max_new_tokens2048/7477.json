    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `computeDiscount` method takes two parameters:\n   - `originalPrice`: the price of the item before any discounts.\n   - `isMember`: a boolean indicating whether the customer is a member.\n\n2. If `isMember` is true, the method checks if the customer is a member:\n   - If they are a member (`isMember == true`), it returns `originalPrice * discountRate`.\n   - The `discountRate` is set to 0.2 (or 20%) in the class definition.\n\n3. Since `discountRate` is not zero, multiplying `originalPrice` by `discountRate` will always result in a non-zero value as long as `originalPrice` is not zero.\n\n4. There is no condition within the `computeDiscount` method that would cause it to return zero if `isMember` is true.\n\nTherefore, if `isMember` is set to true, the `computeDiscount` method will return a non-zero value as long as `originalPrice` is not zero.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the `computeDiscount` Method**:\n   - The method takes two parameters: `originalPrice` and `isMember`.\n   - If `isMember` is true, it directly applies the discount rate (`discountRate`) to the `originalPrice`.\n   - If `isMember` is false, it checks if `firstTimeCustomer` is true. If so, it applies half of the discount rate to the `originalPrice`.\n   - If neither condition is met, it returns 0.\n\n2. **Given Condition**:\n   - We are asked about the case where `isMember` is set to true.\n   \n3. **Analyzing the Scenario**:\n   - When `isMember` is true, the method directly calculates the discounted price as `originalPrice * discountRate`.\n   - Since `discountRate` is set to 0.2 (which is a positive value), multiplying any positive `originalPrice` with 0.2 will result in a non-zero value.\n   - There is no need to check the `firstTimeCustomer` condition because `isMember` being true overrides it.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, when `isMember` is true, the `computeDiscount` method will always return a non-zero value.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `computeDiscount` method step by step:\n\n1. **Input Parameters**:\n   - `originalPrice`: The price of the item.\n   - `isMember`: A boolean indicating whether the customer is a member.\n\n2. **Method Logic**:\n   - If `isMember` is `true`, the method returns `originalPrice * discountRate`.\n   - If `isMember` is `false`, it checks the `firstTimeCustomer` flag.\n     - If `firstTimeCustomer` is `true`, it returns `originalPrice * (discountRate / 2)`.\n     - If `firstTimeCustomer` is `false`, it returns `0`.\n\n3. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if the `computeDiscount` method will return a non-zero value when `isMember` is set to `true`.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `isMember → computeDiscount returns non-zero value`: This relationship is directly given in the problem statement.\n   - `firstTimeCustomer → computeDiscount returns non-zero value`: This is not relevant for the scenario where `isMember` is `true`.\n\n5. **Reasoning**:\n   - When `isMember` is `true`, the method explicitly returns `originalPrice * discountRate`.\n   - Since `discountRate` is set to `0.2` (a positive value), and `originalPrice` is assumed to be a positive value, the product `originalPrice * discountRate` will always be a non-zero value.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the `computeDiscount` method will indeed return a non-zero value when `isMember` is set to `true`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `computeDiscount` method step by step:\n\n1. The method takes three parameters:\n   - `originalPrice`: the price of the item.\n   - `isMember`: a boolean indicating whether the customer is a member.\n   - `firstTimeCustomer`: a boolean indicating whether the customer is a first-time customer.\n\n2. The method checks if `isMember` is true:\n   - If `isMember` is true, it returns `originalPrice * discountRate`.\n     - Here, `discountRate` is set to 0.2, so the method returns `originalPrice * 0.2`.\n\n3. If `isMember` is not true, it checks if `firstTimeCustomer` is true:\n   - If `firstTimeCustomer` is true, it returns `originalPrice * (discountRate / 2)`.\n     - Since `discountRate` is 0.2, `(discountRate / 2)` is `0.1`, so the method returns `originalPrice * 0.1`.\n\n4. If neither `isMember` nor `firstTimeCustomer` is true, the method returns 0.\n\nGiven the problem statement, we need to determine if `isMember` being set to true will result in a non-zero value from the `computeDiscount` method.\n\n- When `isMember` is true, the method directly returns `originalPrice * 0.2`. Since `0.2` is a positive number, this will always result in a non-zero value as long as `originalPrice` is not zero.\n\nTherefore, setting `isMember` to true will indeed make the `computeDiscount` method return a non-zero value.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `computeDiscount` method has two main conditions:\n   - If `isMember` is true, it returns `originalPrice * discountRate`.\n   - If `isMember` is false and `firstTimeCustomer` is true, it returns `originalPrice * (discountRate / 2)`.\n\n2. We need to determine if setting `isMember` to true will result in a non-zero return value from `computeDiscount`.\n\n3. When `isMember` is true:\n   - The method directly computes and returns `originalPrice * discountRate`.\n   - Since `discountRate` is defined as 0.2, which is a positive value, and `originalPrice` is assumed to be a positive value (as prices are typically positive), the multiplication will yield a positive value.\n\n4. There is no scenario where `isMember` being true would cause the method to return zero or a negative value.\n\n5. Therefore, when `isMember` is true, the `computeDiscount` method will always return a non-zero value.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
