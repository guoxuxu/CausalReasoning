    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Normalization Process**:\n   - The `normalize_data` function calculates the mean of the input data.\n   - It then subtracts this mean from each element in the data list to center it around zero.\n\n2. **Impact on Median**:\n   - Normalizing the data by subtracting the mean does not change the order of the elements.\n   - For an odd number of elements, the median is the middle value when the data is sorted.\n   - For an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values when the data is sorted.\n   - Subtracting the same value (the mean) from each element does not change their relative ordering.\n\n3. **Analysis Process**:\n   - The `analyze_data` function sorts the data and finds the median.\n   - Since the relative order of the elements remains unchanged after normalization, the median value will also remain the same.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the normalized data has a zero mean, the original data and the normalized data will have the same relative ordering of elements.\n   - Therefore, the median calculated from the normalized data will be the same as the median calculated from the original data.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
