  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Receiving a reward ('coupon') indicates that the user is active. Although active status typically results from logging in more than 10 times as per the code, there could hypothetically be other unshown conditions or external modifications (interventions) to 'active' status outside this code snippet. Therefore, causality cannot be confirmed solely based on the reward without examining direct evidence of login counts",
