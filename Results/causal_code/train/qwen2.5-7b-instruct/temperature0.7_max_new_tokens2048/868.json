  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The increase_temperature method is called twice, adding 10 degrees (2 * 5 degrees) to the initial temperature of 50 degrees, making it 60 degrees. Though evaporation is checked when temperature reaches 100 degrees, the temperature only rises to 60 degrees, which is insufficient to cause evaporation. The initial interpretation is incorrect; evaporation does not occur. Correct Answer: No",
  "causal_map": "temperature → evaporation; temperature → condensation",
  "causal_map_integration": "Temperature directly influences both evaporation and condensation. An increase in temperature leads to evaporation when it reaches 100 degrees Celsius, while a decrease leads to condensation when it drops to 0 degrees Celsius.",

    "Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Temperature**: The initial temperature is set to 50 degrees Celsius.\n\n2. **First Increase**:\n   - The `increase_temperature` method is called.\n   - This increases the temperature by 5 degrees, making it 55 degrees Celsius.\n   - The `check_evaporation` method is then called.\n   - Since 55 is less than 100, `evaporation` is set to `False`.\n\n3. **Second Increase**:\n   - The `increase_temperature` method is called again.\n   - This increases the temperature by another 5 degrees, making it 60 degrees Celsius.\n   - The `check_evaporation` method is then called.\n   - Since 60 is less than 100, `evaporation` is still set to `False`.\n\n4. **Decrease**:\n   - The `decrease_temperature` method is called.\n   - This decreases the temperature by 5 degrees, making it 55 degrees Celsius.\n   - The `check_condensation` method is then called.\n   - Since 55 is greater than 0, `condensation` is set to `False`.\n\nAfter these operations, the temperature has been increased twice from 50 to 60 degrees Celsius and then decreased back to 55 degrees Celsius.
