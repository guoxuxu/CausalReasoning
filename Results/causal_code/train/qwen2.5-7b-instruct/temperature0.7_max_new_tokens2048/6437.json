  "Explanation": "Doubling each number in the data list will double the total sum, and since the number of elements remains the same, the average will also double. As the original average with the given data list is 30 (which is 'Above Average'), doubling it will result in an average of 60, also 'Above Average'.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Data List**: The original data list is `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.\n2. **Original Calculation**:\n   - Total: \\(10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150\\)\n   - Average: \\(150 / 5 = 30\\)\n3. **Output Based on Original Calculation**:\n   - Since the average is `30`, which is greater than `25`, the output would be `'Above Average'`.\n\nNow, let's consider the modified code where each number in the data list is doubled before calculating the total and average.\n\n4. **Modified Data List**: Doubling each number in the original list gives `[20, 40, 60, 80, 100]`.\n5. **Modified Calculation**:\n   - Total: \\(20 + 40 + 60 + 80 + 100 = 300\\)\n   - Average: \\(300 / 5 = 60\\)\n6. **Output Based on Modified Calculation**:\n   - Since the average is now `60`, which is also greater than `25`, the output would still be `'Above Average'`.\n\nTherefore, even if we double each number in the data list before calculating the total and average, the output will still be `'Above Average'` for the original data list.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's calculate the original average of the data list:\n   - Data list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n   - Sum: 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150\n   - Length: 5\n   - Original average: 150 / 5 = 30\n\n2. The condition checks if the average is greater than 25:\n   - Since 30 > 25, the output would be 'Above Average'.\n\n3. Now, let's consider doubling each number in the data list:\n   - New data list: [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]\n   - Sum: 20 + 40 + 60 + 80 + 100 = 300\n   - Length remains the same: 5\n   - New average: 300 / 5 = 60\n\n4. Check the new condition with the doubled data:\n   - Since 60 > 25, the output would still be 'Above Average'.\n\n5. Conclusion: Doubling each number in the data list increases both the total and the average proportionally, so the condition for being 'Above Average' (average > 25) would still be met.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
