    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - The `OrderProcessor` class has two key properties: `discountRate` and `isPremiumMember`.\n   - The constructor sets `isPremiumMember` based on the input parameter.\n   - If `isPremiumMember` is true, `discountRate` is set to 20; otherwise, it is set to 5.\n\n2. **Processing an Order:**\n   - The `processOrder` method calculates the final price after applying a discount if `applyDiscount` is true.\n   - The discount is calculated as `(orderValue * discountRate / 100)`.\n\n3. **Scenario Analysis:**\n   - **Scenario 1 (isPremiumMember is true):**\n     - `discountRate` = 20\n     - Final Price = `orderValue - (orderValue * 20 / 100)`\n     - Simplified: `Final Price = orderValue - 0.2 * orderValue = 0.8 * orderValue`\n\n   - **Scenario 2 (isPremiumMember is false):**\n     - `discountRate` = 5\n     - Final Price = `orderValue - (orderValue * 5 / 100)`\n     - Simplified: `Final Price = orderValue - 0.05 * orderValue = 0.95 * orderValue`\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - In Scenario 1, the final price is 80% of the original order value.\n   - In Scenario 2, the final price is 95% of the original order value.\n   - Since 80% (Scenario 1) is less than 95% (Scenario 2), the final price will indeed be lower when `isPremiumMember` is true compared to when it is false, given the same `orderValue` and `applyDiscount` set to true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
