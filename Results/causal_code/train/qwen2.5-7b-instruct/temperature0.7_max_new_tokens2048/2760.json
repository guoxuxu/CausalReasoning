  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "By intervening and explicitly setting the activity to 'watch movies', the function `prepare_items()` subsequently selects 'popcorn' and 'soft drinks' as the necessary items. This demonstrates direct causation from the stipulated cause (activity choice) to the effect (items prepared) with an intervention altering the activity.",
  "causal_map": "decide_on_activity → activity; activity → necessary_items",
  "causal_map_integration": "decide_on_activity directly determines the activity, which then directly influences the necessary_items.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Weather Condition**: The `weather_condition` function randomly selects one of three possible weather conditions: sunny, rainy, or cloudy.\n\n2. **Decide on Activity**: The `decide_on_activity` function takes the weather as input and decides on an activity based on the weather condition:\n   - If the weather is sunny, the activity is set to 'go to the park'.\n   - If the weather is rainy, the activity is set to 'watch movies'.\n   - Otherwise (if it's cloudy), the activity is set to 'visit a museum'.\n\n3. **Prepare Items**: The `prepare_items` function takes the activity as input and returns a list of necessary items:\n   - For 'go to the park', the necessary items are ['sunscreen', 'frisbee'].\n   - For 'watch movies', the necessary items are ['popcorn', 'soft drinks'].\n   - For 'visit a museum', the necessary items are ['camera', 'guide book'].\n\n4. **Intervention**: An intervention sets the activity directly to 'watch movies'.
