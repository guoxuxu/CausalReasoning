  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Setting 'diet' to 0 effectively removes the diet's contribution (0.5 * diet) to 'energy_level'. As a result, 'energy_level' becomes dependent solely on the values of 'treatment' and 'age'. The code suggests a direct linear dependence on these two variables.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_effects` calculates three outputs: `health`, `energy_level`, and `stress_level`.\n\n2.

If we set 'diet' to 0, the formula simplifies to:\n   `energy_level = 0.3 * treatment + 0.4 * age`\n\n4.
