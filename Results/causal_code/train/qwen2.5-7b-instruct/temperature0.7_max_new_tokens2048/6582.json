    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_scores` calculates the average score of a team.\n2.

Initially, the scores are [45, 55, 60]. The average is (45 + 55 + 60) / 3 = 52.33, which is already above 50.\n5.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_scores` calculates the average score of the team based on the scores provided in the input dictionary.\n\n2.
