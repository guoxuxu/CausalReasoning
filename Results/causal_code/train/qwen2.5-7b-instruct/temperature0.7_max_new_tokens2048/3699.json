    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The inventory system has a `min_threshold` for each item, which is set to 10 for apples.\n2. When an order is placed for an item, the stock for that item decreases.\n3. If the stock of an item falls below its `min_threshold`, a restock action is triggered.\n4. The restock action adds 100 units to the stock.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where apples have been restocked:\n\n- For the restock to be triggered, the stock of apples must have fallen below the `min_threshold` of 10.\n- However, we don't know how much the stock was reduced by the last order or orders before the restock.\n- It's possible that the stock was reduced to 9 or 8 and then restocked to 109, or it could have been reduced to 1 and then restocked to 101.\n- Therefore, just because apples were restocked, we cannot definitively infer that the stock was exactly below 10 (i.e., less than or equal to 9) before restocking.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `InventorySystem` class has a method `order_item` which decreases the stock of an item when an order is placed.\n2. If the stock of an item falls below its minimum threshold after an order, the `restock_item` method is called.\n3. The minimum threshold for apples is set to 10.\n4. The `restock_item` method increases the stock of the specified item by 100.\n\nGiven that apples have been restocked, we need to determine if the stock was below 10 before restocking.\n\n5. For restocking to occur, the stock must have fallen below the minimum threshold (which is 10 for apples).\n6. Therefore, immediately before the restock, the stock level of apples must have been less than 10.\n\nSince the restock happened because the stock was below the threshold, we can infer that the stock was indeed below 10 before restocking.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The minimum threshold for apples is set to 10 units (`self.min_threshold['apple'] = 10`).\n4. For restocking to occur, the stock must be below this minimum threshold after an order is placed.\n\nGiven these points, if we observe that apples have been restocked, it means the stock of apples was indeed below 10 units at some point before the restock occurred.
