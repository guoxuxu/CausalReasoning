  "Explanation": "The 'process_data' function checks each item in the input list to see if it is even (datum % 2 == 0). It only appends the datum multiplied by 2 to the 'processed' list if this condition is true. Providing only odd numbers means this condition is never met, hence the result will be an empty list.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a list of numbers as input.\n2. It initializes an empty list `processed`.\n3. It iterates over each element `datum` in the input list.\n4. For each `datum`, it checks if the number is even (i.e., `datum % 2 == 0`).\n5. If the number is even, it appends `datum * 2` to the `processed` list.\n6. If the number is odd, nothing happens, and the loop continues.\n\nNow, let's consider what would happen if we provide a list of only odd numbers:\n\n- An example list of all odd numbers: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`\n- For each odd number, `datum % 2` will be 1 (not equal to 0), so the condition `if datum % 2 == 0:` will always be false.\n- As a result, none of the numbers will be added to the `processed` list.\n\nTherefore, if we provide a list of only odd numbers to the function, the `processed` list will indeed remain empty.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
