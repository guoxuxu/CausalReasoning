    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` checks if 'price' is in the data dictionary and if its value is greater than 100.\n2. If both conditions are true, it sets `data['category']` to 'High'.\n3. If either condition is false, it sets `data['category']` to 'Low'.\n\nThe question specifically asks if 'category' will always be set to 'High' when 'price' is greater than 100.\n\nGiven the logic of the function:\n- If 'price' is indeed greater than 100, the first `if` statement will execute, setting `data['category']` to 'High'.\n- This directly implies that if 'price' is greater than 100, 'category' will be set to 'High'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
