    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `checkSystemHealth` method checks if either the CPU is overloaded (`isCpuOverloaded`) or the memory is full (`isMemoryFull`).\n\n2. If either condition is true, it calls the `sendNotification()` method.\n\n3. The `sendNotification` method simply sets `notificationSent` to true.\n\n4. The conditions for sending a notification are:\n   - Either the CPU is overloaded (true)\n   - Or the memory is full (true)\n\n5. This means that a notification can be sent if:\n   - Only the CPU is overloaded\n   - Only the memory is full\n   - Both the CPU and memory are overloaded\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude that both CPU is overloaded and memory is full just because a notification was sent. A notification could have been sent due to either one of these conditions being true.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

This means that a notification can be sent even if only one of these conditions is true.\n4.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `SystemHealthChecker` class has three private boolean variables:\n   - `isCpuOverloaded`\n   - `isMemoryFull`\n   - `notificationSent`\n\n2. The constructor initializes these variables based on the provided status of CPU and memory.\n\n3.

However, the conditions are ORed together, not ANDed. This means that if only the CPU is overloaded, or only the memory is full, or both, a notification will still be sent.\n\n8.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the conditions for sending a notification**:\n   - The `checkSystemHealth` method sends a notification if either `isCpuOverloaded` or `isMemoryFull` is `true`.\n\n2. **Analyze the logical structure**:\n   - The logical operation used here is an OR (`||`). This means that if either condition is met, a notification will be sent.\n\n3. **Consider the possible scenarios**:\n   - Scenario 1: Only `isCpuOverloaded` is `true`. In this case, a notification will be sent.\n   - Scenario 2: Only `isMemoryFull` is `true`. In this case, a notification will also be sent.\n   - Scenario 3: Both `isCpuOverloaded` and `isMemoryFull` are `true`. In this case, a notification will definitely be sent.\n   - Scenario 4: Neither `isCpuOverloaded` nor `isMemoryFull` is `true`. In this case, no notification will be sent.\n\n4. **Determine the conclusion**:\n   - From the above scenarios, we can see that a notification being sent does not necessarily mean that both `isCpuOverloaded` and `isMemoryFull` are `true`. It could be due to just one of them being `true`.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot conclude that both CPU is overloaded and memory is full if a notification is sent.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

If either condition is true, it calls `sendNotification()`.\n   - The `sendNotification` method sets `notificationSent` to true.\n   - The `isNotificationSent` method returns the current state of `notificationSent`.\n\n2. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `isCpuOverloaded` → `notificationSent`: If the CPU is overloaded, a notification will be sent.\n   - `isMemoryFull` → `notificationSent`: If the memory is full, a notification will be sent.\n\n3. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if a notification being sent implies that both `isCpuOverloaded` and `isMemoryFull` are true.\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - A notification is sent if either `isCpuOverloaded` or `isMemoryFull` is true (or both).\n   - Therefore, if a notification is sent, it could be due to just one of the conditions being true, or both being true.\n   - It is not necessary for both conditions to be true for a notification to be sent.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the given causal relationships, we cannot conclude that both `isCpuOverloaded` and `isMemoryFull` must be true if a notification is sent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

This means that a notification will be sent if either of these two conditions is true, or both.\n\n3. **Analyze the question:**\n   - We need to determine if a notification being sent implies that both `isCpuOverloaded` and `isMemoryFull` must be `true`.\n\n4. **Evaluate the implications:**\n   - If a notification is sent, it could be because:\n     - Only `isCpuOverloaded` is `true`.\n     - Only `isMemoryFull` is `true`.\n     - Both `isCpuOverloaded` and `isMemoryFull` are `true`.\n   - In all these cases, a notification is sent, but not necessarily because both conditions are true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - A notification being sent does not guarantee that both `isCpuOverloaded` and `isMemoryFull` are `true`.
