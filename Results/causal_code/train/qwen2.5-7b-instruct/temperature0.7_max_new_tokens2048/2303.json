    "Let's break down the logic of the `weather_impact` function to determine if it will definitely return 'snowy' when the weather is 'rainy' and the season is 'winter'.\n\n1. The function has multiple conditions that need to be checked.\n2. The first condition checks if the weather is 'rainy' and the season is 'winter'. If both conditions are true, it returns 'snowy'.\n3. The second condition checks if the weather is 'sunny' and the season is 'summer'. If this condition is true, it returns 'hot'.\n4. The third condition uses an 'or' statement. It checks if the weather is 'cloudy' OR if the weather is 'rainy' and the season is 'summer'. If either part of the 'or' statement is true, it returns 'cool'.\n5. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'mild'.\n\nGiven the specific case where the weather is 'rainy' and the season is 'winter':\n- This directly matches the first condition of the function.\n- Since the first condition is met (weather is 'rainy' and season is 'winter'), the function will return 'snowy' without evaluating any other conditions.\n\nTherefore, the function will definitely return 'snowy' under these conditions.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `weather_impact` takes two parameters: `weather` and `season`.\n\n2. We are given that the `weather` is 'rainy' and the `season` is 'winter'.\n\n3. Looking at the first condition in the function:\n   - If `weather == 'rainy'` and `season == 'winter'`, it will return 'snowy'.\n   \n4. Since the condition `weather == 'rainy' and season == 'winter'` matches exactly with what we are given (both 'rainy' and 'winter'), the function will execute this block of code.\n\n5. There are no other conditions that would override this return statement for the given inputs.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided logic and the given inputs, the function will definitely return 'snowy'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
