    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `startEngine` method:\n   - Checks if the engine is not running (`!engineRunning`).\n   - If it's not running, it sets `engineRunning` to true and initializes `speed` to 0.\n\n2. The `accelerate` method:\n   - Only increases the speed if the engine is running and the increment is positive.\n   - It adds the specified increment to the current speed.\n\n3. The `stopEngine` method:\n   - Checks if the engine is running (`engineRunning`).\n   - If it is running, it sets `engineRunning` to false and resets `speed` to 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence of events:\n\n- We call `startEngine()`. This sets `engineRunning` to true and `speed` to 0.\n- We then call `accelerate(int increment)` with a positive value. Since the engine is running, the speed will be increased by the specified increment.\n- Finally, we call `stopEngine()`.\n\nWhen `stopEngine()` is called, it will see that the engine is running (`engineRunning` is true), so it will set `engineRunning` to false and reset `speed` to 0.\n\nTherefore, the speed will indeed be reverted to zero after calling `stopEngine()`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Analysis:\n   - When `stopEngine` is called, the last check is whether `engineRunning` is true.\n   - Since we just called `accelerate` with a positive increment, `engineRunning` remains true.\n   - Therefore, `stopEngine` will set `speed` to 0.\n\nBased on this reasoning, calling `stopEngine` after `startEngine` and then `accelerate` will indeed revert the speed to zero.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
