  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The method turnOnSignals checks if the current time is either after 6 pm or before 6 am to determine if it is nighttime. Since 20 (8 pm) is after 6 pm, isNight will be true, leading to the activation of street lights.",
  "causal_map": "time > 18 → isNight; isNight → activateStreetLights; activateStreetLights → 'Street lights activated.'",
  "causal_map_integration": "When the time is greater than 18, isNight becomes true, which then triggers the activation of street lights.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `turnOnSignals` method takes an integer `time` as its parameter.\n2. Inside the method, we check if it's night time using the condition `(time > 18 || time < 6)`.\n3. We need to determine if the time parameter (20) satisfies this condition:\n   - `20 > 18` evaluates to true.\n   - `20 < 6` evaluates to false.\n4. Since one part of the OR condition is true (`20 > 18`), the overall condition `(time > 18 || time < 6)` evaluates to true.\n5. When the condition is true, the method `activateStreetLights()` is called.\n\nGiven that the condition is met with a time of 20, the street lights will indeed be activated.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
