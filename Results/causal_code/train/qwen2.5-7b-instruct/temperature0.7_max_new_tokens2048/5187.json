  "causal_map": "isPowerOn → temperature; isPowerOn → isWaterBoiling",
  "causal_map_integration": "Turning the WaterBoiler on without calling heatWater() will not change the temperature from its initial room temperature of 20, as long as it remains on and the temperature does not naturally cool down below 20 due to external factors.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial state of the WaterBoiler:\n   - `isPowerOn` is false\n   - `temperature` is 20\n\n2. Turning it on:\n   - `turnOn()` method is called\n   - This sets `isPowerOn` to true\n   - No change to `temperature`\n\n3. Not calling `heatWater()`:\n   - `heatWater()` increases the temperature by 5 if `isPowerOn` is true\n   - Since `isPowerOn` is now true but `heatWater()` is not called, the temperature does not increase\n\n4. Final state after turning on but without heating:\n   - `isPowerOn` is true\n   - `temperature` remains 20\n\nTherefore, the temperature would remain the same.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The `heatWater()` method increases the temperature by 5 only if `isPowerOn` is true. Since we have not called `heatWater()`, the temperature does not change.\n\n4. The `coolDown()` method reduces the temperature by 3 only if `isPowerOn` is false AND the temperature is greater than 20.
