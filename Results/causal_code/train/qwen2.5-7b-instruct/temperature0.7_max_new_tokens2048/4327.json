  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "If the temperature is initially 15 degrees and is increased by 20 degrees, it results in a temperature of 35 degrees. According to adjustWeather, if the temperature exceeds 30 degrees, isRaining is set to false, thus predicting sunny weather.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - Temperature starts at 15 degrees.\n   \n2. **Increase in Temperature**:\n   - The temperature is increased by 20 degrees.\n   - New temperature = 15 + 20 = 35 degrees.\n\n3. **Adjust Weather Method**:\n   - The `adjustWeather()` method is called when the temperature changes.\n   - The logic inside `adjustWeather()` checks if the new temperature is greater than 30 degrees.\n   - Since the new temperature is 35 degrees, which is greater than 30, the method sets `isRaining` to `false`.\n\n4. **Will It Rain Check**:\n   - The `willItRain()` method simply returns the value of `isRaining`.\n   - After adjusting the weather, `isRaining` is set to `false`, so `willItRain()` will return `false`.\n\n5. **Get Weather Status**:\n   - The `getWeatherStatus()` method checks if `isRaining` is `true`.\n   - Since `isRaining` is `false`, it returns \"Sunny\".\n\nGiven that the final state of `isRaining` is `false`, the system will predict sunny weather.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
