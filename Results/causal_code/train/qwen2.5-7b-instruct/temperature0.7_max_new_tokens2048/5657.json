    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have an `Environment` class with attributes for pollution and wildlife.\n2. The `increase_pollution` method in the `Environment` class increases pollution by a specified amount and reduces wildlife if pollution exceeds 80.\n3. We have a `Policy` class with an attribute for law enforcement status.\n4.

    "Let's break down the causal relationships and the steps involved:\n\n1. **Policy.law_enforcement → Environment.increase_pollution**: If the policy implements a strict environmental law (i.e., `law_enforcement` is True), then it will call `env.increase_pollution(-20)`.
