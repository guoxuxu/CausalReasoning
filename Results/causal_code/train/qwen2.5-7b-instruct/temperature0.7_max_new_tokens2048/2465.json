    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: We need to consider the initial conditions where someone is older than 30.\n2. **Current Policy**: Under the current policy, if a person is older than 30, their `risk_category` is set to 'high'. This results in a score bonus of 10 added to their `final_score`.\n3. **Proposed Policy Change**: The proposed policy changes the score bonus for those older than 30 from 10 to 7.\n4. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `data['age']` determines whether `data['risk_category']` is 'high' or 'low'.\n   - `data['risk_category']` then affects the `data['final_score']` through the addition of either 10 or 5.\n   - `data['score']` also contributes to the `data['final_score']`.\n\nGiven these relationships, let's analyze the impact of the policy change:\n\n- **Before the Policy Change**: For someone older than 30, the `final_score` would be increased by 10 (from the risk category 'high').\n- **After the Policy Change**: For someone older than 30, the `final_score` would now be increased by only 7 (due to the new risk category 'high').\n\nSince the increase in `final_score` due to the `risk_category` being 'high' is reduced from 10 to 7, the `final_score` for people older than 30 will indeed be lower under the new policy compared to the old policy, assuming all other conditions remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
