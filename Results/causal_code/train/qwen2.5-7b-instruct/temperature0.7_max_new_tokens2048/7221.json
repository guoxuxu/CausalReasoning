    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `CommunicationSystem` is initialized with `is_active` set to `True`.\n\n2. **Deactivation Method**: There is a method `deactivate_system` which sets `is_active` to `False` and also sets `has_unread_messages` to `False`.\n\n3. **Receive Message Method**: The `receive_message` method checks if `is_active` is `True`. If it is, the message is appended to the `messages` list and `has_unread_messages` is set to `True`.\n\n4. **Deactivation Impact**: When the system is deactivated using `deactivate_system`, `is_active` is set to `False`.\n\n5. **Message Reception After Deactivation**: If the system is deactivated, any call to `receive_message` will check if `is_active` is `True`. Since `is_active` is now `False`, the condition will not be met, and no messages will be appended to the `messages` list.\n\nTherefore, after deactivating the system, messages will not be stored in the system when received.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `CommunicationSystem` class has an attribute `is_active` which controls whether the system can receive and process messages.\n\n2. The `receive_message` method checks if `is_active` is `True` before adding a message to the `messages` list and setting `has_unread_messages` to `True`.\n\n3. The `deactivate_system` method sets `is_active` to `False` and also sets `has_unread_messages` to `False`.\n\n4. If the system is deactivated using `deactivate_system`, `is_active` becomes `False`.\n\n5. When trying to receive a message while the system is deactivated, the `receive_message` method will see that `is_active` is `False` and thus not add the message to the `messages` list.\n\n6. Since the `has_unread_messages` flag is set to `False` when the system is deactivated, it does not matter whether messages were attempted to be received while deactivated.\n\nTherefore, when the system is deactivated, no messages will be stored in the system when they are received.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Deactivation**: When `deactivate_system` is called on the `CommunicationSystem` object, the `is_active` attribute is set to `False`. This means that the system is no longer active.\n\n2. **Receiving Messages**: The method `receive_message` checks if `self.is_active` is `True` before adding a message to the `messages` list and setting `has_unread_messages` to `True`.\n\n3. **Deactivated System Behavior**: If the system is deactivated (i.e., `self.is_active` is `False`), then the `receive_message` method will not add any new messages to the `messages` list because the condition `if self.is_active:` will evaluate to `False`.\n\n4. **Storing Messages**: Since the condition in `receive_message` is not met when the system is deactivated, messages will not be stored in the system when they are received.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `CommunicationSystem` is initialized with `is_active` set to `True`.\n\n2. **Deactivation**: The method `deactivate_system()` is called on the system instance, setting `is_active` to `False`.\n\n3. **Message Reception**:\n   - When a message is received (`receive_message` is called), the check `if self.is_active:` is performed.\n   - If `is_active` is `False`, the message will not be appended to `messages` and `has_unread_messages` will not be set to `True`.\n\n4. **Storage of Messages**: Since the condition `if self.is_active:` fails when `is_active` is `False`, messages will not be stored in the system when it is deactivated.\n\nTherefore, when the system is deactivated, messages will not be stored in the system when received.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
