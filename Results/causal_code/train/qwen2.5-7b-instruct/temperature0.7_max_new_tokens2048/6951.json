    "Let's break down the logic of the `process_data` function to reason through this:\n\n1. The function first checks if the key 'age' exists in the input dictionary `data`.\n2. If 'age' exists, it checks if its value is greater than 18.\n   - If true, it sets `data['adult'] = True`.\n   - If false, it sets `data['adult'] = False`.\n\n3. Next, the function checks if both 'income' exists in the dictionary and `data['adult']` is `True`.\n4. If these conditions are met, it then checks the income value:\n   - If income > 30000, it sets `data['tax_bracket'] = 'high'`.\n   - Otherwise, it sets `data['tax_bracket'] = 'low'`.\n\nThe key point here is that for `data['tax_bracket']` to be set to 'high', two conditions must be satisfied:\n- The 'age' must be greater than 18 (to set `data['adult'] = True`).\n- The income must be greater than 30000.\n\nTherefore, if `data['tax_bracket']` is 'high', it is certain that the 'age' was greater than 18 because this is one of the required conditions for setting the tax bracket to 'high'.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
