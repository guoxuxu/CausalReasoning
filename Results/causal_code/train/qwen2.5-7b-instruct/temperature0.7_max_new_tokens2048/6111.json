  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "From the 'student_grades' function, increasing the hours_studied while maintaining attendance >75 (i.e., 80) retains the performance boost at 0.1. Since the original hours_studied already crossed the threshold for a study boost (i.e., 5 hours), increasing it further keeps the study boost unchanged at 0.2. Therefore, the final_grade calculation remains the same (no additional increases from the increase in hours beyond the threshold).",
  "causal_map": "hours_studied → performance_boost; class_attendance → performance_boost; hours_studied → study_boost; class_attendance → study_boost; performance_boost + study_boost → final_grade; current_grade → final_grade",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing hours studied from 6 to 8, while keeping class attendance constant, will definitively increase the final grade because it directly increases the study_boost, which in turn increases the final_grade.",
