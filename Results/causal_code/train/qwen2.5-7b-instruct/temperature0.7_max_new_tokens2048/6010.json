It is a constant input that defines which values are filtered out.\n- Raising the elements of `adjusted_data` does not affect the filtering process because it is a post-processing step.\n- The filtering is based solely on the initial `input_data` and the given `filter_threshold`.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Data and Filtering**:\n   - We start with `input_data = [15, 22, 18, 9, 5, 13]`.\n   - The `process_data` function filters out any values less than `filter_threshold` (which is 10 in this case).\n   - So, `filtered_data = [15, 22, 18]`.\n\n2. **Population Mean Calculation**:\n   - The population mean of `input_data` is calculated as `sum(data) / len(data)`, which is `(15 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 5 + 13) / 6 = 72 / 6 = 12`.\n   \n3. **Adjusted Data Calculation**:\n   - The adjusted data is then calculated as `[x - population_mean for x in filtered_data]`, resulting in `[15-12, 22-12, 18-12] = [3, 10, 6]`.\n\n4. **Manipulating `adjusted_data`**:\n   - If we manipulate `adjusted_data` by adding 2 units to each element, it becomes `[5, 12, 8]`.\n\n5. **Reversing Adjustments**:\n   - To understand the effect on `filtered_data`, we need to reverse the adjustment. Each value in `adjusted_data` was reduced by 12, so adding 2 back would mean subtracting 10 from the original filtered data.\n   - Thus, reversing the adjustment gives us `[15, 22, 18]` again.\n\n6. **Filter Threshold Consideration**:\n   - The `filter_threshold` remains unchanged at 10. Manipulating `adjusted_data` does not affect the threshold used for filtering.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is that manipulating `adjusted_data` to raise each element's value by 2 units will not result in an increase in the `filter_threshold`. The `filter_threshold` is a parameter set at the beginning of the function and is not affected by changes in `adjusted_data`.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
