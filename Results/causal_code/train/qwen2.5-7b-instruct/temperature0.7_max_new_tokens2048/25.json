The `update_coffee_access` method checks if the active project is in a list of allowed projects (`['Project X', 'Project Z']`).\n\n5. If the active project is in this list, it sets `coffee_access` to `True`. Otherwise, it sets `coffee_access` to `False`.\n\n6. We're specifically asked about a user assigned to 'Project Z'.\n\n7.

In `update_coffee_access`, there's a list of allowed projects (`allowed_projects`) which includes 'Project X' and 'Project Z'.\n\n4. If the user's current active project is in this list, their `coffee_access` is set to `True`. Otherwise, it remains `False`.\n\n5. The question asks specifically about a user being assigned to 'Project Z'.\n\n6. Since 'Project Z' is included in the `allowed_projects` list, when a user is assigned to 'Project Z', the condition `if self.active_project in allowed_projects:` will be true.\n\n7.

    "Let's break down the logic in the provided code to determine if a user assigned to 'Project Z' will automatically have access to the coffee machine.\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `OfficeUser` class is initialized with a name, an active project (which starts as `None`), and coffee access set to `False`.\n\n2. **Assigning a Project**: When `assign_project` is called with a specific project, it updates the `active_project` attribute of the user instance and calls the `update_coffee_access` method. It also logs the status change.\n\n3. **Updating Coffee Access**: The `update_coffee_access` method checks if the `active_project` is in the list `allowed_projects`.
