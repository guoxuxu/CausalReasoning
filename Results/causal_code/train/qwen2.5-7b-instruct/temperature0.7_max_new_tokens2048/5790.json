    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `resolve_issue` takes three parameters: `customer_satisfaction`, `response_time`, and `agent_expertise`.\n\n2.

The function calculates `customer_satisfaction` based on the values of `agent_expertise` and `response_time`, but it does not modify `agent_expertise` itself.\n\n4.
