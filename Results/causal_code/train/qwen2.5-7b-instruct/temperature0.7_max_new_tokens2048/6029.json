    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `produce_vehicle` method in the `VehicleFactory` class takes two parameters: `engine_type` and `with_gps`.\n\n2. The `max_speed` is determined based on the `engine_type`:\n   - If `engine_type` is 'electric', then `max_speed` is set to 120.\n   - Otherwise (if `engine_type` is not 'electric'), `max_speed` is set to 150.\n\n3. The `with_gps` parameter is used to determine whether the vehicle should have GPS, but it does not affect the `max_speed`.\n\n4. In the example provided, `car = factory.produce_vehicle('electric', True)`, the `engine_type` is 'electric' and `with_gps` is True.\n\n5. Since the `engine_type` is 'electric', the `max_speed` is set to 120 regardless of the value of `with_gps`.\n\n6.
