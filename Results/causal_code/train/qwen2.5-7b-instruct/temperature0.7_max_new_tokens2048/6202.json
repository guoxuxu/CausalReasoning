    "Let's break down the logic of the `classify_student` function:\n\n1. If both math and science scores meet specific thresholds (math > 90 and science > 85), the student is classified as 'high'.\n2. If either math or science scores fall below a threshold (math < 60 or science < 60), the student is classified as 'low'.\n3. Otherwise, the student is classified as 'average'.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where a student's classification changes to 'high' after an intervention that specifically boosts science scores.\n\nFor a student to be classified as 'high':\n- Their math score must be greater than 90.\n- Their science score must be greater than 85.\n\nIf a student was originally classified as 'average' or 'low' and then becomes 'high' due to the science intervention, it implies that their science score was not initially above 85 (since they needed to improve to become 'high').\n\nTherefore, the original science score was likely below 85.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

For a student to be classified as 'high':\n   - Their math score must be greater than 90.\n   - Their science score must be greater than 85.\n3. The question asks if, after implementing a policy to boost science scores, a student was originally classified as 'high'.\n4. If a student's classification changed to 'high' due to the policy, it means their science score increased to above 85.\n5. However, for them to have been classified as 'high' originally, both conditions (math > 90 and science > 85) would need to be met.\n6. If the student was not originally classified as 'high', at least one of these conditions was not met:\n   - Either their math score was not greater than 90, or\n   - Their science score was not greater than 85.\n\nGiven that their classification changed to 'high' after the policy, it implies that their original science score must have been below 85 (since it needed to increase to meet the requirement for the 'high' classification).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
