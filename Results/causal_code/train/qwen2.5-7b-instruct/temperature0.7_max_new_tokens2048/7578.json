    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_values` takes two inputs: `temp` (temperature) and `pressure`.\n\n2. It calculates the boiling point using the formula: \n   `boiling_point = 100 + (pressure - 1) * 0.5`\n\n3. Based on the comparison of `temp` with `boiling_point`, it assigns a state:\n   - If `temp > boiling_point`, the state is 'Gas'.\n   - If `temp == boiling_point`, the state is 'Transition'.\n   - Otherwise, the state is 'Liquid'.\n\n4.
