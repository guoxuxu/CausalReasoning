    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial temperature is set to 20.\n2. The heater_status is initially set to False.\n3. The first call to `increase_temperature(temperature, heater_status)` is made:\n   - Since `heater_on` (heater_status) is False, the condition `if heater_on:` is not met.\n   - Therefore, `env_temp` (which is the same as `temperature`) does not change.\n4. After this call, the temperature remains at 20.\n5. Next, heater_status is set to True.\n6. The second call to `increase_temperature(temperature, heater_status)` is made:\n   - Now that `heater_on` (heater_status) is True, the condition `if heater_on:` is met.\n   - As a result, `env_temp` (temperature) increases by 5.\n7. After this call, the temperature becomes 25.\n\nNow, we need to answer the question: If the heater_status remains False, will the temperature remain the same?\n\nSince we've established that the temperature only increases when heater_status is True, if heater_status remains False, the temperature will indeed remain the same.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
