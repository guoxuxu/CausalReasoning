    "Let's break down the logic of the `update_score` function step by step:\n\n1. The function takes three parameters: `score`, `points`, and `bonus`.\n2. If the `bonus` parameter is `True`, it multiplies `points` by 2.\n3. It then increments the score by the value of `points` (after applying the bonus if applicable).\n4. Finally, it returns the updated score.\n\nGiven that the function indeed duplicates `points` when `bonus` is `True` and then increments the score with this modified value, we can conclude that if the `update_score` function is observed to duplicate points before incrementing the score, it must have been called with `bonus=True`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The `increment` function simply takes an input `x` and returns `x + 1`.\n\n2. The `update_score` function takes three parameters:\n   - `score`: The current score.\n   - `points`: The number of points to add to the score.\n   - `bonus`: A boolean indicating whether a bonus should be applied.\n\n3. Inside `update_score`, if `bonus` is `True`, the `points` are doubled using `points *= 2`.\n\n4. Then, the `score` is updated to the result of calling `increment(score + points)`.\n\nGiven that the `update_score` function indeed duplicates `points` when `bonus=True` and adds this doubled value to the `score` after incrementing, we can conclude that if the `points` are effectively doubled before being added to the `score`, then the `bonus` must have been activated.\n\nTherefore, if we observe the behavior where `points` are duplicated before the score is incremented, it can be assumed that the `bonus` was activated.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The `update_score` function takes three parameters: `score`, `points`, and `bonus`.\n2. If `bonus` is `True`, it doubles the `points` using `points *= 2`.\n3. It then increments the score by adding `points` to `score + increment(score)`. Here, `increment` is a function that adds 1 to its input.\n4. The function returns the updated `score`.\n\nGiven:\n- `score = 10`\n- `points = 5`\n- `bonus = True`\n\nNow, let's see what happens when we call `update_score(score, points, bonus=True)`:\n\n1. Since `bonus` is `True`, `points` will be doubled: `points = 5 * 2 = 10`.\n2. Then, the function calculates `score + points` which is `10 + 10 = 20`.\n3. It increments this value by 1 (since `increment(20) = 20 + 1 = 21`).\n4. Therefore, the final score becomes `21`.\n\nThe key point here is that the function does indeed double the `points` when `bonus` is `True`, and then increments the score based on this modified value.\n\nSince the function's behavior of doubling `points` when `bonus` is `True` is clearly visible in the code and the final score calculation, we can confidently assume that the `bonus` was activated.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the `update_score` function and analyze its behavior when the `bonus` parameter is set to `True`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   ```python\n   def update_score(score, points, bonus=False):\n       if bonus:\n           points *= 2\n       score = increment(score + points)\n       return score\n   ```\n\n2. **Parameter Passing**:\n   - `score`: The initial score value.\n   - `points`: The points to add to the score.\n   - `bonus`: A boolean flag that, if `True`, doubles the `points`.\n\n3. **Condition Check**:\n   - If `bonus` is `True`, the function will execute `points *= 2`.\n\n4. **Score Update**:\n   - Regardless of the `bonus` status, the function calculates `increment(score + points)`.\n   - Here, `increment` is defined as `def increment(x): return x + 1`.\n\n5. **Effect of Bonus**:\n   - When `bonus` is `True`, `points` are doubled before being added to the score.\n   - When `bonus` is `False`, `points` remain unchanged.\n\n6. **Given Example**:\n   - Initial values: `score = 10`, `points = 5`, `bonus = True`.\n   - If `bonus` is `True`, `points` become `10` (i.e., `5 * 2`).\n   - Then, `score = increment(10 + 10)` which is `11 + 1 = 12`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe doubling of `points` before adding them to the score is a direct result of setting `bonus` to `True`. Therefore, if we observe that `points` are indeed doubled before the score is incremented, it confirms that the `bonus` was activated.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `update_score` function takes three parameters: `score`, `points`, and `bonus`.\n\n2.
