    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `CarManufacturingProcess` class has three boolean fields:\n   - `hasEngine`: Initially false.\n   - `hasTransmission`: Initially false.\n   - `qualityCheckPassed`: Initially false.\n\n2. The `installEngine()` method:\n   - Checks if `hasEngine` is false.\n   - If it is, sets `hasEngine` to true.\n\n3. The `installTransmission()` method:\n   - Checks if `hasTransmission` is false.\n   - If it is, sets `hasTransmission` to true.\n\n4. The `performQualityCheck()` method:\n   - Checks if both `hasEngine` and `hasTransmission` are true.\n   - If they are, sets `qualityCheckPassed` to true.\n\n5. The question asks if `qualityCheckPassed` will eventually be true after only calling `installEngine()`.\n\n6. Calling `installEngine()`:\n   - Sets `hasEngine` to true.\n   - Does not change `hasTransmission` or `qualityCheckPassed`.\n\n7. Since `installEngine()` does not set `hasTransmission` to true, `performQualityCheck()` will never be called with both `hasEngine` and `hasTransmission` being true.\n\nTherefore, `qualityCheckPassed` will not be true after only calling `installEngine()`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

Calling `installEngine` alone does not change the value of `hasTransmission`.\n4. Therefore, after calling `installEngine`, `hasEngine` will be true but `hasTransmission` will still be false.\n5.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `CarManufacturingProcess` class has three boolean properties:\n   - `hasEngine`: initially set to `false`\n   - `hasTransmission`: initially set to `false`\n   - `qualityCheckPassed`: initially set to `false`\n\n2. The `installEngine()` method checks if `hasEngine` is `false`. If it is, it sets `hasEngine` to `true`.\n\n3.

The question asks if `qualityCheckPassed` will eventually be `true` after only calling the `installEngine()` method.\n\n5. When we call `installEngine()`, it sets `hasEngine` to `true`. However, `hasTransmission` remains `false`.\n\n6. Since `performQualityCheck()` requires both `hasEngine` and `hasTransmission` to be `true` for `qualityCheckPassed` to become `true`, simply calling `installEngine()` is not enough.\n\n7.
