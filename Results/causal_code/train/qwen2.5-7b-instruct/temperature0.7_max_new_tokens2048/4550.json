    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with a `Product` instance named \"Gadget\" with a base price of 50.\n2. A `Customer` named \"John Doe\" is created, initially not a member.\n3. A `Sale` is made without the customer being a member, so no discount is applied.\n4. The customer registers for membership.\n5. Another `Sale` is made after the customer has registered as a member.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens during these sales:\n\n- In the first sale (`sale`), the customer is not a member, so no discount is applied. The final price remains 50.\n- In the second sale (`another_sale`), the customer is now a member. According to the code, a 10% discount should be applied, lowering the final price to 50 * (1 - 10/100) = 45.\n\nSo, if the final price of the product is found to be lower than the base price (i.e., 45 instead of 50), we can indeed infer that the product was sold to a member customer because only then would the discount be applied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - A `Product` object is created with a base price of $50.\n   - A `Customer` object is created named \"John Doe\" who is not initially a member.\n\n2. **Sale Creation**:\n   - A `Sale` object is created with the product and non-member customer. Since the customer is not a member, no discount is applied.\n\n3. **Membership Registration**:\n   - The customer registers for membership, changing `is_member` to `True`.\n\n4. **Second Sale Creation**:\n   - Another `Sale` object is created with the same product but now the customer is a member. According to the code, a 10% discount should be applied because the customer is a member.\n\nGiven this sequence of events, let's consider the conditions under which the final price of the product could be lower:\n\n- If the final price is lower, it implies that a discount has been applied.\n- The only way a discount can be applied in the provided code is if the customer is a member at the time of the sale.\n\nTherefore, if the final price of the product is found to be lowered, we can indeed infer that the product was sold to a member customer.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
