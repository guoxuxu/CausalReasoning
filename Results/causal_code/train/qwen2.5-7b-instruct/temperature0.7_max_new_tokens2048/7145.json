    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` checks if 'temperature' is in the data.\n2. If 'temperature' is in the data and it's greater than 100, then `data['temp_status']` is set to 'high'.\n3. Next, the function checks if 'humidity' is also in the data AND if `data['temp_status']` is 'high'.\n4. If both conditions (presence of 'humidity' and `temp_status` being 'high') are met, then the function further checks if humidity is greater than 50.\n5. If humidity is greater than 50, the function sets `data['risk']` to 'high'. Otherwise, it sets `data['risk']` to 'moderate'.\n6. If either 'temperature' is not greater than 100 OR 'humidity' is not present, `data['risk']` is set to 'low'.\n\nGiven that we are focusing on the scenario where the temperature is greater than 100:\n- This directly leads to `data['temp_status']` being set to 'high'.\n- The next condition for setting `data['risk']` to 'high' would be that 'humidity' must also be present and greater than 50.\n\nTherefore, with only the condition that the temperature is greater than 100, the risk status could potentially be 'high' if the humidity is also greater than 50.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
