  "Explanation": "Calling the update_temperature method with a positive change increases the temperature. If this updated temperature exceeds 30, the alert state is set to 'High'. Since the initial temperature was 20 and with a positive change of 15 it reaches 35, the alert is 'High'.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `WeatherStation` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the `temperature` attribute.\n2. The `update_temperature` method takes a `change` parameter and adds it to the current `temperature`.\n3. It then checks the updated `temperature`:\n   - If `temperature > 30`, it sets `alert` to 'High'.\n   - If `temperature < 10`, it sets `alert` to 'Low'.\n   - Otherwise, it sets `alert` to 'Normal'.\n\n4. We start with a `station` initialized at `20` degrees.\n5. We call `update_temperature(15)`, which means we add `15` to the initial `20`, resulting in `35` degrees.\n\n6. Since `35` is greater than `30`, the condition `if self.temperature > 30:` is satisfied, and the `alert` is set to 'High'.\n\nTherefore, if the `update_temperature` method is called with a positive change (in this case, `15`), the alert will indeed be 'High' because the new temperature of `35` exceeds the threshold for 'High'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

After updating the temperature, the method checks the new temperature value:\n   - If it's greater than 30, it sets `alert` to 'High'.\n   - If it's less than 10, it sets `alert` to 'Low'.\n   - Otherwise, it sets `alert` to 'Normal'.\n\n4. The initial temperature is set to 20 in the example code.\n\n5. When `update_temperature(15)` is called, the new temperature becomes 20 + 15 = 35.\n\n6. Since 35 is greater than 30, the condition `if self.temperature > 30:` will be true.\n\n7. Therefore, the `alert` will be set to 'High'.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if the `update_temperature` method is called with a positive change (in this case, 15), the alert will indeed likely be 'High'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
