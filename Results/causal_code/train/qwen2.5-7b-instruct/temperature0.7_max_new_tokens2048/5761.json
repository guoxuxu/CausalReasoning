    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding `toggleActiveStatus` Method**:\n   - This method takes a `userId` as input.\n   - It finds the user with the matching `id` in the `users` array.\n   - If the user is found, it toggles the `isActive` property of that user.\n   - If the user is found and the operation is successful, it returns a string indicating the new active status.\n   - If the user is not found, it returns 'User not found'.\n\n2. **Understanding `forwardEmail` Method**:\n   - This method takes `userId` and `emailId` as inputs.\n   - It first finds the user with the matching `id` in the `users` array.\n   - If the user is found and is `isActive`, it adds the `emailId` to the user's `emails` array.\n   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns 'Failed to forward email'.\n\n3. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - If an administrator calls `toggleActiveStatus(userId)` with an active user (i.e., `isActive` is `true`), the `isActive` property of that user will be set to `false`.\n   - Subsequent calls to `forwardEmail(userId, emailId)` for that user will check the `isActive` property.\n   - Since the `isActive` property has been set to `false`, the condition `if (user && user.isActive && emailId)` in the `forwardEmail` method will evaluate to `false`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, if the user is deactivated using `toggleActiveStatus`, subsequent calls to `forwardEmail` for that user will fail because the user will no longer have `isActive` set to `true`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Methods**:\n   - `forwardEmail(userId, emailId)` checks if the user exists, is active, and if an email ID is provided. If all conditions are met, it adds the email ID to the user's emails list and returns \"Email forwarded\". Otherwise, it returns \"Failed to forward email\".\n   - `toggleActiveStatus(userId)` toggles the `isActive` property of the user with the given ID. It returns a message indicating the new status.\n\n2. **Initial State**:\n   - We have two users in the `usersData` array.\n   - User 001 is active (`isActive: true`).\n   - User 002 is inactive (`isActive: false`).\n\n3. **Administrator's Action**:\n   - The administrator uses `toggleActiveStatus('002')` to activate User 002.\n   - This call will set `user.isActive` for User 002 to `true`.\n\n4. **Subsequent `forwardEmail` Calls**:\n   - For `forwardEmail` to be successful, the user must be active (`user.isActive` must be `true`).\n   - Since `toggleActiveStatus('002')` has been called, User 002's `isActive` is now `true`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - With User 002 being active, any subsequent calls to `forwardEmail` for User 002 will succeed as long as the other conditions (user existence and valid email ID) are met.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `toggleActiveStatus` method is called with a `userId`. If the user exists, it toggles their `isActive` property.\n\n2. For the given `usersData`, we have two users:\n   - User 001: isActive = true, emails = []\n   - User 002: isActive = false, emails = []\n\n3. If we call `toggleActiveStatus('002')`, the user with id '002' will have their `isActive` property set to true.\n\n4. The `forwardEmail` method checks three conditions:\n   - The user exists (`this.users.find(u => u.id === userId)` returns a truthy value)\n   - The user is active (`user.isActive` is true)\n   - An email ID is provided (`emailId` is truthy)\n\n5. After activating user 002, all these conditions will be met for subsequent calls to `forwardEmail` when using '002' as the `userId`.\n\n6. Therefore, as long as the correct `userId` ('002') is used and the `emailId` is provided, the `forwardEmail` method should succeed.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
