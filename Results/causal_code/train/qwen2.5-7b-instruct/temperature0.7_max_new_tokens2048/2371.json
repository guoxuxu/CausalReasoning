    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `update_steps` method is called when we want to update the number of daily steps for the user.\n2.

Otherwise (if the total does not exceed 10,000):\n   - The heart rate increases by 1.\n\nFrom this logic, we can see that the heart rate does not necessarily decrease just because the number of daily steps increases. It only decreases if the total steps exceed 10,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

Otherwise (i.e., if the new total steps are 10,000 or less), the heart rate increases by 1.\n\nNow, let's consider different scenarios:\n\n- If the user takes more than 10,000 steps, the heart rate decreases by 2.\n- If the user takes exactly 10,000 steps or fewer, the heart rate either stays the same or increases by 1.\n\nIn no scenario does the heart rate necessarily decrease when the number of daily steps increases.
