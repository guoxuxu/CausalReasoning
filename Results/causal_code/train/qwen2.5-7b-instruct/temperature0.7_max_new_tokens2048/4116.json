    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a single argument `data`.\n\n2.

If 'error' is found, it sets `status` to 'error'. Otherwise, it sets `status` to 'success'.\n\n5. The input `data_input` is '  Example Data ERROR  '.\n\n6. When this input is passed to `process_data`, it gets cleaned to 'example data error'.\n\n7. Since 'error' is indeed present in the cleaned data, the function will set `status` to 'error'.\n\n8. Therefore, if `process_data` returns 'success', it would imply that 'error' was not found in the cleaned data.\n\n9. Given that the function returned 'success', we can conclude that 'error' must have been absent in the cleaned version of the original `data_input`.\n\nHowever, note that the presence or absence of 'error' in the cleaned data doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't there originally due to case sensitivity or formatting issues (like extra spaces).
