    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Calculation**:\n   - `t1 = x * y`\n   - `t2 = t1 + 10`\n\n2. **Conditional Adjustment**:\n   - If `t1 > 50`, then `t2 += 5`.\n\n3. **Effect of Increasing `x`**:\n   - When `x` increases, `t1` will also increase because `t1` is directly proportional to `x`.\n   - As `t1` increases, the likelihood of it being greater than 50 also increases.\n\n4. **Case Analysis**:\n   - **Case 1**: If `t1 <= 50` after increasing `x`, then `t2` will be `t1 + 10`.\n   - **Case 2**: If `t1 > 50` after increasing `x`, then `t2` will be `t1 + 15`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - In both cases, increasing `x` will generally lead to an increase in `t2`, unless `y` decreases significantly to keep `t1` below 50.\n   - However, the question asks if `t2` necessarily increases without altering other variables. Since we don't have information about how `y` changes, we can't definitively say that `t2` will always increase just because `x` increases.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we cannot conclusively state that `t2` will necessarily increase for every increase in `x` without knowing the behavior of `y`. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The value of t2 is initially set to t1 + 10.\n2. If t1 (which is x * y) is greater than 50, t2 gets an additional 5.\n\nNow, let's consider how changes in x affect t2:\n\n3. If x increases:\n   - t1 = x * y will also increase, as long as y remains constant.\n   - Since t1 increases, it will likely be greater than 50 more often.\n   - When t1 > 50, t2 will become t1 + 10 + 5 = t1 + 15.\n\n4. However, there's a critical point where t1 might not increase t2:\n   - If t1 was already greater than 50 before x increased, increasing x won't change t2 because it will still be t1 + 10 + 5.\n   - If t1 was less than or equal to 50, increasing x could push t1 over 50, but only for values of x that make x * y > 50.\n\n5. Therefore, while increasing x generally increases t2, it doesn't necessarily do so in all cases, especially when considering the threshold of 50.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze the function `calculate` step by step to determine if `t2` necessarily increases when `x` increases.\n\n1. **Initial Calculation of `t1`:**\n   - `t1 = x * y`\n   - If `x` increases while `y` remains constant, `t1` will also increase proportionally.\n\n2. **Calculation of `t2`:**\n   - `t2 = t1 + 10`\n   - Since `t1` is increased by the multiplication of `x` and `y`, and then 10 is added to it, `t2` will increase as long as `t1` increases.\n\n3. **Conditional Adjustment:**\n   - `if (t1 > 50) { t2 += 5; }`\n   - This condition checks whether `t1` exceeds 50. If `t1` is greater than 50, an additional 5 is added to `t2`.\n   - The critical point here is that for `t1` to exceed 50, `x` must be sufficiently large (considering the value of `y`). However, once `t1` exceeds 50, there is a guaranteed additional increment of 5 to `t2`.\n\n4. **Analysis:**\n   - When `x` increases, `t1` increases.\n   - As long as `t1` remains above 50 after the multiplication, the additional 5 will be added to `t2`.\n   - Even if `t1` is less than or equal to 50 initially but increases past this threshold due to the increase in `x`, the additional 5 will still be added.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that if `x` increases, `t2` will indeed increase unless `y` decreases in such a way that `t1` never exceeds 50. However, under normal circumstances and without any specific constraints on `y`, the function guarantees that `t2` will increase with an increase in `x`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Here, `t1 = 1 * 51 = 51`, which is just above 50.
