    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `TrafficSystem` starts with the green light set to 'North-South'. This means that any cars arriving at the intersection will be counted under the 'North-South' key in the `cars_waiting` dictionary.\n\n2. **Car Arrival**: When cars arrive, they are added to the `cars_waiting` dictionary under their respective direction. For example, if cars arrive from the North-South direction, they are added to `self.cars_waiting['North-South']`.\n\n3. **Switching the Light**: The `switch_light` method changes the green light direction from 'North-South' to 'East-West'. However, this does not immediately clear any cars from the 'North-South' lane.\n\n4. **Clearing Cars**: The `clear_cars` method clears the number of cars that have been waiting for the current green light direction (which is still 'North-South' right after switching). It returns the number of cars that were cleared and resets the count in the `cars_waiting` dictionary for the current green light direction.\n\nGiven these steps, when the light switches from 'North-South' to 'East-West':\n\n- The `cars_waiting['North-South']` count is not reset until the `clear_cars` method is called.\n- The `clear_cars` method only clears the cars that have been waiting since the last time the green light was 'North-South'.\n\nTherefore, the light switching itself does not immediately clear any cars; it only triggers the clearing process when `clear_cars` is called.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficSystem` class has a green light that can be either 'North-South' or 'East-West'.\n2. When the green light is 'North-South', cars arriving from the 'North-South' direction increment the count in `cars_waiting['North-South']`.\n3. The `switch_light()` method changes the green light direction.\n4. The `clear_cars()` method clears the cars from the current green light direction and returns the number of cleared cars.\n\nWhen the green light switches from 'North-South' to 'East-West':\n\n- This change does not immediately clear any cars; it just sets the new green light direction.\n- The `clear_cars()` method only clears cars when called after the green light has been switched.\n\nTherefore, switching the light from 'North-South' to 'East-West' alone does not result in clearing all waiting North-South cars. It only sets up the condition for those cars to be cleared if `clear_cars()` is subsequently called.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficSystem` class has an attribute `green_light` which determines which direction is currently allowed to pass.\n2. When the green light is set to 'North-South', cars can only go North-South, and the number of waiting cars for that direction is tracked.\n3. The `switch_light()` method changes the `green_light` attribute from 'North-South' to 'East-West'.\n4. The `clear_cars()` method clears the cars waiting in the direction of the current `green_light`.\n\nGiven these points, let's consider what happens when the light switches from 'North-South' to 'East-West':\n\n- If the green light is currently 'North-South', calling `switch_light()` will change it to 'East-West'.\n- At this point, there are no cars waiting for 'East-West' because the light was previously 'North-South' and thus, the `cars_waiting` dictionary still has 0 for 'East-West'.\n- However, there could be cars waiting for 'North-South' if they arrived while the light was 'North-South'.\n\nWhen `clear_cars()` is called after switching the light:\n\n- It will clear the cars waiting in the direction of the current `green_light`, which is now 'East-West'.\n- Since there are no cars waiting for 'East-West', `clear_cars()` will return 0.\n\nTherefore, the light switching from 'North-South' to 'East-West' does not result in clearing all waiting North-South cars; it only clears any waiting East-West cars.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficSystem` class has an attribute `green_light` which is initially set to 'North-South'.\n2. When the `switch_light()` method is called, it changes the value of `green_light` to 'East-West'.\n3. The `clear_cars()` method clears the number of cars waiting in the direction of the current green light and returns that number.\n4. If `switch_light()` is called, it changes the green light to 'East-West'.\n5. Subsequently, calling `clear_cars()` would then clear the number of cars waiting in the 'East-West' direction.\n\nGiven this information, when the traffic light switches from 'North-South' to 'East-West':\n\n- All cars waiting in the 'North-South' direction are not cleared immediately.\n- The `clear_cars()` method will only clear the cars waiting in the 'East-West' direction after the light has been switched.\n\nTherefore, switching the light from 'North-South' to 'East-West' does not result in clearing all waiting North-South cars.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The `clear_cars` method clears the cars waiting in the current green light direction ('East-West' in this case) and returns the number of cleared cars.\n6. However, the `clear_cars` method only clears cars when called, not automatically when the light changes.\n\nGiven that the `clear_cars` method needs to be explicitly called to clear the cars, simply switching the light from 'North-South' to 'East-West' does not result in clearing all the waiting North-South cars.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The traffic light is set to 'North-South'. This means that the green light is on for North-South traffic, and no cars have arrived yet.\n\n2. **Car Arrival**: When a car arrives in any direction (North-South or East-West), it increments the `cars_waiting` counter for that direction. However, since the initial state has the green light on for North-South, only North-South cars would be counted here initially.\n\n3. **Light Switch**: The `switch_light` method changes the green light direction from 'North-South' to 'East-West'. This change does not immediately clear any cars; it only updates which direction can now pass through the intersection.\n\n4. **Clearing Cars**: The `clear_cars` method clears the cars waiting for the current green light direction ('East-West' after the switch). It returns the number of cars that were cleared.\n\nGiven these steps, we need to determine if switching the light from 'North-South' to 'East-West' will result in clearing all waiting North-South cars.\n\n- The switch itself does not immediately clear any cars.\n- It only indicates that the green light is now for East-West traffic.\n- Any North-South cars that were waiting would only be cleared when the green light for North-South is activated again.\n\nTherefore, simply switching the light from 'North-South' to 'East-West' does not result in clearing the North-South cars.

It then clears the cars waiting in that direction (`self.cars_waiting[self.green_light]`).\n\nGiven that the green light has just switched from 'North-South' to 'East-West', the `clear_cars` method will now check `self.green_light`, which is set to 'East-West'.\n\nTherefore, `self.cars_waiting['East-West']` will be cleared, but `self.cars_waiting['North-South']` will remain untouched because it's not the current green light.\n\nSince the question asks if all waiting North-South cars will be cleared, and we've established that they won't be, the answer is no.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
