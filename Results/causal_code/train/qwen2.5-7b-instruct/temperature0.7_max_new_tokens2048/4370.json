    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes two parameters: `data` (a list of numbers) and `filter_param` (a number used to filter the data).\n\n2. Inside the function:\n   - It creates `cleaned_data`, which contains only the elements from `data` that are greater than `filter_param`.\n   - It calculates the mean of these filtered values.\n   - It counts how many elements are in `cleaned_data`.\n\n3. In the provided example:\n   - `data = [5, 12, 20, 6, 3]`\n   - `filter_param = 10`\n   \n4. Applying the filter:\n   - Only `20` is greater than `10`, so `cleaned_data = [20]`.\n\n5. The summary returned would be:\n   - 'mean': 20 (since 20/1 = 20)\n   - 'count': 1 (since there's only one element in `cleaned_data`)\n\n6. Observing the 'count' in the summary:\n   - The count tells us how many elements were left after applying the filter.\n   - However, it does not give us the exact values that remained.\n\n7. To determine the exact values in the 'data', we would need more information than just the count; we would need either the mean or the actual list of filtered values.\n\nTherefore, based on the count alone, we cannot determine the exact values in the original 'data'. \n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
