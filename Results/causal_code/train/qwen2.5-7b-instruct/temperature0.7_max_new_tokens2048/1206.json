    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a `Product` instance named `snack` with a base price of 200.\n2. **Apply Discount**: The discount is applied at 10%. This reduces the final price from 200 to 180.\n3. **Increase Base Price**: Then, the base price is increased by 50, making it 250.\n4. **Recompute Final Price**: Since there's still a discount applied (10%), the final price is recomputed as 250 - (250 * 0.1) = 225.\n\nNow, let's consider removing the discount entirely:\n\n1. **Remove Discount**: If we remove the discount, the `discount` attribute becomes 0.\n2. **Recompute Final Price Without Discount**: With no discount, the final price is simply the new base price, which is now 250.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n- **With Discount**: Final price = 225\n- **Without Discount**: Final price = 250\n\nIn this specific case, removing the discount increases the final price from 225 to 250.\n\nHowever, to generalize, let's consider another scenario where the base price and discount percentage are different:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Let's assume the base price is 100 and a discount of 20% is applied.\n2. **Apply Discount**: Final price = 100 - (100 * 0.2) = 80.\n3. **Increase Base Price**: Increase the base price by 50, making it 150.\n4. **Recompute Final Price**: With no discount, the final price is 150.\n\nIn this case:\n- **With Discount**: Final price = 80\n- **Without Discount**: Final price = 150\n\nAgain, removing the discount increases the final price.\n\nFrom these examples, we can see that generally, removing a discount on a product with an increased base price will result in a higher final price, assuming the increase in base price is significant enough to outweigh the discount.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a `Product` instance named `snack` with a base price of 200.\n2. **Apply Discount**: The `apply_discount` method is called with a 10% discount. This reduces the `discount` attribute to 10 and calculates the `final_price` as follows:\n   - `final_price = base_price - (base_price * (discount / 100))`\n   - `final_price = 200 - (200 * (10 / 100))`\n   - `final_price = 200 - 20`\n   - `final_price = 180`\n\n3. **Price Increase**: Next, the `price_increase` method is called with an increase amount of 50. This updates the `base_price` and recalculates the `final_price`:\n   - `base_price += increase_amount`\n   - `base_price = 180 + 50`\n   - `base_price = 230`\n   - Since there's still a discount applied (`discount > 0`), the final price is recalculated:\n     - `final_price = base_price - (base_price * (discount / 100))`\n     - `final_price = 230 - (230 * (10 / 100))`\n     - `final_price = 230 - 23`\n     - `final_price = 207`\n\n4. **Removing Discount**: If we remove the discount by setting `self.discount = 0`, then:\n   - `final_price = base_price`\n   - `final_price = 230`\n\n5. **Comparison**: \n   - With the discount applied, the final price was 207.\n   - Without the discount, the final price is 230.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Removing the discount results in a higher final price (230) compared to when the discount was applied (207).\n\nTherefore, removing any discount would indeed result in the final price of the product increasing, given that the `price_increase` has already been applied.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
