    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_scores` assigns letter grades based on the average grade of each student.\n2. The grading scale used is:\n   - A: Average grade >= 90\n   - B: Average grade >= 80\n   - C: Average grade >= 70\n   - F: Otherwise\n3. Extra credit assignments would typically increase a student's total score without changing the number of grades they received.\n4. If a student receives extra credit, their average grade would likely increase.\n5. An increase in the frequency of 'A' grades could indeed be due to the introduction of extra credit assignments, as these would raise average scores, potentially moving more students into the 'A' category.\n6. However, it's not the only possible cause; other factors like changes in teaching methods, student preparation, or even random variations could also affect the distribution of grades.\n\nGiven that the introduction of extra credit assignments would logically lead to higher average grades and thus more 'A' grades, we can reasonably conclude that this is a plausible explanation for the increased frequency of 'A' grades.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_scores` takes a dictionary `data` as input, where keys are student names and values are lists of grades.\n\n2. It calculates the average grade for each student and assigns a letter grade based on the following criteria:\n   - A: Average grade ≥ 90\n   - B: 80 ≤ Average grade < 90\n   - C: 70 ≤ Average grade < 80\n   - F: Average grade < 70\n\n3. The question asks if an increase in the frequency of 'A' grades could be due to the recent integration of extra credit assignments.\n\n4. Extra credit assignments typically allow students to improve their overall grade without affecting their existing grades. This means that if a student had an average below 90 but completed extra credit, their new average could now meet or exceed 90, resulting in an 'A'.\n\n5. Therefore, the introduction of extra credit could indeed lead to more 'A' grades being assigned, as some students who previously did not qualify for an 'A' might now do so due to these additional points.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Function Analysis**:\n   - The function `calculate_scores` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n   - It calculates the average grade for each student.\n   - Based on the average grade, it assigns a letter grade ('A', 'B', 'C', or 'F').\n\n2. **Grade Distribution**:\n   - 'A': Average grade >= 90\n   - 'B': 80 <= average grade < 90\n   - 'C': 70 <= average grade < 80\n   - 'F': average grade < 70\n\n3. **Extra Credit Impact**:\n   - Extra credit assignments typically increase the overall score for students who complete them.\n   - If extra credit has been integrated recently, it would generally raise the average grades of students who do well on these assignments.\n\n4. **Effect on Grade Distribution**:\n   - Students with higher average grades (closer to or above 90) are more likely to receive an 'A'.\n   - Therefore, if extra credit has been integrated, we might expect to see an increase in the number of 'A' grades.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the frequency of 'A' grades has increased in the summary outputs, it is reasonable to conclude that this could indeed be due to the recent integration of extra credit assignments.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
