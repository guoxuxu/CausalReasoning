  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Adjusting the lowest possible score increases the overall range and floor for average calculations. This intervention is likely to shift borderline average scores over the threshold values (e.g., from just below 70 to just above), thereby slightly improving the final summary grades of some students at the lower end.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Current Grade Distribution Logic**:\n   - A student gets an 'A' if their average grade is 90 or above.\n   - A student gets a 'B' if their average grade is between 80 and 89 (inclusive).\n   - A student gets a 'C' if their average grade is between 70 and 79 (inclusive).\n   - A student gets an 'F' if their average grade is below 70.\n\n2. **New Educational Policy**:\n   - The new policy changes the lowest possible grade from below 70 to 50.\n\n3. **Impact on Grade Distribution**:\n   - Students who previously had an average grade of 50-69 would now fall into the 'C' category instead of 'F'.\n   - Students with an average grade of 70 or above would remain in the same categories ('A', 'B', 'C').\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The adaptation will indeed change the grade distribution in the summary because students who were originally getting an 'F' will now get a 'C'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The current grading system in the `calculate_scores` function:\n   - A: average grade >= 90\n   - B: average grade >= 80 and < 90\n   - C: average grade >= 70 and < 80\n   - F: average grade < 70\n\n2. The proposed change in the educational policy sets the lowest possible grade to 50.\n\n3. This means that any student whose average grade was previously below 70 (and thus received an 'F') might now have an average grade of 50 or above, potentially changing their grade from 'F' to either 'C', 'B', or 'A'.\n\n4. Students with average grades between 70 and 80 (originally getting a 'C') could still fall into the same category if their grades remain unchanged or improve.\n\n5. Students with average grades between 80 and 90 (originally getting a 'B') could still fall into the same category if their grades remain unchanged or improve.\n\n6. Students with average grades of 90 or above (originally getting an 'A') would remain in the same category unless their grades drop below 90.\n\nGiven these points, the introduction of the new policy, which sets the lowest possible grade to 50, will indeed change the grade distribution in the summary because students who were originally getting an 'F' can now get at least a 'C'. Therefore, the grade distribution will be altered.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Current Policy**: The current grading policy sets the cutoffs as follows:\n   - A: Average grade ≥ 90\n   - B: 80 ≤ Average grade < 90\n   - C: 70 ≤ Average grade < 80\n   - F: Average grade < 70\n\n2. **New Policy**: The new policy changes the lowest possible grade to 50. This means:\n   - The range for an F grade is now 0 ≤ Average grade < 50 (since 50 is the new minimum passing score).\n\n3. **Impact on Grades**:\n   - Students who previously had an average grade of 50 or higher would still fall into the same categories (A, B, C, or F).\n   - However, students who had an average grade below 50 under the old system (and thus received an F) may now receive a different grade if their average grade is now between 50 and 69.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The new policy will change the grade distribution because it expands the range for each grade category.\n   - Specifically, any student whose average grade was previously 50-69 will now get a grade of C instead of F.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Current Grading System**: The current grading system uses thresholds of 90, 80, 70, and below 70 to assign grades A, B, C, and F respectively.\n\n2. **New Policy**: The new policy changes the lowest possible grade from whatever it currently is (which we don't know but is assumed to be less than 50) to 50.\n\n3. **Impact on Average Grade**: If a student's lowest grade was previously below 50, and the new policy sets the lowest possible grade to 50, this could potentially raise the student's average grade because the lowest grade is now at least 50, which is higher than what it was before.\n\n4. **Impact on Summary Grades**:\n   - Students who were originally failing (with an average grade below 70) might now have an average grade of 70 or above, changing their grade from F to C.\n   - Students with an average grade between 70 and 80 might see no change or a slight improvement in their grade, depending on how close they were to the 80 threshold.\n   - Students with an average grade between 80 and 90 might still get a B, but the distribution might shift slightly.\n   - Students with an average grade of 90 or above would likely still get an A.\n\nGiven these points, the new policy will indeed change the grade distributions in the summary because some students who were previously failing will now pass, and the overall average grades might shift upwards.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the current grading system**:\n   - The function `calculate_scores` assigns grades based on the average grade of each student.\n   - If the average grade is 90 or above, the student gets an 'A'.\n   - If the average grade is between 80 and 89, the student gets a 'B'.\n   - If the average grade is between 70 and 79, the student gets a 'C'.\n   - If the average grade is below 70, the student gets an 'F'.\n\n2. **Effect of the new policy**:\n   - The new policy changes the lowest possible grade from any value (let's assume it was previously lower than 50) to 50.\n   - This means that even if a student has all grades below 50, their average grade will now be at least 50.\n\n3. **Impact on grade distribution**:\n   - With the new policy, every student who had an average grade below 70 (which would have resulted in an 'F') will now have at least a 'C'.\n   - Students who were previously getting 'B's or 'A's will remain in the same category since their average grades are not affected by this policy.\n   - Students who were previously getting 'C's may still get 'C's, but they won't drop to 'F's anymore.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The grade distribution will indeed change because students who were previously at the bottom of the scale (with average grades just under 70) will now receive at least a 'C'.\n   - No student will receive an 'F' anymore, as the lowest possible average grade is now 50.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the adaptation will change the grade distributions in the summary.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the adaptation of the lowest possible grade to 50 will change the grade distributions in the `summary`, let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the current grading system**:\n   - If a student's average grade is >= 90, they get an 'A'.\n   - If a student's average grade is >= 80, they get a 'B'.\n   - If a student's average grade is >= 70, they get a 'C'.\n   - Otherwise, they get an 'F'.\n\n2. **Impact of changing the lowest possible grade to 50**:\n   - This change affects the calculation of `average_grade` because it sets a lower threshold for the minimum grade a student can receive.\n   - With the lowest possible grade set to 50, any student who had an average grade below 70 but now has at least one grade of 50 (or more) could potentially improve their overall average grade.\n\n3. **Analyzing the effect on the summary**:\n   - Students who previously had an average grade below 70 but included some grades below 70 might now have an average grade that meets the criteria for a 'C' or higher due to the inclusion of the new lowest possible grade.\n   - Conversely, students whose average grade was just above 70 might now be pushed into the 'B' category if they include a 50.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The change in the lowest possible grade can affect the average grades of students, which in turn can change their corresponding letter grades in the `summary`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the adaptation will indeed change the grade distributions in the `summary`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
