  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Manually setting the 'body_temperature' to 40 and running 'check_symptoms()' forces the body temperature to a state that is recognized as a fever (>38), hence 'fever' will be set to true regardless of the previous state or external temperature.",
  "causal_map": "body_temperature → fever; has_sickness → body_temperature; external_temp → body_temperature",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting body_temperature to 40 directly causes fever to be true; has_sickness increases body_temperature which can lead to fever; external_temp influences body_temperature which can trigger cold or fever symptoms.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with the `body_temperature` set to 40.\n2. The `check_symptoms()` method is called.\n3. Inside `check_symptoms()`, there are three conditions checked in order:\n   - If `body_temperature < 36`: This condition is not met (40 is not less than 36).\n   - If `body_temperature > 38`: This condition is met (40 is greater than 38).\n   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it falls into the else block.\n\n4. When `body_temperature > 38`, the method sets:\n   - `self.cold = False`\n   - `self.fever = True`\n\nTherefore, after calling `check_symptoms()` with `body_temperature` set to 40, the `fever` attribute will indeed be set to `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
