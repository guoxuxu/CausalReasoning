    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `adjust_signal_duration` function determines the signal duration based on the pedestrian count.\n2. If the pedestrian count is greater than 10, the signal duration is set to 60 seconds.\n3. If the pedestrian count is 10 or less, the signal duration is set to 30 seconds.\n4. The pedestrian count is generated using `generate_pedestrian_count()`, which returns a random integer between 0 and 20.\n5. Therefore, as the pedestrian count increases from 0 to 10, the signal duration remains at 30 seconds.\n6. Only when the pedestrian count exceeds 10 does the signal duration increase to 60 seconds.\n\nGiven this logic, we can conclude that the signal duration does not necessarily increase with every increment in the pedestrian count. It only increases once the count surpasses 10.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `pedestrian_count` is generated randomly between 0 and 20.\n2. The `adjust_signal_duration` function determines the signal duration based on the `pedestrian_count`.\n   - If `pedestrian_count > 10`, the duration is set to 60 seconds.\n   - Otherwise, it is set to 30 seconds.\n3. The `is_emergency` function randomly determines whether the signal is in emergency mode or not.\n4. The `traffic_signal` function returns either a blinking signal (if in emergency mode) or the determined duration.\n\nGiven these steps, we can analyze the relationship between `pedestrian_count` and `duration`:\n\n- If the `pedestrian_count` is greater than 10, the `duration` will be 60 seconds.\n- If the `pedestrian_count` is 10 or less, the `duration` will be 30 seconds.\n\nHowever, the question asks if the `signal duration` necessarily increases with an increase in `pedestrian_count`. \n\n- For `pedestrian_count` values from 0 to 10, the `duration` remains constant at 30 seconds.\n- For `pedestrian_count` values from 11 to 20, the `duration` increases to 60 seconds.\n\nTherefore, while there is a trend where increasing `pedestrian_count` tends to increase the `duration`, it does not necessarily increase for every increment in `pedestrian_count`. Specifically, if `pedestrian_count` is between 10 and 11, the `duration` remains the same despite the increase in count.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is no, the signal duration does not necessarily increase with an increase in pedestrian count.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `pedestrian_count` directly affects the `duration` of the traffic signal.\n   - If `pedestrian_count` > 10, then `duration` = 60 seconds.\n   - Otherwise, `duration` = 30 seconds.\n\n2. The `is_emergency` condition does not affect the relationship between `pedestrian_count` and `duration`. It only determines whether the signal \"blinks\" or has a fixed duration.\n\n3. When `is_emergency` is True, the signal status is set to 'blink', which doesn't change based on `pedestrian_count`.\n\n4. However, when `is_emergency` is False (the normal operating condition), the signal duration is determined solely by the `pedestrian_count`.\n\n5. Therefore, if the `pedestrian_count` is greater than 10, the `duration` will be 60 seconds, which is longer than 30 seconds.\n\n6. Conversely, if the `pedestrian_count` is 10 or less, the `duration` will be 30 seconds.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that if the pedestrian count increases, the signal duration will increase as long as it passes the threshold of 10. If it stays below 10, increasing the count won't change the duration from 30 seconds.\n\nHowever, the question asks if the signal duration \"necessarily\" increases. This implies a guarantee without any exceptions, which isn't the case here because the count needs to exceed 10 for the duration to increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
