    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `decide_outfit` function determines the outfit based on the weather condition.\n2. In the `decide_outfit` function:\n   - If the weather is 'sunny', it returns 't-shirt'.\n   - If the weather is 'rainy', it returns 'raincoat'.\n   - If the weather is 'cloudy', it returns 'sweater'.\n\n3. We are asked if the chosen outfit being a t-shirt means the weather was definitely sunny.\n\n4. From the logic in `decide_outfit`, we can see that only when the weather is 'sunny' does it return 't-shirt'.\n\n5. However, we need to consider the randomness of the weather selection:\n   - There are three possible weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', 'cloudy'.\n   - Each has an equal chance of being selected (1/3 probability).\n\n6. Even though 't-shirt' is returned only for 'sunny' weather, there's still a chance (1/3) that another weather condition could have been randomly selected, which would not result in a t-shirt.\n\n7. Therefore, while it is highly likely that the weather was sunny if the chosen outfit is a t-shirt, we cannot say with certainty that the weather was definitely sunny.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

If the weather is 'sunny', the function returns 't-shirt'.\n3. However, if the weather is 'rainy', the function returns 'raincoat'.\n4. For 'cloudy' weather, the function returns 'sweater'.\n5. Therefore, getting a 't-shirt' as the chosen outfit only indicates that the weather was 'sunny', because 't-shirt' is returned exclusively for 'sunny' weather.\n\nGiven this logic, if the chosen outfit is a t-shirt, we can indeed infer that the weather was definitely sunny.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
