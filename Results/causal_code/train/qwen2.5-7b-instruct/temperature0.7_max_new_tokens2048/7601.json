    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The thermostat starts with a default current temperature of 70°F.\n2.

Inside `adjust_temperature`, for a 'cold_wave', the current temperature is decreased by 10 degrees.\n4.

This means the temperature is now above the initial 70°F, but whether it will go below the desired temperature again depends on the value of `desired_temp`.\n\nHowever, the question asks if the thermostat will eventually activate the heating mechanism. Since the temperature was lowered by 10°F during the cold wave and then increased by 5°F, the temperature is still lower than the initial 70°F unless the desired temperature is set higher than 70°F. If the desired temperature is 70°F or higher, the thermostat will eventually call the `heat_room` method to bring the temperature back up.\n\nSince the problem does not specify the desired temperature and the thermostat's behavior is dependent on the desired temperature being met, we can conclude that under normal circumstances (assuming the desired temperature is 70°F or higher), the thermostat will indeed activate the heating mechanism.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
