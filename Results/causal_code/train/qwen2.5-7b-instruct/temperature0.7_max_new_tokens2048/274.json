    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `adjust_discount` function determines the discount based on two conditions:\n   - If age > 60, the discount is 0.2.\n   - If customer_loyalty > 5, the discount is 0.15.\n   - Otherwise, the discount is 0.1.\n\n2. We are asked if observing a discount of 0.2 allows us to conclude that the customer's age is over 60.\n\n3. Looking at the function logic:\n   - The only condition that sets the discount to 0.2 is when age > 60.\n   - There is no other condition that would result in a discount of 0.2.\n\n4. Therefore, if we observe a discount of 0.2, it must be because the age condition was met, i.e., the customer's age is indeed over 60.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The key point is that the function does not allow for a discount of 0.2 unless the age is explicitly greater than 60.
