  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Turning on the heater triggers the 'heating_system' function, where 'heater_on' being True results in an increase of 5 degrees to 'current_temperature'. This directly demonstrates the effect of the cause (i.e., the heater being on) on the effect (i.e., increased temperature).",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TemperatureController` class has an `adjust_temperature` method that calls the `heating_system` method.\n2.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TemperatureController` class has an `adjust_temperature` method that calls the `heating_system` method with specific parameters.\n\n2.

The question specifically asks what happens when the heater control is turned on. This means we should consider the case where `heater_on` is True.\n\n4. When `heater_on` is True, the `heating_system` method will execute the block of code that increases the current temperature by 5 degrees.\n\n5.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1.

When `heater_on` is True (i.e., the heater is turned on), the following happens inside the `heating_system` method:\n   - The current temperature increases by 5 degrees.\n   - The current temperature also increases by 10% of the outdoor temperature (in this case, 5 degrees).\n\n3. Given that the outdoor temperature is fixed at 5 degrees for simplicity, the additional temperature increase due to outdoor temperature would be:\n   - 5 degrees * 0.1 = 0.5 degrees\n\n4.
