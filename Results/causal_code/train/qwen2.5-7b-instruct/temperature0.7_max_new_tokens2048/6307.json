    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `ActivateImmunity` method sets the `immune` property to `true`.\n2. When `TakeDamage` is called with `immune` set to `true`, it checks the condition `if (!immune)`.\n3. Since `immune` is now `true`, the condition `if (!immune)` evaluates to `false`.\n4. As a result, the damage calculation (`health -= damage`) is skipped.\n5.
