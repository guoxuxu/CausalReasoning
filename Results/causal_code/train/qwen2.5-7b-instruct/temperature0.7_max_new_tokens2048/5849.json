    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `administerTreatment` method iterates over each patient in the `patients` array.\n2. For each patient, it checks if the patient has the symptom 'fever' using `patient.symptoms.includes('fever')`.\n3. If the patient has the symptom 'fever', the following actions occur:\n   - The patient's health index is increased by the treatment's efficacy.\n   - The 'fever' symptom is removed from the patient's symptoms list.\n   - The treatment's usage count is incremented by 1.\n\n4. Now, consider adding a patient without the symptom 'fever'. This patient would not meet the condition `patient.symptoms.includes('fever')` in the `administerTreatment` method.\n\n5. Since the new patient does not have the 'fever' symptom, they will not trigger any of the actions inside the if block.\n\n6.
