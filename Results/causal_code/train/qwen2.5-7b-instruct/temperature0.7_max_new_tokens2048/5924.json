    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes an `input_data` dictionary as an argument.\n2. It checks if the key `'temperature'` exists in `input_data`.\n3. If `'temperature'` exists, it assigns its value to `temp`.\n4. It then checks if `temp` is greater than 30:\n   - If true, it sets `output_data['status']` to 'hot'.\n   - If false, it sets `output_data['status']` to 'normal'.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude:\n\n- For `output_data['status']` to be set to 'hot', the condition `temp > 30` must be true.\n- This means that if `output_data['status']` is 'hot', it is directly inferred from the condition being met.\n\nTherefore, if 'status' in the output_data is 'hot', we can indeed deduce that the temperature was definitely above 30.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes an `input_data` dictionary as an argument.\n2. It initializes an empty dictionary `output_data`.\n3.

Next, it checks if the key 'pressure' exists in `input_data`:\n   - If it does, it retrieves the value of 'pressure' and stores it in the variable `pressure`.\n   - Depending on the value of `pressure`, it either sets `output_data['alert']` to 'high' or 'normal'.\n5.

The condition for setting 'status' to 'hot' is explicitly stated as `if temp > 30`.\n6.
