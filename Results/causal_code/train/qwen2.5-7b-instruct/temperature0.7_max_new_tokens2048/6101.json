  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The fan turns on when the adjusted humidity level exceeds 80. Setting the `humid_level` high enough to achieve this adjusted value will indeed turn on the fan. For instance, setting it to at least 74 would result in an adjusted humidity of approximately 80, thereby turning the fan on.",
  "causal_map": "humid_level → humidity; humidity → fan_status; fan_status → fan_output",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting the humid_level higher increases the humidity, which in turn turns the fan on if the humidity exceeds 80, resulting in a fan_status of 'on'. Therefore, setting the humid_level to a value that increases humidity above 80 will likely turn the fan on.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `adjust_humidity(level)` takes a single parameter `level`, which is the humidity level.\n2. Inside the function, `humidity` is calculated as `level * 1.08`.\n3. The function then checks if `humidity` is greater than 80.\n4. If `humidity` is greater than 80, `fan_status` is set to 'on'. Otherwise, it is set to 'off'.\n5. The function returns `fan_status`.\n\nNow let's apply this to the given `humid_level` of 75:\n\n1. `humidity = 75 * 1.08 = 81`\n2. Since `humidity` (81) is greater than 80, `fan_status` will be set to 'on'.\n\nTherefore, if `humid_level` is set to 75, the fan will indeed turn on.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Input**: The function `adjust_humidity` is called with `humid_level = 75`.\n2. **Humidity Calculation**: Inside the function, the humidity is calculated as `level * 1.08`.
