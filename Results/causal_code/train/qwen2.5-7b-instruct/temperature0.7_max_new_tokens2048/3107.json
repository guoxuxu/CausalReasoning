  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Adding 10 units of fuel ensures that `fuel_level` is greater than zero. According to the `start_engine` method, the engine status is set to 'on' only if there is more than 0 units of fuel. Therefore, the engine will start.",
  "causal_map": "add_fuel → fuel_level; fuel_level > 0 → engine_status = 'on'; engine_status = 'on' → drive; fuel_level > 0 → drive; fuel_level -= 1 → fuel_level; fuel_level == 0 → engine_status = 'off'",
  "causal_map_integration": "Adding 10 units of fuel increases the fuel level, which enables starting the engine if the fuel level is greater than 0, and driving if both the engine is on and there is fuel. If the fuel level reaches 0 while driving, the engine stops.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with an instance of the Car class.\n2. The initial state is that the `fuel_level` is 0 and the `engine_status` is 'off'.\n3. We call the `add_fuel` method with an argument of 10.\n   - This increases the `fuel_level` from 0 to 10.\n4. Now, let's check the current state:\n   - `fuel_level` is 10\n   - `engine_status` is still 'off'\n5. We then call the `start_engine` method.\n6. In the `start_engine` method, there's a condition:\n   - If `self.fuel_level > 0`, the engine status is set to 'on'.\n7. Since `fuel_level` is 10 (which is greater than 0), the condition is true.\n8.

The method does not perform any additional checks after setting `engine_status` to 'on', so there's no further action based on the current state.\n\nBased on this reasoning, after adding 10 units of fuel and attempting to start the engine, the `engine_status` will indeed be 'on'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
