  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The function 'calculate_discount' offers a greater discount with 'SAVE20' (20) compared to 'SAVE10' (10), resulting in a lower total_price when using 'SAVE20'. This follows directly from the function's explicit mapping of coupon codes to discount values.",
  "causal_map": "coupon_code → discount; discount → total_price; price → total_price",
  "causal_map_integration": "The coupon code directly influences the discount, which in turn directly influences the total price. The original price also directly influences the total price.",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The `calculate_discount` function takes two parameters: `price` and `coupon_code`.\n2. If `coupon_code` is 'SAVE10', the discount is set to 10.\n3. If `coupon_code` is 'SAVE20', the discount is set to 20.\n4. The `total_price` is calculated as `price - discount`.\n5. In the `main()` function, `calculate_discount(100, 'SAVE10')` is called, resulting in a discount of 10 and a `final_price` of 90.\n6. If we were to call `calculate_discount(100, 'SAVE20')`, the discount would be 20, resulting in a `total_price` of 80.\n\nSince 80 (from 'SAVE20') is indeed less than 90 (from 'SAVE10'), the answer to the question is \"Yes\".\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `calculate_discount` function to reason through this:\n\n1. The function `calculate_discount` takes two parameters: `price` and `coupon_code`.\n2. It initializes `discount` to 0.\n3. If `coupon_code` is 'SAVE10', it sets `discount` to 10.\n4. If `coupon_code` is 'SAVE20', it sets `discount` to 20.\n5. It calculates `total_price` as `price - discount`.\n6. It returns `total_price`.\n\nNow let's apply this logic for both coupon codes:\n\n- For 'SAVE10':\n  - `discount` = 10\n  - `total_price` = `price` - 10\n  - If `price` is 100, `total_price` = 100 - 10 = 90\n\n- For 'SAVE20':\n  - `discount` = 20\n  - `total_price` = `price` - 20\n  - If `price` is 100, `total_price` = 100 - 20 = 80\n\nComparing the two:\n- When `coupon_code` is 'SAVE10', `total_price` is 90.\n- When `coupon_code` is 'SAVE20', `total_price` is 80.\n\nSince 80 (when using 'SAVE20') is indeed less than 90 (when using 'SAVE10'), the answer to the question is \"Yes\".\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Finally, it returns `total_price`.\n\nNow, let's consider the two scenarios:\n\n### Scenario 1: Coupon Code is 'SAVE10'\n- `discount` is set to 10.\n- For a `price` of 100, `total_price` would be \\( 100 - 10 = 90 \\).\n\n### Scenario 2: Coupon Code is 'SAVE20'\n- `discount` is set to 20.\n- For a `price` of 100, `total_price` would be \\( 100 - 20 = 80 \\).\n\nComparing the results:\n- When the coupon code is 'SAVE10', the `total_price` is 90.\n- When the coupon code is 'SAVE20', the `total_price` is 80.\n\nSince 80 (for 'SAVE20') is indeed less than 90 (for 'SAVE10'), the answer to the question is \"Yes\".\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
