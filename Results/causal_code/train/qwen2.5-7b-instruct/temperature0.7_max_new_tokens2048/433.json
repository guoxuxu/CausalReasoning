    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `add_item` method takes two parameters: `item` and `price`.\n2.

The `total` attribute of the ShoppingCart instance is incremented by the `price` of the item being added.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that when an item is added to the ShoppingCart, its price is directly added to the `total`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Adds the `price` of the item to the `total` attribute.\n\n3. The `price` parameter directly corresponds to the cost of the item being added.\n\n4. By adding the `price` to the `total`, the method ensures that the total amount in the cart increases by the exact amount of the item's price.\n\n5. This means that every time an item is added, the total is incremented by the item's price.\n\nTherefore, based on this logic, when an item is added to the cart, the total will indeed increase.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
