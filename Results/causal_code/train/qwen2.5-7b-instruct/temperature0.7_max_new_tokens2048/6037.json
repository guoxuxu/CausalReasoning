    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate` takes two integers `x` and `y`, and calculates `t2` based on these inputs.\n2. First, it computes `t1 = x * y`.\n3. Then, `t2 = t1 + 10`.\n4. If `t1 > 50`, then `t2` is increased by 5 more.\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of increasing `x` when `y` is fixed at a greater value:\n\n- If `y` is fixed and greater than zero, increasing `x` will increase `t1` because `t1 = x * y`.\n- Since `t2 = t1 + 10`, an increase in `t1` will directly result in an increase in `t2`.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the condition `if (t1 > 50)`:\n- If `t1` increases beyond 50 due to the increase in `x`, then `t2` will be further increased by 5.\n- Even if `t1` does not exceed 50, any increase in `t1` will still result in an increase in `t2` because of the `+10` operation.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether `t1` exceeds 50 or not, an increase in `x` will still lead to an increase in `t2` when `y` is fixed and greater than zero.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze the function `calculate` step by step:\n\n1. **Multiplication Step**: `int t1 = x * y;`\n   - Here, `t1` is the product of `x` and `y`.\n\n2. **Addition Step**: `int t2 = t1 + 10;`\n   - `t2` is `t1` plus 10.\n\n3. **Conditional Check**: `if (t1 > 50) { t2 += 5; }`\n   - If `t1` is greater than 50, `t2` gets an additional 5.\n\n4. **Return Statement**: `return t2;`\n   - The final value of `t2` is returned.\n\nNow, let's consider the impact of increasing `x` when `y` is fixed at a greater value:\n\n- **Case 1: \\( t1 \\leq 50 \\)**\n  - In this case, `t2 = t1 + 10`.\n  - Increasing `x` will increase `t1`, which will in turn increase `t2` because `t2` is directly dependent on `t1`.\n\n- **Case 2: \\( t1 > 50 \\)**\n  - Here, `t2 = t1 + 10 + 5 = t1 + 15`.\n  - Increasing `x` will increase `t1`, which will further increase `t2` by more than just 10 due to the additional 5 added when `t1 > 50`.\n\nIn both cases, increasing `x` results in an increase in `t2` when `y` is fixed at a greater value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate` takes two integer inputs `x` and `y`, and returns an integer `t2`.\n\n2. The steps within the function are:\n   - Calculate `t1 = x * y`\n   - Set `t2 = t1 + 10`\n   - If `t1 > 50`, then add 5 to `t2`\n\n3. We need to determine if increasing `x` (with `y` fixed at a greater value) will still result in an increase of `t2`.\n\n4. Let's break down how `t2` is calculated:\n   - Initially, `t2 = t1 + 10`\n   - Since `t1 = x * y`, we can rewrite `t2` as `t2 = x * y + 10`\n   - If `x * y > 50`, then `t2` becomes `t2 = x * y + 15`\n\n5. Consider the case where `x * y <= 50`:\n   - In this case, `t2 = x * y + 10`\n   - Increasing `x` while keeping `y` constant will increase `x * y`, which in turn increases `t2`.\n\n6. Consider the case where `x * y > 50`:\n   - Here, `t2 = x * y + 15`\n   - Increasing `x` while keeping `y` constant will further increase `x * y`, which again increases `t2`.\n\nIn both cases, an increase in `x` leads to an increase in `t2` when `y` is fixed at a greater value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the function**: The function `calculate` takes two integers `x` and `y`, multiplies them to get `t1`, then adds 10 to `t1` to get `t2`.
