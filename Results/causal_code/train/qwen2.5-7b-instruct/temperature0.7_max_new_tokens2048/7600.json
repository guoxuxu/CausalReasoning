    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditions**:\n   - The decision to expand is determined by two conditions:\n     1. `product_success` must be `True`.\n     2. `marketing_effort` must be greater than 5.\n\n2. **Reported Condition**:\n   - The report indicates that expansion was not considered, meaning `decision_to_expand` is `False`.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Decision to Expand**:\n   - For `decision_to_expand` to be `False`, either `product_success` is `False` or `marketing_effort` is less than or equal to 5.\n   - Since we know `decision_to_expand` is `False`, at least one of these conditions must be true.\n\n4. **Determining Marketing Effort**:\n   - If `product_success` were `False`, it would mean that even if `marketing_effort` was greater than 5, the product would still fail.\n   - However, we need to focus on the second condition since we know `decision_to_expand` is `False`.\n   - Therefore, the only way for `decision_to_expand` to be `False` is if `marketing_effort` is less than or equal to 5.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can deduce that the marketing effort was certainly less than or equal to 5 if the report shows that expansion was not considered.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The decision to expand is made using the condition:\n   `decision_to_expand = product_success and (marketing_effort > 5)`\n\n2. For the report to show that expansion was not considered (`decision_to_expand` is False), one of the following must be true:\n   - `product_success` is False (the product did not succeed)\n   - `marketing_effort > 5` is False (the marketing effort is less than or equal to 5)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can deduce that the marketing effort was certainly less than or equal to 5.\n\n4. If `product_success` is False, it doesn't necessarily mean the marketing effort was less than or equal to 5. It just means the product didn't succeed, which could happen even with high marketing effort.\n\n5. However, if `marketing_effort > 5` is False, then `marketing_effort` must indeed be less than or equal to 5.\n\n6. Since the report shows that expansion was not considered, we know that either `product_success` is False OR `marketing_effort > 5` is False.\n\n7. But to definitively conclude that the marketing effort was certainly less than or equal to 5, we would need to know that `product_success` is True (which isn't the case here).\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively deduce that the marketing effort was certainly less than or equal to 5 based solely on the information provided.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Marketing Effort**: This is randomly generated between 1 and 10.\n2. **Success Rate Calculation**: The success rate for the product launch is calculated as `0.1 * marketing_effort`.\n3. **Product Success Simulation**: A random number is compared against the success rate to determine if the product was successful.\n4. **Decision to Expand**: This decision is made based on two conditions:\n   - The product must have been successful (`product_success`).\n   - The marketing effort must have been greater than 5.\n\nThe question asks if we can deduce that the marketing effort was certainly less than or equal to 5 when the report shows that expansion was not considered.\n\n### Reasoning:\n- For the decision to expand to be true, both conditions must be met: the product must succeed, and the marketing effort must be greater than 5.\n- If the report shows that expansion was not considered, it means either the product did not succeed or the marketing effort was not greater than 5.\n- Since the marketing effort is an integer value between 1 and 10, if the condition `marketing_effort > 5` is false, then the marketing effort must be 5 or less.\n\nTherefore, if the report shows that expansion was not considered, we can deduce that the marketing effort was certainly less than or equal to 5.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
