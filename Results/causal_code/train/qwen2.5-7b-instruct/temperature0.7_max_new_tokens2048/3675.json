    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` checks if 'age' is in the data dictionary.\n2.

However, the question specifically asks if we can infer the user's age was at least 18 given that `tax_bracket` is 'high'.\n\nBased on the logic flow of the function, setting `tax_bracket` to 'high' requires the user to be at least 18 (because `is_adult` must be `True`).
