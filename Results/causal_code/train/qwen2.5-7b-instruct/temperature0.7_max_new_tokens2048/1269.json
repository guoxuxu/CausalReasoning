If the heater were off, the maximum possible temperature would still be lower than when the heater is on because even at the highest environmental temperature, subtracting 5 will not reach as high as adding 10.\n\nTherefore, if `check_status` returns 'Too hot', we can conclude that the heater must have been on during the last update.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1.

Therefore, for the current temperature to be greater than the set point (returning 'Too hot'), the only way this can happen is if the heater was on, as turning it off would not increase the temperature enough to exceed the set point.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that if `check_status` returns 'Too hot', the heater must have been on.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Looking at the `update_temperature` method, we see that heat is only added when `heater_on` is True.\n5.
