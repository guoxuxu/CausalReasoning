Let's verify this assumption with the provided list.\n   - The provided `data_list` contains both odd and even numbers (e.g., 4, 2, 6).\n\n4. **Assumption Check**:\n   - Since the provided list includes even numbers, the assumption that `data_list` consists only of odd numbers is false.\n\n5. **Implication**:\n   - Given that `data_list` contains even numbers, the function will append `d + 1` for even `d`, which results in odd numbers in the `result` list.\n   - Therefore, if `data_list` contains even numbers, `final_result` cannot be guaranteed to contain only even numbers.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
