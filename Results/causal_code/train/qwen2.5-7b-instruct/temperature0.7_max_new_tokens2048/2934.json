  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The number of students is a direct function of the number of teachers, with each teacher being responsible for 30 students. If the number of teachers increases, the number of students automatically increases due to the multiplier effect set in the __init__ and open_new_section methods.",
  "causal_map": "number_of_teachers → number_of_students; additional_teachers → number_of_students",
  "causal_map_integration": "An increase in the number of teachers leads to an increase in the number of students, as each teacher is associated with 30 students.",

    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The `School` class is defined with an `__init__` method that initializes the number of teachers and calculates the number of students as three times the number of teachers.\n\n2. There is another method `open_new_section` which takes an argument `additional_teachers`. This method increases the number of teachers by the value of `additional_teachers`.\n\n3. For each teacher added, the number of students is increased by 30 (since the initial calculation was based on 30 students per teacher).\n\n4. Therefore, if the number of teachers increases, the `open_new_section` method will directly increase the number of students by 30 for each additional teacher.\n\nBased on this analysis, if the number of teachers increases, the number of students will indeed also increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The `School` class is defined with an initializer (`__init__`) that takes the number of teachers as input. Based on this, the initial number of students is calculated as three times the number of teachers.\n\n2. **Adding Teachers**: The `open_new_section` method allows for adding more teachers to the school. For each additional teacher added, the number of teachers is increased by that amount.\n\n3. **Impact on Students**: When new teachers are added using the `open_new_section` method, the number of students is also increased. Specifically, for each additional teacher, the number of students increases by 30 (since the ratio is 1 teacher to 30 students).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, if the number of teachers increases, the number of students will also increase proportionally, as the relationship between the number of teachers and students is directly proportional (30 students per teacher).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The `School` class is initialized with a certain number of teachers (`number_of_teachers`).\n   - The number of students is calculated as three times the number of teachers (`self.number_of_students = number_of_teachers * 30`).\n\n2. **Effect of Increasing Teachers**:\n   - When the method `open_new_section` is called with an additional number of teachers (`additional_teachers`), the number of teachers increases.\n   - As a result, the number of students also increases because the number of students is directly proportional to the number of teachers (`self.number_of_students += additional_teachers * 30`).\n\n3. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - The relationship between the number of teachers and the number of students is direct and proportional.\n   - Similarly, the addition of more teachers (through `open_new_section`) leads to an increase in the number of students.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that if the number of teachers increases, the number of students will also increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `School` class is defined with two attributes: `number_of_teachers` and `number_of_students`.\n\n2. The `__init__` method initializes the number of students based on the number of teachers:\n   - `self.number_of_students = number_of_teachers * 30`\n\n3. The `open_new_section` method modifies these attributes:\n   - It increases the number of teachers by `additional_teachers`\n   - It increases the number of students by `additional_teachers * 30`\n\n4. From the given causal relationships:\n   - `number_of_teachers → number_of_students`: This is true because the initial number of students is set based on the number of teachers.\n   - `additional_teachers → number_of_students`: This is also true because when additional teachers are added, the number of students increases proportionally.\n\n5. Therefore, if the number of teachers increases (either initially or due to opening new sections), the number of students will also increase.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `School` class is defined with two attributes: `number_of_teachers` and `number_of_students`.\n\n2. The relationship between these attributes is established in the constructor (`__init__` method):\n   - `self.number_of_students = self.number_of_teachers * 30`\n   This means that the number of students is directly proportional to the number of teachers, with each teacher corresponding to 30 students.\n\n3. There is another method called `open_new_section` which modifies both `number_of_teachers` and `number_of_students`:\n   - `self.number_of_teachers += additional_teachers`\n   - `self.number_of_students += additional_teachers * 30`\n   This method increases the number of teachers by `additional_teachers` and consequently increases the number of students by `additional_teachers * 30`.\n\n4. From the above points, we can see that:\n   - When `number_of_teachers` increases, `number_of_students` increases proportionally.\n   - Similarly, when `additional_teachers` (which can be seen as an indirect way of increasing `number_of_teachers`) increases, `number_of_students` also increases.\n\n5.
