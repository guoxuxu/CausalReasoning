  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Calling heatUp() increases temperature and consequently calls updateHumidity(), which adjusts humidity based on the new temperature. This showcases a causal relationship from cause (heatUp activation) to effect (humidity level changes) without direct intervention in humidity.",
  "causal_map": "this.temperature → this.humidity; this.temperature → this.humidity",
  "causal_map_integration": "When heatUp() is called, the temperature increases, which then affects the humidity by setting it to 60 if the temperature is greater than 25, otherwise to 40.",

    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `WeatherController` class has methods to control temperature and humidity.\n2.

The `updateHumidity()` method:\n   - Checks if the temperature is greater than 25.\n   - If true, sets humidity to 60.\n   - Otherwise, sets humidity to 40.\n\n4.
