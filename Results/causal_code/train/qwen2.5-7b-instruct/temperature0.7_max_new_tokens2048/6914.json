    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The car object is initialized with `engine_status` as `False` and `fuel_level` as `100`.\n\n2. **Starting the Engine**:\n   - The method `start_engine()` checks if `fuel_level > 0`. If true, it sets `engine_status` to `True`.\n   \n3. **Driving**:\n   - The method `drive(hours)` consumes fuel at a rate of `10 * hours` per hour.\n   - If driving causes the fuel level to drop to `0` or below, `engine_status` is set to `False`.\n\n4. **Fuel Refueling**:\n   - The method `refuel(fuel)` increases the `fuel_level` up to a maximum of `100`.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"If the engine is running, does this imply that the fuel level was greater than 0 before starting the engine?\"\n\n- For the engine to be running (`engine_status = True`), the condition `fuel_level > 0` must have been met during the call to `start_engine()`.\n- If `fuel_level` were not greater than 0 when trying to start the engine, `engine_status` would remain `False`.\n\nTherefore, if the engine is currently running, it logically follows that the fuel level was indeed greater than 0 before starting the engine.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

However, the problem statement doesn't provide any direct information about what happens to `fuel_level` after the engine starts and drives.\n5. We need to focus on the initial condition for starting the engine: `fuel_level > 0` must be true for the engine to start.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that for the engine to be running (i.e., `engine_status = True`), it must have been the case that `fuel_level > 0` before starting the engine.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

However, once the engine starts (`engine_status = True`), there's no immediate guarantee that the fuel level will remain above 0.\n\n4. The `drive` method reduces the fuel level over time while the engine is running, and if it reaches 0 or below, both the engine status and fuel level are set to 0.\n\n5. So, the engine running does not necessarily mean the fuel level was greater than 0 before starting the engine.
