    "Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. The `dailySteps` variable is set directly to 10000 by an external method.\n2. Then, the `updateSteps(0)` method is called.\n\nNow let's analyze what happens in the `updateSteps` method:\n\n- The method takes an integer parameter `steps` and adds it to `dailySteps`.\n- In this case, `steps` is 0, so `dailySteps` remains unchanged at 10000.\n- The condition `if (dailySteps >= 10000)` is checked.\n- Since `dailySteps` is exactly 10000, the condition is true.\n- Therefore, `reachedGoal` is set to `true`.\n\nSo, after calling `updateSteps(0)` following the direct assignment of `dailySteps` to 10000, `reachedGoal` will indeed become `true`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthApp` class has two key attributes:\n   - `dailySteps`: An integer that tracks the number of steps taken.\n   - `reachedGoal`: A boolean that indicates whether the goal has been reached.\n\n2. The `updateSteps(int steps)` method:\n   - Adds the given number of steps to `dailySteps`.\n   - Checks if `dailySteps` is greater than or equal to 10000.\n   - Sets `reachedGoal` to true if the condition is met; otherwise, it remains false.\n\n3. The scenario described:\n   - An external method sets `dailySteps` directly to 10000.\n   - Then, `updateSteps(0)` is called.\n\n4. Analysis:\n   - When `dailySteps` is set directly to 10000 externally, `reachedGoal` is not updated at this point because the `updateSteps` method hasn't been called yet.\n   - When `updateSteps(0)` is called:\n     - It adds 0 steps to `dailySteps`, so `dailySteps` remains 10000.\n     - Since `dailySteps` is still 10000, the condition `if (dailySteps >= 10000)` is true.\n     - Therefore, `reachedGoal` is set to true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The `hasReachedGoal()` method simply returns the value of `reachedGoal`.\n\n4.
