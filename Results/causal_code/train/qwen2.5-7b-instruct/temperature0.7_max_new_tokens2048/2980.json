    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discount` takes two parameters: `price` and `is_member`.\n2. If `is_member` is `True`, the discount applied is 20% (0.2).\n3. If `is_member` is `False`, the discount applied is 10% (0.1).\n4. The final price is calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n5. We are setting `is_member` to `True` and the initial `price` to 100.\n6. Since `is_member` is `True`, the discount applied will be 20%.\n7. Therefore, the calculation for the final price (`final_price`) would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{final\\_price} = 100 \\times (1 - 0.2) = 100 \\times 0.8 = 80\n   \\]\n\nGiven that the discount is exactly 20%, the final price will be exactly 80.\n\nThus, the answer to the question \"If we programmatically set the is_member variable to True, will this guarantee a discounted_price of no more than 80?\" is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
