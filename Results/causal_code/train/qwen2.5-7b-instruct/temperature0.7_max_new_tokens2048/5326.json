    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. It initializes `processed` to `10 * data['value']`.\n3. If `data['flag']` is `True`, it adds 100 to `processed`.\n4. If `data['flag']` is `False`, it subtracts 50 from `processed`.\n\nGiven that `data['value']` is always modified to be 10, we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\n- `processed = 10 * 10 = 100`\n- If `data['flag']` is `True`: `processed = 100 + 100 = 200`\n- If `data['flag']` is `False`: `processed = 100 - 50 = 50`\n\nSince `processed` is significantly higher than 100, the only scenario where this happens is when `processed = 200`. This occurs if `data['flag']` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, if `processed` is significantly higher than 100, we can infer that `flag` was `True`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
