    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_scores` calculates the total score by summing up the values of 'math', 'physics', and 'literature'.\n\n2. The formula for the total is:\n   `data['total'] = data['math'] + data['physics'] + data['literature']`\n\n3. If we increase the 'math' score:\n   - The 'physics' and 'literature' scores remain unchanged.\n   - Since all three scores are being added together, increasing any one of them (in this case, 'math') will result in an increase in the total score.\n\n4. Therefore, if the 'math' score increases, the 'total' score will definitely increase because it directly contributes to the sum that forms the 'total'.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_scores` takes a dictionary `data` as input.\n2. It calculates the total score by summing up the values of 'math', 'physics', and 'literature'.\n3. The 'total' is then stored back into the dictionary under the key 'total'.\n4. The decision on whether to set 'admission' to 'Yes' or 'No' is based solely on the value of 'total', not on the individual scores.\n\nNow, considering the specific question:\n- If the 'math' score increases, will the 'total' score necessarily increase?\n\nTo answer this, let's consider the following:\n- The 'total' score is the sum of three individual scores ('math', 'physics', 'literature').\n- Increasing the 'math' score directly adds to the total sum.\n- There are no conditions in the function that would subtract from or negate the increase in 'math'.\n\nTherefore, if the 'math' score increases, the 'total' score will also increase, unless the 'physics' and 'literature' scores decrease by exactly the same amount, which is not a general condition.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the 'total' score will indeed necessarily increase when the 'math' score increases.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If the total score is greater than 240, it sets 'admission' to 'Yes'; otherwise, it sets 'admission' to 'No'.\n4. The question specifically asks if increasing the 'math' score will necessarily increase the 'total' score.\n\nNow, let's consider the impact of increasing the 'math' score:\n\n- The 'math' score is one of the components that contribute to the 'total' score.\n- If we increase the 'math' score, we are directly adding more points to the sum that calculates 'total'.\n- Since 'total' is the sum of 'math', 'physics', and 'literature', an increase in any of these scores will result in an increase in 'total'.\n\nTherefore, if the 'math' score increases, the 'total' score will necessarily increase because 'math' is a direct component of the 'total' calculation.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
