    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_discounted_price` takes three parameters: `price`, `discount`, and `is_member`.\n\n2. If `is_member` is `True`, the function adds an additional 0.05 to the `discount`.\n\n3. The `discounted_price` is then calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n\n4. Given the values:\n   - `price = 100`\n   - `is_member = True`\n   - `received_discount = 0.10`\n\n5. Since `is_member` is `True`, the actual discount used in the calculation would be `0.10 + 0.05 = 0.15`.\n\n6. The `discounted_price` would be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   100 \\times (1 - 0.15) = 100 \\times 0.85 = 85\n   \\]\n\n7. Now, if we consider `is_member` being `False`, no additional 0.05 would be added to the `received_discount`.\n\n8. The `discounted_price` would then be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   100 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 100 \\times 0.90 = 90\n   \\]\n\n9. Comparing the two scenarios:\n   - When `is_member` is `True`, the `discounted_price` is 85.\n   - When `is_member` is `False`, the `discounted_price` is 90.\n\n10. If the `discounted_price` is found to be higher than expected, it indicates that the `discounted_price` is 90, which means `is_member` must have been `False`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Function Logic**:\n   - The function `compute_discounted_price` takes three parameters: `price`, `discount`, and `is_member`.\n   - If `is_member` is `True`, an additional 5% discount is applied.\n   - The final discounted price is calculated as `price * (1 - discount)`.\n\n2. **Given Values**:\n   - `price = 100`\n   - `is_member = True`\n   - `received_discount = 0.10` (This is passed as the `discount` parameter)\n\n3. **Expected Behavior with `is_member = True`**:\n   - Since `is_member` is `True`, an additional 5% is added to the `received_discount`.\n   - Therefore, the effective discount is `0.10 + 0.05 = 0.15`.\n   - The calculation becomes: `100 * (1 - 0.15) = 100 * 0.85 = 85`.\n\n4. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - If the `discounted_price` is found to be higher than expected (e.g., higher than 85), it would suggest that the logic did not add the extra 5% discount for members.\n   - This could happen if `is_member` was mistakenly set to `False`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If `is_member` was set to `False`, no additional 5% discount would be added, and the final discounted price would simply be `100 * (1 - 0.10) = 100 * 0.90 = 90`.\n   - A price of 90 is higher than the expected 85 when `is_member` is `True`.\n\nTherefore, if the `discounted_price` is found to be higher than expected, it indeed indicates that `is_member` was likely set to `False`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
