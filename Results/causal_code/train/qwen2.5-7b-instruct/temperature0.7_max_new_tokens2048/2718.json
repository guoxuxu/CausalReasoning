    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `HealthTracker` class is initialized with `daily_water_intake` set to 0 liters and `daily_calories_burned` set to 0 calories.\n\n2. **Method `drink_water`**:\n   - This method takes an argument `liters` which represents the amount of water (in liters) consumed.\n   - It adds the passed value to `self.daily_water_intake`.\n   - If `self.daily_water_intake` becomes greater than 2 liters, it calls the `feel_hydrated` method.\n\n3. **Method `feel_hydrated`**:\n   - This method sets the `is_hydrated` flag to `True`.\n\n4. **Calling `drink_water` with 3 liters**:\n   - When `drink_water(3)` is called, `self.daily_water_intake` will be incremented from 0 to 3 liters.\n   - Since 3 liters is greater than 2 liters, the condition `if self.daily_water_intake > 2:` is satisfied.\n   - As a result, the `feel_hydrated` method is invoked.\n\n5. **Setting the `is_hydrated` flag**:\n   - The `feel_hydrated` method sets `self.is_hydrated` to `True`.\n\nTherefore, after calling `drink_water(3)`, the `is_hydrated` flag will indeed be set to `True`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

We add 3 liters to `daily_water_intake`, making it 3 liters.\n3. Since 3 liters is greater than 2 liters, the condition `if self.daily_water_intake > 2:` is satisfied.\n4.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `HealthTracker` class has a method `drink_water` which takes a parameter `liters`.\n2.

Inside the `drink_water` method:\n   - The `daily_water_intake` attribute is incremented by the amount of water consumed.\n   - If `daily_water_intake` exceeds 2 liters, the `feel_hydrated` method is called.\n\n4. The `feel_hydrated` method sets the `is_hydrated` flag to `True`.\n\n5. In the given scenario, we call the `drink_water` method with 3 liters of water.\n\n6. Since 3 liters is greater than 2 liters, the condition in the `if` statement is satisfied.\n\n7.
