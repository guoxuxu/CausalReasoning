  "Question Type": "from effect to cause with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Since applyColdFront() affects only the temperature and doesn't alter the cloudiness of the weather, a false return after lowering the temperature still doesn’t provide information about the original state of cloudiness. It just implies not all conditions (either not cloudy or temperature not low enough even after decrease) for rain were met.",

  "causal_map_integration": "isCloudy and temperature directly influence willItRain. Applying a cold front decreases temperature. If willItRain() returns false after applying a cold front, it does not necessarily mean it was originally cloudy because the condition for rain (isCloudy and temperature < 20) did not meet even after the temperature decrease.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `willItRain()` method checks two conditions:\n   - It must be cloudy (`isCloudy`).\n   - The temperature must be less than 20.\n\n2. The `applyColdFront()` method decreases the temperature by 5 degrees.\n\n3. We need to determine if `willItRain()` returning false after applying `applyColdFront()` means it was originally cloudy.\n\n4. For `willItRain()` to return false after the temperature decrease:\n   - Either it was not cloudy originally.\n   - Or it was cloudy but the temperature was at least 20 before the decrease, so it became 15 or higher after the decrease.\n\n5. If it was originally cloudy and the temperature was 20 or above, then after applying `applyColdFront()`, the temperature would still be 15 or above, making `willItRain()` return false.\n\n6. However, if it was not cloudy originally, `willItRain()` would always return false regardless of the temperature.\n\n7. Therefore, `willItRain()` returning false after the temperature decrease does not necessarily mean it was originally cloudy.

If `willItRain()` returned false, and considering the method logic, it means at least one of the conditions was not met:\n   - It could be that `isCloudy` was false.\n   - Or `isCloudy` was true but the temperature was raised above 20 after the decrease.\n\n6.
