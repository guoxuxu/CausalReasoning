  "Explanation": "As raw_input decreases, processed_input, which is calculated as double the raw_input, decreases as well. Since analyze_data returns 'Low' for any input less than or equal to 20, a decreased raw_input that leads to a processed_input of 20 or less will change final_result to 'Low'.",
