    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TemperatureController` class has an attribute `temperature` initialized to 20 degrees Celsius.\n2. The `heater_on` attribute is initialized to False, but it can be toggled using the `toggle_heater` method.\n3. The `update_temperature` method is responsible for adjusting the temperature based on various factors:\n   - If `heater_override` is provided and is True, the temperature increases by 3 degrees.\n   - If `heater_override` is provided and is False, the temperature decreases by 1 degree.\n   - If `heater_override` is not provided (i.e., the method is called with only the external temperature), and `heater_on` is True, the temperature increases by 2 degrees.\n   - If `heater_on` is False, the temperature decreases by 0.5 degrees.\n4. The method also adjusts the temperature based on the external temperature:\n   - If the external temperature is below 0, the indoor temperature decreases by 2 degrees.\n   - If the external temperature is above 30, the indoor temperature increases by 1 degree.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `heater_on` is set to True without any external temperature change or override:\n\n- Since no `heater_override` is provided and `heater_on` is True, the first condition in the `update_temperature` method that applies is the one where `heater_on` is True.\n- This condition states that the temperature should increase by 2 degrees.\n\nTherefore, if `heater_on` is set to True without any external temperature change or override, the indoor temperature will indeed increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `TemperatureController` instance is initialized with `temperature = 20` and `heater_on = False`.\n\n2. **Toggle Heater**: We are told that `heater_on` is set to `True`. This means the heater will be turned on.\n\n3. **Update Temperature Method**:\n   - When `heater_override` is `None`, it checks if `heater_on` is `True`.\n   - If `heater_on` is `True`, the temperature increases by 2 degrees Celsius (`self.temperature += 2`).\n\n4. **External Temperature Factors**: In this scenario, there is no mention of any external temperature change or adjustment, so we can ignore the external temperature factors for now.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: Since `heater_on` is being set to `True` and there are no other factors affecting the temperature, the temperature will increase by 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the indoor temperature will indeed increase when `heater_on` is set to `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `TemperatureController` instance is created with `self.temperature = 20` and `self.heater_on = False`.\n\n2. **Heater Toggle**: We call `toggle_heater()` which sets `self.heater_on` to `True`.\n\n3. **Update Temperature Method**: If we then call `update_temperature(external_temp)` where `external_temp` does not trigger any special adjustments (i.e., it's not below 0 or above 30), the method will execute as follows:\n   - Since `heater_override` is `None`, the method checks `self.heater_on`.\n   - Because `self.heater_on` is now `True`, the method increases the temperature by 2 degrees.\n\n4. **Final Temperature Calculation**: The new temperature would be `20 + 2 = 22`.\n\nTherefore, if `heater_on` is set to `True` and there are no external temperature changes or overrides, the indoor temperature will indeed increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `TemperatureController` object is created with `temperature = 20` and `heater_on = False`.\n\n2. **Heater Activation**: The `toggle_heater` method is called to set `heater_on` to `True`.\n\n3. **Update Temperature Method**:\n   - Since `heater_override` is `None`, the `update_temperature` method checks the current state of `heater_on`.\n   - With `heater_on` being `True`, the code inside the `if self.heater_on:` block is executed.\n   - This block increases the temperature by 2 degrees Celsius.\n\n4. **Adjustments Based on External Temperature**:\n   - There is no mention of an external temperature in the problem statement, so we assume there is no change due to external conditions (no `external_temp` provided).\n\n5. **Final Adjustment**:\n   - No additional adjustments are made to the temperature after the initial increase.\n\nGiven these steps, the indoor temperature will indeed increase by 2 degrees Celsius when the heater is turned on.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - The default room temperature is set to 20°C.\n   - `heater_on` is initially False.\n\n2. **Toggle Heater**:\n   - We are told that `heater_on` is set to True, which means the heater is turned on.\n\n3. **Update Temperature Method**:\n   - When the `update_temperature` method is called with no external temperature change or override (`heater_override=None`), it checks the current state of `heater_on`.\n   - Since `heater_on` is now True, the method will add 2 degrees to the current temperature.\n\n4. **Current Temperature**:\n   - The initial temperature is 20°C.\n   - Adding 2 degrees due to the heater being on results in a new temperature of 22°C.\n\n5. **Adjustments Based on External Temperature**:\n   - There is no mention of any external temperature changes that would affect the temperature further.\n   - Therefore, no additional adjustments are made based on external temperatures.\n\n6. **Final Temperature**:\n   - The final temperature after toggling the heater on and updating the temperature is 22°C.\n\nSince the initial temperature was 20°C and it increased to 22°C when the heater was turned on, the indoor temperature does indeed increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
