  "Explanation": "In the given code, 'y' is directly dependent on 'x', which itself is a product of 'data' multiplied by 5. As the 'data' increases, 'x' increases linearly, and so does 'y' because 10 is just a constant addition, making the relationship between 'data' and 'y' also a linear increase without any intervention needed.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` takes an input `data`.\n2. It multiplies `data` by 5 to get `x`.\n3. Then it adds 10 to `x` to get `y`.\n4. If `y` is greater than 50, `z` is set to True; otherwise, `z` is set to False.\n5. We need to determine if increasing the input `data` will definitely result in an increase in the value of `y`.\n\nLet's analyze what happens when we increase the input `data`:\n\n- If `data` increases, then `x` (which is `data * 5`) will also increase.\n- Since `y` is `x + 10`, and `x` has increased, `y` will also increase.\n\nTherefore, increasing the input `data` will definitely lead to an increase in the value of `y`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the function `process_data` step by step:\n\n1. The function takes an input `data`.\n2. It calculates `x` as `data * 5`.\n3. It then calculates `y` as `x + 10`, which simplifies to `data * 5 + 10`.\n4. It checks if `y` is greater than 50.\n5. If `y > 50`, it sets `z` to `True`; otherwise, it sets `z` to `False`.\n\nThe key part here is the calculation of `y`. `y` is directly dependent on `data` through the formula `y = data * 5 + 10`.\n\nTo determine if `y` will definitely increase when `data` is increased, we need to consider the relationship between `data` and `y`:\n\n- When `data` increases, `data * 5` also increases proportionally.\n- Adding 10 to this result (which is `data * 5`) will always result in a higher value for `y`.\n\nTherefore, increasing `data` will always lead to an increase in `y`, assuming no other factors change.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
