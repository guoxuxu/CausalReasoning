    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - Store hours are initially 6 hours.\n   - Advertising budget is not specified, so we'll consider it as an unknown variable 'b'.\n\n2. **Initial Sales Calculation:**\n   - Since store hours are 6, which is less than or equal to 8, the initial sales calculation is:\n     ```python\n     sales = 50\n     ```\n   - If the advertising budget (b) is greater than 500, the sales would be:\n     ```python\n     sales *= 1.5\n     ```\n\n3. **Change in Store Hours:**\n   - The store hours are increased from 6 to 10 hours.\n   - Now, since store hours are 10, which is greater than 8, the new sales calculation is:\n     ```python\n     sales = 100\n     ```\n   - If the advertising budget (b) is greater than 500, the sales would be:\n     ```python\n     sales *= 1.5\n     ```\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - Initially, sales were at least 50 (possibly higher if the advertising budget was over 500).\n   - After increasing store hours to 10, sales are fixed at 100 regardless of the advertising budget.\n\nSince the initial sales could have been lower than 100 (at least 50), and after increasing the store hours, the sales are fixed at 100, there will indeed be an increase in sales.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - Store hours: 6 hours\n   - Advertising budget: Let's assume it's `x` (we don't know the exact value, but we'll consider its impact later).\n\n2. **Initial Sales Calculation:**\n   - Since the store hours are 6, which is less than 8, the initial sales calculation is:\n     ```python\n     sales = 50\n     ```\n   - If the advertising budget `x` is greater than 500, the sales would be multiplied by 1.5:\n     ```python\n     sales *= 1.5\n     ```\n\n3. **New Conditions:**\n   - Store hours are increased to 10 hours.\n   - The advertising budget cannot be modified.\n\n4. **New Sales Calculation with Increased Store Hours:**\n   - With 10 hours, the condition `store_hours > 8` is now true, so the sales calculation changes to:\n     ```python\n     sales = 100\n     ```\n   - The advertising budget condition remains unchanged, so if `x > 500`, the sales would still be:\n     ```python\n     sales *= 1.5\n     ```\n\n5. **Comparison:**\n   - Initially, sales could have been 50 or 75 (if the advertising budget was over 500).\n   - Now, the sales are fixed at 100 (if the advertising budget remains the same).\n\nGiven that the initial sales could have been up to 75 and now they are 100, there will indeed be an increase in sales.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions (Store Hours = 6, Advertising Budget not specified):**\n   - Since `store_hours` is 6, which is less than or equal to 8, the initial sales prediction is `sales = 50`.\n   - The advertising budget is not specified, so no additional adjustment is made based on the advertising budget.\n\n2. **New Conditions (Store Hours = 10, Advertising Budget remains unchanged):**\n   - Now, `store_hours` is increased to 10, which is greater than 8.\n   - According to the function, when `store_hours` > 8, `sales` is set to 100.\n   - If the advertising budget was initially below 500, it remains below 500 after the change since modifying the advertising budget is prohibited. Therefore, the sales prediction does not get multiplied by 1.5.\n\n3. **Sales Comparison:**\n   - Initially, with `store_hours` = 6, the sales prediction was 50.\n   - With `store_hours` = 10, the sales prediction becomes 100.\n   \nSince 100 is greater than 50, there will indeed be an increase in sales.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

This means the advertising budget cannot change during this scenario.\n\n5. **Final Sales Calculation:**\n   - Since the advertising budget cannot change, the multiplier for the sales (based on the advertising budget) does not apply.\n   - Therefore, the sales remain at 100.\n\n6. **Comparison:**\n   - Initial sales with 6 hours of store operation were 50.\n   - Final sales with 10 hours of store operation are 100.\n   - There is indeed an increase in sales from 50 to 100.\n\nGiven these steps, the sales do increase when the store hours are increased from 6 to 10, under the constraint that the advertising budget remains unchanged.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
