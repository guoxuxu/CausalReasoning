    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `resetWeather` method sets both `cloudy` and `rain` to false.\n2. When `resetWeather` is called, the following happens:\n   - `cloudy = false;`\n   - `rain = false;`\n\n3. After `resetWeather` is called, `cloudy` is false and `rain` is false.\n\n4. Then, the `setCloudy` method is called with the argument `true`.\n5. Inside `setCloudy`, there are two actions:\n   - `cloudy = state;` which sets `cloudy` to true.\n   - If `cloudy` is true, it sets `rain` to true. Since `cloudy` is now true, this condition is met and `rain` is set to true.\n\n6. After calling `setCloudy(true)`, `cloudy` is true and `rain` is true.\n\n7. Finally, we call `checkRain()`, which returns the value of `rain`.\n\nSince `rain` is true after these operations, `checkRain()` will return true.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
