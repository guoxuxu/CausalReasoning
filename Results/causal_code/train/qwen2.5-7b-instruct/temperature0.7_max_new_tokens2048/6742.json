    "Let's break down the logic of the function `compute_metrics` to determine if an increase in sales figures will result in an increase in the `new_metric` when the `use_extra_feature` parameter is set to `False`.\n\n1. **Function Logic with `use_extra_feature=False`:**\n   - The function calculates `data['new_metric']` based solely on `data['sales']`.\n   - The formula for `new_metric` is: \n     ```\n     data['new_metric'] = data['sales'] * 0.1\n     ```\n\n2. **Analysis of the Formula:**\n   - The `new_metric` is directly proportional to the `sales` figure.\n   - The coefficient (0.1) is a positive constant.\n\n3. **Impact of Increasing Sales:**\n   - If the `sales` figure increases, multiplying it by 0.1 will also result in an increase in the `new_metric`.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Yes, if the sales figures increase, the `new_metric` will also increase when `use_extra_feature` is set to `False`.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_metrics` computes a new metric based on the input data and an optional flag `use_extra_feature`.\n\n2. If `use_extra_feature` is False (which is the case we're considering), the new metric is calculated as:\n   `data['new_metric'] = data['sales'] * 0.1`\n\n3. This equation shows that the new metric is directly proportional to the 'sales' column in the data. \n\n4. When sales figures increase, the value of `data['sales'] * 0.1` will also increase because:\n   - Sales figures are multiplied by 0.1 (a positive constant)\n   - Multiplying a larger number by a positive constant results in a larger product\n\n5. Since the new metric is the sum of these individual new metric values for each row in the dataset, and each of these values increases with higher sales, the overall sum (i.e., the new metric) will also increase.\n\nTherefore, if the sales figures increase, the new_metric will also increase without using the extra feature.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If `use_extra_feature` is `False`, the 'new_metric' is calculated as:\n   - `data['new_metric'] = data['sales'] * 0.1`\n\n3. This means that for each row of data, the 'new_metric' is simply 10% of the 'sales' value.\n\n4. If the sales figures increase, then 10% of those increased sales figures will also increase.\n\n5. Since there is no other factor (like 'returns') being considered in the calculation when `use_extra_feature` is `False`, the only component affecting 'new_metric' is 'sales'.\n\n6. Therefore, an increase in 'sales' directly leads to an increase in 'new_metric'.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `compute_metrics` takes two parameters - `data`, which is expected to be a DataFrame containing at least 'sales' and 'returns' columns, and `use_extra_feature`, a boolean that determines whether an additional calculation should be applied.\n\n2. **Calculation of `new_metric`**:\n   - If `use_extra_feature` is `False`: \n     - The `new_metric` is calculated as `sales * 0.1`.\n   - If `use_extra_feature` is `True`: \n     - The `new_metric` is calculated as `(sales * 0.1) + (returns * 0.05)`.\n\n3. **Question Focus**: We need to determine if the `new_metric` will increase when the `sales` figures increase, assuming we do not use the extra feature.\n\n4. **Analysis Without Extra Feature**:\n   - When `use_extra_feature` is `False`, the formula for `new_metric` simplifies to `data['sales'] * 0.1`.\n   - This means that `new_metric` is directly proportional to `sales`. \n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since `new_metric` is directly proportional to `sales`, any increase in `sales` will result in an increase in `new_metric`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
