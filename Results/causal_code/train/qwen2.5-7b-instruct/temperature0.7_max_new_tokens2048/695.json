  "Explanation": "The `reviewPerformance` function is the causal mechanism for changing John's salary, as it conditions salary adjustments (i.e., 10% increase) on the performance rating being over 80. Preventing this review would mean this condition is never checked or met, thus leaving his salary unchanged.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an `Employee` class with properties `name`, `performanceRating`, and `salary`. The `updateSalary` method increases the salary based on a percentage increase.\n\n2. **John's Initial Details**: \n   - Name: 'John Doe'\n   - Performance Rating: 85\n   - Salary: 50,000\n\n3. **Review Function (`reviewPerformance`)**:\n   - Checks if the performance rating is greater than 80.\n   - If true, it increases the performance rating by 5 and applies a 10% salary increase.\n   - If false, it increases the performance rating by 2.\n   - Ensures the new performance rating does not exceed 100.\n\n4. **Applying the Review to John**:\n   - Since John's performance rating is 85, which is greater than 80, the function will increase his performance rating by 5.\n   - New performance rating: 85 + 5 = 90.\n   - The function will then call `updateSalary` with a 10% increase.\n   - New salary: 50,000 + (50,000 * 10%) = 50,000 + 5,000 = 55,000.\n\n5. **Preventing the Review**:\n   - If we do not call the `reviewPerformance` function, John's performance rating and salary will remain as they were initially.\n\nGiven these steps, if we prevent the review, John's salary will indeed remain unchanged at 50,000.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic to determine if John's salary will change after the performance review.\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - John's initial performance rating is 85.\n   - John's initial salary is 50,000.\n\n2. **Review Performance Function**:\n   - The `reviewPerformance` function checks if the employee's current performance rating is greater than 80.\n   - If true, it increases the performance rating by 5 points and applies a 10% salary increase.\n   - If false, it increases the performance rating by 2 points.\n\n3. **Condition Check**:\n   - Since John's performance rating is 85 (which is greater than 80), the condition inside the `if` block will be true.\n\n4. **Salary Increase**:\n   - The performance rating for John is increased by 5 points, making it 90.\n   - The salary is then updated with a 10% increase. \n     - Calculation: \\( 50000 \\times 1.10 = 55000 \\).\n\n5. **Final Performance Rating**:\n   - The new performance rating (90) is set as the employee's new performance rating.\n\nGiven that the `reviewPerformance` function explicitly updates the salary when the performance rating is above 80, and since John's initial rating was 85, his salary will indeed increase to 55,000.\n\nIf we prevent this review, the salary will not undergo the 10% increase, and therefore, it will remain at the original value of 50,000.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We have an `Employee` class with properties `name`, `performanceRating`, and `salary`.\n   - An instance `john` is created with `name = 'John Doe'`, `performanceRating = 85`, and `salary = 50000`.\n\n2. **Review Function (`reviewPerformance`)**:\n   - This function takes an `employee` as input.\n   - It checks if the `performanceRating` is greater than 80.\n     - If true, it increases the `performanceRating` by 5 and updates the salary by 10%.\n     - If false, it increases the `performanceRating` by 2.\n\n3. **Current Behavior**:\n   - For `john`:\n     - Since `performanceRating = 85` (which is > 80), the function will:\n       - Increase `performanceRating` to 90.\n       - Call `updateSalary(10)` which increases the salary by 10%.\n\n4. **Effect on Salary**:\n   - The initial salary of `john` is 50000.\n   - After the review, the salary becomes \\( 50000 + 50000 \\times 10\\% = 50000 + 5000 = 55000 \\).\n\n5. **Preventing the Review**:\n   - If the review is prevented, the `performanceRating` remains at 85, and the salary does not change from its initial value of 50000.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - If the review is prevented, `john`'s salary will remain unchanged at 50000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the logic to determine if John's salary will change without the performance review.\n\n1. **Initial State**: \n   - John Doe has a performance rating of 85 and a salary of 50,000.\n\n2. **Review Performance Function**:\n   - The function `reviewPerformance` checks if the employee's performance rating is greater than 80.\n   - If true, it increases the performance rating by 5 and applies a 10% salary increase.\n   - If false, it increases the performance rating by 2.\n   - It then caps the performance rating at 100 using `Math.min`.\n\n3. **Applying the Review to John**:\n   - Since John's initial performance rating is 85 (which is greater than 80), the function will execute the following steps:\n     - Increase performance rating by 5: 85 + 5 = 90.\n     - Apply a 10% salary increase: 50,000 + (50,000 * 10 / 100) = 50,000 + 5,000 = 55,000.\n     - Cap the performance rating at 100 (though it remains 90 as it's already below 100).\n\n4. **Preventing the Review**:\n   - If the review does not occur, none of these changes happen.\n   - Therefore, John's salary remains at 50,000.\n\nBased on this analysis, if the performance review is prevented, John's salary will indeed remain unchanged.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
