    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `BankAccount` class has a method `add_monthly_interest` that calculates and adds interest to the account balance.\n2. The formula used is: `self.balance += self.balance * (rate / 100)`\n3. If the interest rate (`rate`) is set to 0, then the calculation becomes: `self.balance += self.balance * (0 / 100)`\n4. Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses gives: `self.balance += self.balance * 0`\n5. Multiplying any number by 0 results in 0, so the entire expression simplifies to: `self.balance += 0`\n6. Adding 0 to any value does not change that value.\n\nTherefore, if the interest rate is set to 0, adding monthly interest will not affect the balance.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

For the current balance of 117.5 (after deposits and withdrawal), the calculation would be:\n   117.5 * (5 / 100) = 117.5 * 0.05 = 5.875\n4.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `add_monthly_interest` method is called on the `account` object.\n\n2. This method takes a rate as an argument, which is passed when the method is called.\n\n3. The current call to `add_monthly_interest` uses a rate of 5%.\n\n4. The method calculates the interest by multiplying the current balance by the rate divided by 100.\n\n5. If the interest rate is set to 0, the calculation inside the method would be:\n   `self.balance += self.balance * (0 / 100)`\n\n6. Any number multiplied by 0 is 0, so the balance will not change.\n\n7.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `add_monthly_interest` method calculates the interest based on the current balance and the given interest rate.\n\n2.

This means that when the interest rate is 0, no additional amount is added to the balance.\n\n5.
