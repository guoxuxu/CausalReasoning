  "Explanation": "Changing a student's 'active' status to False effectively removes the student's score from the average calculation because the average_score function only considers 'active' students. Thus, if initially, the active students had higher scores on average, removing one would decrease the overall average.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with two active students in the `students` list.\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=85, active=True\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n2. **Average Calculation**:\n   - The initial average score is calculated as (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5.\n\n3. **Update Score**:\n   - We update student 1's score to 95.\n   - Now the scores are: 95 (student 1) and 90 (student 2).\n   - The new average is (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5.\n\n4. **Deactivate Student**:\n   - We deactivate student 1 by setting their 'active' status to False.\n   - The scores list now only includes student 2's score: 90.\n   - The new average is 90.\n\n5. **Key Insight**:\n   - When a student's 'active' status is changed from True to False, they are removed from the scores list used to calculate the average.\n   - This directly affects the sum of scores and the number of active students, potentially changing the average score.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Yes, the average score can indeed decrease if a student's 'active' status is changed from True to False without modifying the scores.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `average_score` function calculates the average of all active student scores.\n2. When a student's 'active' status is set to False, they are no longer included in the calculation of the average score.\n3. In the provided code:\n   - Initially, there are two active students with scores 85 and 90.\n   - The average score is calculated as (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5.\n   - The student with id 1 has their score updated to 95 but remains active.\n   - The new average is (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5.\n   - Student with id 1 is then deactivated.\n4. When student 1 is deactivated, only one active student remains with a score of 90.\n5. The new average score is 90.\n\nThe key point here is that deactivating a student excludes their score from the average calculation. If the deactivated student had a lower score than the average, the average would indeed decrease. However, since the student was already active and their score was higher than the initial average (87.5), deactivating them does not necessarily change the average.\n\nTo confirm, let's check the average before and after deactivation:\n\n- Before deactivation (after updating score to 95): 92.5\n- After deactivation: 90\n\nThe average did decrease from 92.5 to 90 when student 1 was deactivated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with two active students.\n   - Student 1: id=1, score=85, active=True\n   - Student 2: id=2, score=90, active=True\n\n2. **Average Calculation**:\n   - The initial average score is calculated as (85 + 90) / 2 = 87.5.\n\n3. **Updating Score**:\n   - We update Student 1's score to 95.\n   - Now, the scores are 95 and 90.\n   - The new average is (95 + 90) / 2 = 92.5.\n\n4. **Deactivating Student**:\n   - We deactivate Student 1 by setting their 'active' status to False.\n   - Only Student 2 remains active with a score of 90.\n\n5. **Final Average Calculation**:\n   - Since only one student is now active, the average score is simply the remaining student's score, which is 90.\n\n6. **Comparison**:\n   - Initial average: 87.5\n   - Final average after deactivating Student 1: 90\n\nThe average score does not decrease; it increases from 87.5 to 90 when Student 1's 'active' status is changed from True to False without modifying the scores.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the `average_score` function**:\n   - It filters out inactive students (where `item['active']` is `False`).\n   - It calculates the average of the remaining active students' scores.\n\n2. **Initial State**:\n   - Students list: `[{'id': 1, 'score': 85, 'active': True}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}]`\n   - Average score: \\( \\frac{85 + 90}{2} = 87.5 \\)\n\n3. **After updating student 1's score to 95**:\n   - Students list: `[{'id': 1, 'score': 95, 'active': True}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}]`\n   - Average score: \\( \\frac{95 + 90}{2} = 92.5 \\)\n\n4. **After deactivating student 1**:\n   - Students list: `[{'id': 1, 'score': 95, 'active': False}, {'id': 2, 'score': 90, 'active': True}]`\n   - Average score: \\( \\frac{90}{1} = 90 \\)\n\n5. **Key Observation**:\n   - The change in average score when deactivating a student (changing `active` to `False`) depends on whether the student was contributing positively, negatively, or neutrally to the average.\n   - In our case, student 1 had a higher score (95) than the current average (90), so deactivating them decreases the average.\n\n6. **General Case**:\n   - If a student with an active `True` has a score that is higher than the current average, deactivating them will decrease the average.\n   - If their score is lower, it might increase the average.\n   - If their score is equal to the average, it won't change the average.\n\nSince we can deduce that changing the `active` status from `True` to `False` for a student who is contributing positively to the average (i.e., having a higher score) will indeed decrease the average score, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
