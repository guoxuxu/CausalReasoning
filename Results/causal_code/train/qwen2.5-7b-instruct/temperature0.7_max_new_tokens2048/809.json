    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `startEngine()` method checks two conditions:\n   - `this.gasTank > 0`\n   - `this.engineHealth > 50`\n\n2. For the car to start running, both of these conditions must be true.\n\n3. Adding gas to the car's tank will only affect the first condition (`this.gasTank > 0`).\n\n4. Even if we add a significant amount of gas to the tank, the engine health (`this.engineHealth`) could still be less than or equal to 50, which would prevent the car from starting.\n\n5.
