    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function Behavior**:\n   - The original `process_data` function doubles the input data and then adds 10.\n   - For an input of 5, the calculation is: \\( (5 \\times 2) + 10 = 20 \\).\n\n2. **Modified Function Behavior**:\n   - If the function were modified to triple the input data instead of doubling it, the new calculation would be: \\( (5 \\times 3) + 10 = 25 \\).\n   - The increase in 'result' from 20 to 25 is indeed observed.\n\n3. **Determining the Cause**:\n   - To conclusively determine if the change was due to modifying the function from doubling to tripling, we need to consider other possible factors that could cause such an increase.\n   - However, based solely on the information provided and assuming no other changes were made, the observed increase directly correlates with the modification of the function.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the direct correlation between the modification of the function and the observed increase, we can reasonably infer that the change was due to the modification described.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
