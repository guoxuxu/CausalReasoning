    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `addItem` method is defined in the `ShopCart` class.\n2. This method takes a single parameter `price`, which is a double value.\n3.

The question specifically asks if calling `addItem` with a specific price will increase `totalCost`.\n\n5. When `addItem` is called with any positive price (i.e., a non-zero value):\n   - `totalCost` is directly modified by adding the provided price to it.\n\n6.
