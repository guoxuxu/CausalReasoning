    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - `data` is an instance of `SalesData` with a base price of 100 and a discount of 10%.\n   - The initial final price is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_price} = 100 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 100 \\times 0.90 = 90\n     \\]\n\n2. **Applying the Coupon**:\n   - The `apply_coupon` method is called with a value of 5.\n   - This increases the existing discount by 5%, making the new discount 15%.\n   - The final price is recalculated using the new discount:\n     \\[\n     \\text{new\\_final\\_price} = 100 \\times (1 - 0.15) = 100 \\times 0.85 = 85\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - The initial final price was 90.\n   - The new final price after applying the coupon is 85.\n\nSince 85 is less than 90, the final price does indeed decrease when the coupon is applied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with an instance of `SalesData` where the base price is 100 and the initial discount is 10%. This means the initial final price is calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{final\\_price} = 100 \\times (1 - 10/100) = 100 \\times 0.9 = 90\n   \\]\n\n2. **Applying Coupon**: The `apply_coupon` method is called with a value of 5. This increases the discount by 5%, so the new discount becomes 15%.\n   \n3. **New Final Price Calculation**: With the new discount of 15%, the final price is recalculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{final\\_price} = 100 \\times (1 - 15/100) = 100 \\times 0.85 = 85\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparison**: The original final price was 90, and after applying the coupon, the final price is 85.\n\nSince the final price decreases from 90 to 85 when the coupon is applied, the answer to the question \"If a coupon is applied, will this decrease the final_price?\" is Yes.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
