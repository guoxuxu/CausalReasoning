  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The isItCold() method is designed to return true only when the temperature is below 20 degrees. Thus, if this method returns true, it is a direct result and can be inferred that the temperature is indeed below this threshold.",
  "causal_map": "isItCold() → temperature < 20",
