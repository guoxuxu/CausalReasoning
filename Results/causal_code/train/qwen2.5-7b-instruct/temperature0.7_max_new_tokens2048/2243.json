    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Class Definition**: We have a `WeatherForecast` class with two boolean attributes: `cloudy` and `rain`.\n\n2. **Constructor Logic**:\n   - If `cloudy` is true, the probability of rain is determined by `Math.random() > 0.7`, which means there's a 30% chance of rain.\n   - If `cloudy` is false, the probability of rain is determined by `Math.random() > 0.9`, which means there's only a 10% chance of rain.\n\n3. **Question Analysis**:\n   - The question asks if it is observed that it is not cloudy (i.e., `cloudy` is false), is it less likely to rain?\n\n4. **Probability Comparison**:\n   - When `cloudy` is false, the probability of rain is 10% (0.1).\n   - When `cloudy` is true, the probability of rain is 30% (0.3).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 10% (no cloudiness) is less than 30% (cloudiness), it is indeed less likely to rain when it is not cloudy compared to when it is cloudy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's analyze the given code step by step:\n\n1. The `WeatherForecast` class has two private boolean fields: `cloudy` and `rain`.\n\n2. The constructor takes one parameter, `cloudy`, which initializes the `cloudy` field.\n\n3. If `cloudy` is true:\n   - `this.rain` is set to `Math.random() > 0.7`. This means there is a 30% chance of rain (since 1 - 0.7 = 0.3).\n\n4. If `cloudy` is false:\n   - `this.rain` is set to `Math.random() > 0.9`. This means there is a 10% chance of rain (since 1 - 0.9 = 0.1).\n\n5. The method `willItRain()` returns the value of `this.rain`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where it is observed that it is not cloudy (`cloudy` is false). According to the logic in the constructor, when `cloudy` is false, the probability of rain is 10%.\n\nWhen it is cloudy (`cloudy` is true), the probability of rain is 30%.\n\nSince 10% (when not cloudy) is less than 30% (when cloudy), it is indeed less likely to rain if it is observed that it is not cloudy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
