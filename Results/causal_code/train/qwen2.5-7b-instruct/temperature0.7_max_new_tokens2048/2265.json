    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` takes three parameters: `base_score`, `bonus_points`, and `has_bonus`.\n2. The logic inside the function checks if `has_bonus` is True.\n3. If `has_bonus` is True, it adds `bonus_points` to `base_score` to get `final_score`.\n4. If `has_bonus` is False, it simply returns `base_score` without any modifications from `bonus_points`.\n\nNow, considering the question:\n- We are asked if setting 'has_bonus' to False will prevent changes in 'bonus_points' from affecting 'final_score'.\n\nGiven the code logic:\n- When `has_bonus` is False, the function directly returns `base_score` without considering `bonus_points`.\n- Therefore, if `has_bonus` is set to False, any changes to `bonus_points` will not influence the value of `final_score`.\n\nSo, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
