    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the formula when `use_extra_feature` is False**:\n   - The `new_metric` is calculated as: `data['sales'] * 0.1`\n   - This means the `new_metric` is directly proportional to `sales`.\n\n2. **Analyze the relationship between `new_metric` and `sales`**:\n   - Since the formula for `new_metric` only includes `sales` (and no other variables) when `use_extra_feature` is False, any increase in `sales` will directly result in an increase in `new_metric`.\n   - There are no other factors that could potentially offset or negate the effect of an increase in `sales`.\n\n3. **Consider potential edge cases**:\n   - The formula does not include any negative terms or conditions that would cause the `new_metric` to decrease even if `sales` increases.\n   - The constant 0.1 ensures that the `new_metric` will always increase proportionally with `sales` unless `sales` is zero.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the given formula, an increase in `sales` will always lead to an increase in `new_metric` when the `use_extra_feature` is False.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that an increase in `new_metric` necessarily means an increase in `sales` if the extra feature is not used is correct.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the function**:\n   - The function `compute_metrics` calculates a new metric based on the input data.\n   - If `use_extra_feature` is `False`, the new metric is calculated as `data['sales'] * 0.1`.\n\n2. **New Metric Calculation**:\n   - When `use_extra_feature` is `False`, the new metric is solely dependent on `data['sales']`.\n   - The formula for the new metric is `data['sales'] * 0.1`. This means that the new metric is directly proportional to the value of `data['sales']`.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Relationship**:\n   - Since the new metric is directly proportional to `data['sales']` (i.e., `new_metric = 0.1 * sales`), any increase in `data['sales']` will result in a corresponding increase in the new metric.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the relationship between `sales` and `new_metric` is linear and positive when `use_extra_feature` is `False`, an increase in `sales` will necessarily lead to an increase in the `new_metric`.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that an increase in `new_metric` necessarily means an increase in `sales` if the extra feature is not used is correct.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The function then returns the sum of `new_metric`.\n\nNow, let's consider whether an increase in `new_metric` necessarily means an increase in `sales` when the extra feature is not used.\n\n4. The formula for `new_metric` does not include any direct dependency on `returns`. It only depends on `sales`.\n5. Since `new_metric` is directly proportional to `sales` (with a coefficient of 0.1), an increase in `sales` will result in a corresponding increase in `new_metric`.\n6. Conversely, a decrease in `sales` would result in a decrease in `new_metric`.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that an increase in `new_metric` will indeed correspond to an increase in `sales` when the extra feature is not used.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

This formula shows that the new metric is directly proportional to sales. \n\n4. If sales increase, the term `data['sales'] * 0.1` will also increase because the coefficient (0.1) is positive.\n\n5. Conversely, if sales decrease, the term `data['sales'] * 0.1` will decrease.\n\n6. There are no other factors in the formula that could offset or reduce the effect of sales on the new metric when `use_extra_feature` is False.\n\n7.
