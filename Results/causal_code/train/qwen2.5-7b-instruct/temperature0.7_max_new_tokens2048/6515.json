    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a method `simulateRain` in the `WeatherSimulator` class.\n2. This method takes two boolean parameters: `humidityHigh` and `cloudsFormed`.\n3. The method checks if both `humidityHigh` and `cloudsFormed` are true.\n4.

In the `main` method, we call `simulateRain(true, true)`.\n7. This means both `humidityHigh` and `cloudsFormed` are passed as `true`.\n8.
