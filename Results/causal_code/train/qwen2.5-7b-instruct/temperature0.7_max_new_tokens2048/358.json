    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The temperature is calculated based on whether it's cloudy or not.\n2.

We're asked if the observed temperature being below 20 definitely indicates it was cloudy.\n5. From the above calculation, we can see that even when it's not cloudy, the lowest possible temperature is 20.\n6. Therefore, if the temperature is below 20, it must have been cloudy because it's not possible to get a temperature below 20 when it's not cloudy.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. The `WeatherSimulation` class has two key properties:\n   - `isCloudy`: A boolean indicating whether the weather is cloudy.\n   - `temperature`: An integer representing the current temperature.\n\n2. The constructor sets these values based on random conditions:\n   - `isCloudy` is true if `Math.random()` is greater than 0.5, otherwise false.\n   - If `isCloudy` is true, the temperature is set to a value between 10 and 19 inclusive.\n   - If `isCloudy` is false, the temperature is set to a value between 20 and 34 inclusive.\n\n3. The question asks if the observed temperature is below 20, was it definitely cloudy?\n\n4. From the constructor logic:\n   - Temperatures below 20 can only be achieved when `isCloudy` is true.\n   - When `isCloudy` is false, the minimum possible temperature is 20.\n\n5. Therefore, if the observed temperature is below 20, it must have been cloudy because the temperature can only drop below 20 if `isCloudy` is true.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that if the observed temperature is below 20, it was definitely cloudy.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial state of the weather simulation is determined by a random process:\n   - `isCloudy` is true with 50% probability.\n   - If `isCloudy` is true, the temperature is between 10 and 19.\n   - If `isCloudy` is false, the temperature is between 20 and 34.\n\n2. We need to determine if the temperature being below 20 definitely means it was cloudy.\n\n3. Let's look at the temperature ranges:\n   - When `isCloudy` is true, the temperature can be 10, 11, ..., 19.\n   - When `isCloudy` is false, the temperature can be 20, 21, ..., 34.\n\n4. The only temperatures below 20 that can occur are from when `isCloudy` is true (10 to 19).\n\n5. However, just because the temperature is below 20, it doesn't necessarily mean it was definitely cloudy. It could have been cloudy and the temperature could have been 10, 11, ..., 19. But it also could have been not cloudy and the temperature could have been 20, which is technically not below 20 but is the lowest possible temperature when not cloudy.\n\n6. Therefore, while the temperature being below 20 strongly suggests that it was cloudy, it is not a definitive indicator that it was definitely cloudy.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot conclude that the temperature being below 20 definitely means it was cloudy.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
