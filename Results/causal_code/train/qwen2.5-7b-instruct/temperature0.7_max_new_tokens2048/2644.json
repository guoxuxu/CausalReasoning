    "Let's break down the function `compute_score` step by step to determine if upgrading the system will always increase the score.\n\n1. **Bonus Calculation**:\n   - If `age > 2`, then `bonus = 10`.\n   - Otherwise, `bonus = 5`.\n\n2. **System Upgrade Effect**:\n   - If `system_upgrade` is `True`, the bonus increases by an additional 5.\n   - So, if `age > 2`, the bonus becomes 15.\n   - If `age <= 2`, the bonus becomes 10.\n\n3. **Score Calculation**:\n   - The score is calculated as `100 - error_count + bonus`.\n\nNow, let's analyze whether upgrading the system (setting `system_upgrade` to `True`) will always increase the score:\n\n- **Without System Upgrade**:\n  - If `age > 2`, the initial bonus is 10.\n  - If `age <= 2`, the initial bonus is 5.\n  - The score without upgrade is `100 - error_count + bonus`.\n\n- **With System Upgrade**:\n  - If `age > 2`, the bonus becomes 15.\n  - If `age <= 2`, the bonus becomes 10.\n  - The score with upgrade is `100 - error_count + (bonus + 5)`.\n\nTo determine if the upgrade always increases the score, we need to compare the two scenarios:\n\n- **Case 1: `age > 2`**\n  - Without upgrade: `100 - error_count + 10`\n  - With upgrade: `100 - error_count + 15`\n  - The score increases by 5, which is positive.\n\n- **Case 2: `age <= 2`**\n  - Without upgrade: `100 - error_count + 5`\n  - With upgrade: `100 - error_count + 10`\n  - The score increases by 5, which is positive.\n\nIn both cases, upgrading the system results in an increase of the score by 5 points, assuming `error_count` remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Bonus Calculation**:\n   - If `age > 2`, the bonus is set to 10.\n   - Otherwise, the bonus is set to 5.\n   - Upgrading the system (`system_upgrade = True`) adds an additional 5 to the bonus.\n\n2. **Score Calculation**:\n   - The score is calculated as `100 - error_count + bonus`.\n\n3. **Effect of System Upgrade on Score**:\n   - The core of the question is whether the system upgrade (adding 5 to the bonus) will always increase the score.\n   - We need to consider the different scenarios for the `age` variable and how it affects the initial bonus value.\n\n4. **Scenarios**:\n   - **Scenario 1**: `age > 2`\n     - Initial bonus: 10\n     - After system upgrade: 10 + 5 = 15\n     - Score: `100 - error_count + 15`\n   - **Scenario 2**: `age <= 2`\n     - Initial bonus: 5\n     - After system upgrade: 5 + 5 = 10\n     - Score: `100 - error_count + 10`\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - In both scenarios, the score increases by at least 5 due to the system upgrade.\n   - Even in the worst-case scenario where `age <= 2` and `error_count` is very high (e.g., 100), the score would still be `100 - 100 + 10 = 10`, which is higher than the score without the upgrade (`100 - 100 + 5 = 5`).\n\nTherefore, based on the given logic, the system upgrade will always increase the score.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The score is calculated as: \n   `score = 100 - error_count + bonus`\n\n2. The bonus depends on the age and whether the system is upgraded:\n   - If age > 2, bonus starts at 10.\n   - If system_upgrade is True, bonus increases by 5.\n\n3. Let's consider the base scenario without any upgrade (system_upgrade = False):\n   - For age > 2, bonus = 10\n   - For age <= 2, bonus = 5\n\n4. Now, let's see what happens when we upgrade the system (system_upgrade = True):\n   - For age > 2, bonus becomes 10 + 5 = 15\n   - For age <= 2, bonus becomes 5 + 5 = 10\n\n5. Comparing the scenarios:\n   - If age > 2, the score with upgrade (100 - error_count + 15) is always higher than without upgrade (100 - error_count + 10).\n   - If age <= 2, the score with upgrade (100 - error_count + 10) is not necessarily higher than without upgrade (100 - error_count + 5). It depends on the value of error_count.\n\n6. Specifically, if error_count is 5 or more, the score without upgrade would be higher:\n   - Without upgrade: 100 - 5 + 5 = 100\n   - With upgrade: 100 - 5 + 10 = 105\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that while upgrading the system generally increases the score, it does not always do so, depending on the age and the number of errors.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Bonus Calculation**:\n   - If `age > 2`, then `bonus` is set to 10.\n   - Otherwise, `bonus` is set to 5.\n\n2. **System Upgrade Effect**:\n   - If `system_upgrade` is `True`, the `bonus` is increased by 5.\n\n3. **Score Calculation**:\n   - The score is calculated as `100 - error_count + bonus`.\n\nNow let's consider the impact of `system_upgrade` on the score:\n\n- **Scenario 1: `age <= 2`**\n  - `bonus` is 5.\n  - If `system_upgrade` is `True`, `bonus` becomes 10.\n  - The difference in score due to `system_upgrade` is an additional 5 points (from 5 to 10).\n\n- **Scenario 2: `age > 2`**\n  - `bonus` is 10.\n  - If `system_upgrade` is `True`, `bonus` becomes 15.\n  - The difference in score due to `system_upgrade` is an additional 5 points (from 10 to 15).\n\nIn both scenarios, upgrading the system increases the `bonus` by 5 points. Since the score is calculated as `100 - error_count + bonus`, and `error_count` is subtracted from 100, increasing `bonus` will always result in a higher score.\n\nTherefore, the action of upgrading the system will always increase the score.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `compute_score` function takes three parameters: `age`, `system_upgrade`, and `error_count`.\n\n2. The `bonus` variable is set based on the `age` parameter:\n   - If `age > 2`, then `bonus = 10`\n   - Otherwise, `bonus = 5`\n\n3. If `system_upgrade` is `True`, an additional 5 points are added to the `bonus`.\n\n4. The `score` is calculated as:\n   `score = 100 - error_count + bonus`\n\nNow, let's consider whether upgrading the system (setting `system_upgrade` to `True`) will always increase the score.\n\n- The base score without any upgrades (`system_upgrade = False`) would be `100 - error_count + bonus`.\n- With the system upgraded (`system_upgrade = True`), the score becomes `100 - error_count + bonus + 5`.\n\nTo determine if the upgrade always increases the score, we need to compare these two scores:\n\n1. Base score: \\( 100 - \\text{error\\_count} + \\text{bonus} \\)\n2. Upgraded score: \\( 100 - \\text{error\\_count} + \\text{bonus} + 5 \\)\n\nSince adding 5 to the base score will always result in a higher score, regardless of the values of `age`, `error_count`, and the initial value of `bonus`, the upgrade will always increase the score.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
