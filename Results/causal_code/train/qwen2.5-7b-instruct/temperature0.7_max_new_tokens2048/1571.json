  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The updateWeather function sets the weatherType to its argument. Setting it to 'rainy' causes shouldTakeUmbrella to check this new state, returning true because it directly checks if weatherType is 'rainy'.",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We start with an instance of `WeatherTracker` where `weatherType` is initialized to 'sunny'.\n\n2.

The `shouldTakeUmbrella()` method checks if `weatherType` is equal to 'rainy'.\n\n4.
