    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function Behavior**:\n   - If `is_member` is True, the discount is 10%.\n   - If `is_member` is False, the discount is 2%.\n\n2. **New Discount Policy**:\n   - The new policy sets a flat 5% discount for all shoppers.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - For a member customer with a 10% discount, the final price would be `price * (1 - 0.10) = price * 0.90`.\n   - For a non-member customer with a 2% discount, the final price would be `price * (1 - 0.02) = price * 0.98`.\n   - With the new flat 5% discount, the final price for both members and non-members becomes `price * (1 - 0.05) = price * 0.95`.\n\n4. **Final Price Comparison**:\n   - Original member price: `0.90 * price`\n   - Original non-member price: `0.98 * price`\n   - New price for both: `0.95 * price`\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Under the new flat 5% discount, the final price for both members and non-members will be lower than their original prices.\n   - Therefore, if the final price for an item remains higher for some customers after changing the discount to a flat 5%, it cannot be due to their membership status since the new discount applies equally to all customers.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the logic of the function `compute_discount`:\n\n1. If `is_member` is `True`, the discount applied is 10%.\n2. If `is_member` is `False`, the discount applied is 2%.\n\nNow, let's consider the change to a flat 5% discount for all shoppers:\n\n- With the original logic, members get a 10% discount, and non-members get a 2% discount.\n- With the new flat 5% discount, both members and non-members will have the same final price after applying the discount.\n\nGiven this, if the final price for an item remains higher for some customers after changing the discount to a flat 5%, it must be because those customers had a higher base price before the discount was applied, or they were members who previously received a larger discount (10%) compared to the new flat rate (5%).\n\nHowever, based solely on the change in discount percentage without any change in the base prices, the only way the final price could remain higher for some customers is if those customers were previously benefiting from the 10% discount as members, and now, with the flat 5% discount, they are not seeing the same reduction in price.\n\nTherefore, the reason the final price for an item remains higher for some customers is indeed related to their membership status.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
