  "Explanation": "In the code, the temperature is adjusted to 30 or higher when it is sunny. Thus, setting it to 35 in sunny conditions keeps it at 35. As both sunny conditions and temperature above 25 are met, the method 'willPeopleGoOutside' returns true.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the conditions for people going outside:**\n   - The `willPeopleGoOutside()` method checks two conditions:\n     - It must be sunny (`isSunny`).\n     - The temperature must be greater than 25 degrees (`temperature > 25`).\n\n2. **Determine the state of the weather controller:**\n   - We are setting the temperature to 35 degrees during sunny weather.\n   - This means:\n     - `isSunny` is true.\n     - `temperature` is set to 35.\n\n3. **Check the conditions for people going outside:**\n   - Since `isSunny` is true, the first condition is satisfied.\n   - The temperature (35 degrees) is greater than 25 degrees, so the second condition is also satisfied.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both conditions for people going outside are met.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `setWeather` method is called with `sunny` set to true and `temp` set to 35.\n2. Since `sunny` is true, the condition inside the if block is checked:\n   - `temperature = temp >= 30 ? temp : 30;`\n   - Here, `temp` is 35, which is greater than or equal to 30.\n   - Therefore, `temperature` is set to 35.\n3. The `isSunny` variable is set to true based on the input parameter.\n4. Now we need to check the `willPeopleGoOutside()` method:\n   - It returns `true` if both `isSunny` is true and `temperature` is greater than 25.\n   - From our previous steps, we know `isSunny` is true and `temperature` is 35.\n   - 35 is indeed greater than 25.\n\nTherefore, people will go outside.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
