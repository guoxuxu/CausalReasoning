    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with the initial state of the `WeatherSimulator` class:\n   - `temperature = 20`\n   - `isRaining = false`\n\n2. The `setTemperature` method is called with `newTemp = 2`.\n\n3. Inside `setTemperature`, the first action is to set `temperature` to `newTemp`, which means:\n   - `temperature = 2`\n\n4. Then, the method checks if `temperature < 5`. \n   - Since 2 is indeed less than 5, the condition is true.\n\n5. As a result of the condition being true, `isRaining` is set to `true`.\n\nTherefore, when we call `setTemperature(2)`, `isRaining` will be set to `true` because the temperature is below 5.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `setTemperature` method sets the temperature to the provided value.\n2. If the new temperature is less than 5, the method sets `isRaining` to true.\n\nGiven:\n- We call `setTemperature(2)`.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The initial temperature is 20.\n2. We set the temperature to 2 using `setTemperature(2)`.\n3. Since 2 is less than 5, the condition `if (temperature < 5)` evaluates to true.\n4. As a result, `isRaining` is set to true.\n\nTherefore, when we set the temperature to 2 using the `setTemperature` method, it will indeed start raining because the condition for rain (temperature < 5) is met.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `setTemperature` method takes an integer argument and sets the `temperature` instance variable to that value.\n2.

Inside `setTemperature`, the following actions occur:\n   - The `temperature` is updated to 2.\n   - There is an `if` condition that checks if `temperature < 5`.\n   - Since 2 is indeed less than 5, the condition evaluates to true.\n   - As a result, `isRaining` is set to true.\n\n4. No other conditions or methods are called after setting the temperature to 2.\n\nGiven this sequence of events, when we set the temperature to 2 using the `setTemperature` method, the `isRaining` variable is explicitly set to true based on the condition inside the method.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
