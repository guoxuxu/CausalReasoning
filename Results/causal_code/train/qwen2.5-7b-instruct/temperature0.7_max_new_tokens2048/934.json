    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial temperature is set to 20.0 degrees Celsius.\n2. The `increaseTemperature` method is called with an argument of 15 degrees (to get the total to 35 degrees).\n3. Inside the `increaseTemperature` method:\n   - The current temperature (20.0) is increased by the passed value (15), resulting in a new temperature of 35.0 degrees.\n   - There is a check to see if the new temperature exceeds 30 degrees.\n4. Since 35.0 is greater than 30, the condition `if (this.temperature > 30)` evaluates to true.\n5. As a result of this condition being true, `this.isRaining` is set to true.\n\nTherefore, if the temperature is artificially increased to 35 degrees, it will indeed start raining according to the rules defined in the `WeatherSimulator` class.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial temperature in the `WeatherSimulator` class is set to 20.0 degrees Celsius.\n2. We need to artificially increase the temperature to 35 degrees.\n3. The method `increaseTemperature(double degrees)` is used to increase the temperature.\n4. This method takes a parameter `degrees` which we will set to 15 (since 20 + 15 = 35).\n5. Inside the `increaseTemperature` method, the new temperature is calculated as `this.temperature += degrees`.\n6. After increasing the temperature to 35, the condition `if (this.temperature > 30)` is checked.\n7. Since 35 is indeed greater than 30, the condition evaluates to true.\n8.
