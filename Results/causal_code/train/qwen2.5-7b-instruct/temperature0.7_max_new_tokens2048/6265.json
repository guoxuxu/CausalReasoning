    "Let's break down the logic of the `allocateMarketingBudget` method:\n\n1. The method takes an `additionalBudget` parameter.\n2. It adds this `additionalBudget` to the current `marketingBudget`.\n3. If the new `marketingBudget` exceeds 1000, it increases `unitsSold` by 50.\n4. Otherwise, it increases `unitsSold` by 20.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific case where the `additionalBudget` is 2000:\n\n- The initial `marketingBudget` value does not affect the outcome since we are only concerned with the change due to the additional budget.\n- With an additional budget of 2000, the new `marketingBudget` will be significantly higher than 1000.\n- Therefore, the condition `if (marketingBudget > 1000)` will evaluate to true.\n- As a result, `unitsSold` will be increased by 50.\n\nSo, increasing the marketing budget by 2000 will indeed lead to an increase in sales units by 50.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `ProductSales` class has an `allocateMarketingBudget` method that takes an `additionalBudget` parameter.\n2. This method increases the current `marketingBudget` by the `additionalBudget`.\n3. It then checks if the new `marketingBudget` exceeds 1000:\n   - If it does, it increases `unitsSold` by 50.\n   - If it doesn't, it increases `unitsSold` by 20.\n\n4. The key point here is that the increase in `unitsSold` is based on whether the new `marketingBudget` exceeds 1000, not directly on the amount of the `additionalBudget`.\n\n5. In this case, we're increasing the `marketingBudget` by 2000.\n\n6. Since 2000 is greater than 1000, the condition `if (marketingBudget > 1000)` will be true.\n\n7. Therefore, the `unitsSold` will be increased by 50, regardless of the exact amount of the increase (2000 in this case).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `allocateMarketingBudget` method takes an `additionalBudget` parameter.\n2. If the new marketing budget (`marketingBudget + additionalBudget`) exceeds 1000:\n   - The units sold (`unitsSold`) will increase by 50.\n3. If the new marketing budget does not exceed 1000:\n   - The units sold will increase by 20.\n\nGiven that the marketing budget is increased by 2000, we need to check if this directly increases the sales units:\n\n- Initial marketing budget is stored in `marketingBudget`.\n- Adding 2000 to `marketingBudget` results in a new value of `marketingBudget + 2000`.\n- Since 2000 is a significant amount, it is very likely that `marketingBudget + 2000` will exceed 1000.\n\nTherefore, with an increase of 2000 to the marketing budget, the units sold will definitely increase by 50 (as per the code logic).\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ProductSales` class has a method `allocateMarketingBudget(int additionalBudget)` which takes an additional budget as input.\n2. This method adds the additional budget to the current marketing budget.\n3. If the new marketing budget exceeds 1000, it increases the units sold by 50.\n4. Otherwise, it increases the units sold by 20.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the marketing budget is increased by 2000:\n\n- Initially, we don't know the value of the marketing budget, but it doesn't matter for our analysis since we're only concerned with whether it exceeds 1000 after adding 2000.\n- When 2000 is added to the marketing budget, the new marketing budget will be at least 2000 (assuming the original marketing budget was non-negative).\n- Since 2000 is greater than 1000, the condition `if (marketingBudget > 1000)` will be true.\n- Therefore, the units sold will increase by 50.\n\nSo, increasing the marketing budget by 2000 will indeed directly increase the sales units by 50.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ProductSales` class has a method `allocateMarketingBudget(int additionalBudget)` which increases the marketing budget and adjusts the number of units sold based on the new budget.\n\n2. If the marketing budget is increased by 2000, we need to check the conditions in the `allocateMarketingBudget` method:\n   - If the new budget (`marketingBudget + additionalBudget`) is greater than 1000, then `unitsSold` is increased by 50.\n   - Otherwise, `unitsSold` is increased by 20.\n\n3. Since the initial marketing budget is not specified, let's consider two scenarios:\n   - Scenario A: If the initial marketing budget is less than or equal to 800 (1000 - 2000), increasing it by 2000 would make it more than 1000, leading to an increase of 50 units.\n   - Scenario B: If the initial marketing budget is greater than 800 but less than 1000, increasing it by 2000 would still make it more than 1000, again leading to an increase of 50 units.\n\n4. In both scenarios, the increase in the marketing budget by 2000 results in an increase in units sold by 50, as the condition `if (marketingBudget > 1000)` will be met.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
