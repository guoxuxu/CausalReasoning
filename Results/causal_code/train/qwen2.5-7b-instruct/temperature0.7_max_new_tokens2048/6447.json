    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `activate` method is called.\n2. Inside `activate`, the line `active = true;` sets the `active` flag to `true`.\n3. Then, `alertStatus()` is called.\n4. In `alertStatus`, the condition checks if `active` is `true`.\n5. Since `active` was set to `true` in the `activate` method, the condition `if (active)` evaluates to `true`.\n6. As a result, the block inside the `if` statement executes, calling `sendAlert('System is active.');`\n7. `sendAlert` prints the message \"System is active.\"\n\nTherefore, when the `activate` method is called, \"System is active.\" will indeed be printed.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
