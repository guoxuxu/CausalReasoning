  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "When `cost_increase` is 0 and `demand_rising` changes from False to True, `production_units` shifts from `50 + 0//2` to `100 + 0`. This change increases `production_units` from 50 to 100, reflecting a direct implication of increasing `demand_rising` with controlled `cost_increase`.",
  "causal_map": "demand_rising → production_units; cost_increase → production_units",
  "causal_map_integration": "When demand_rising is True, production_units is determined by 100 + cost_increase. When demand_rising is False, production_units is determined by 50 + cost_increase // 2. Therefore, increasing demand_rising from False to True while holding cost_increase at 0 will increase production_units from 50 to 100.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: `cost_increase` is set to 0.\n2. **Initial State**:\n   - `demand_rising` is False.\n   - The production calculation is as follows:\n     - If `demand_rising` is False, then `production_units = 50 + cost_increase // 2`.\n     - Since `cost_increase` is 0, `cost_increase // 2` is also 0.\n     - Therefore, `production_units = 50 + 0 = 50`.\n\n3. **Change in Condition**:\n   - Now, `demand_rising` is changed to True.\n   - The production calculation changes to:\n     - If `demand_rising` is True, then `production_units = 100 + cost_increase`.\n     - Since `cost_increase` is still 0, `production_units = 100 + 0 = 100`.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Initially, with `demand_rising` as False, `production_units` was 50.\n   - After changing `demand_rising` to True, `production_units` becomes 100.\n\nSince 100 is greater than 50, increasing `demand_rising` from False to True does indeed increase `production_units`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's break down the function and analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. The function `increase_production` takes two parameters:\n   - `cost_increase`: an integer value.\n   - `demand_rising`: a boolean value.\n\n2. We need to evaluate the function when `cost_increase` is 0 and `demand_rising` changes from False to True.\n\n3. When `demand_rising` is False:\n   - The production units calculation is `50 + cost_increase // 2`.\n   - With `cost_increase` being 0, this becomes `50 + 0 // 2`, which simplifies to `50`.\n\n4. When `demand_rising` is True:\n   - The production units calculation is `100 + cost_increase`.\n   - With `cost_increase` being 0, this becomes `100 + 0`, which simplifies to `100`.\n\n5. Comparing the two scenarios:\n   - If `demand_rising` is False, the production units are 50.\n   - If `demand_rising` is True, the production units are 100.\n\n6. Since 100 (when `demand_rising` is True) is greater than 50 (when `demand_rising` is False), increasing `demand_rising` from False to True does indeed increase the `production_units`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
