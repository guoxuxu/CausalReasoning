    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficLightController` class is initialized with the red light on (`True`), yellow and green lights off (`False`).\n\n2. The first call to `change_light('NEXT')` changes the state from 'RED' to 'GREEN'. During this transition:\n   - The red light is turned off (`red_light = False`).\n   - The green light is turned on (`green_light = True`).\n\n3. The second call to `change_light('NEXT')` changes the state from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW'. During this transition:\n   - The green light is turned off (`green_light = False`).\n   - The yellow light is turned on (`yellow_light = True`).\n\n4. The third call to `change_light('RESET')` changes the state back to 'RED'. During this transition:\n   - The yellow light is turned off (`yellow_light = False`).\n   - The red light is turned on (`red_light = True`).\n   - The green and yellow lights are reset (`green_light = False`, `yellow_light = False`).\n\n5. At no point during these operations is the yellow light turned on as a direct result of the 'NEXT' command being issued while in the 'GREEN' state.\n\n6. The yellow light only turns on when transitioning from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW', which happens as a result of the 'NEXT' command being issued while in the 'GREEN' state.\n\nHowever, the question asks if the yellow light being on implies that the 'NEXT' command was set while in the state 'GREEN'. Based on the sequence of events described, the yellow light turning on does indeed correspond to the 'NEXT' command being issued while in the 'GREEN' state.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial state of the traffic light controller is 'RED', with only the red light on.\n\n2. When the command 'NEXT' is given:\n   - If the current state is 'RED', it transitions to 'GREEN'.\n   - If the current state is 'GREEN', it transitions to 'YELLOW'.\n   - If the current state is 'YELLOW', it transitions back to 'RED'.\n\n3. We can see from the code execution:\n   - `controller.change_light('NEXT')` changes the state from 'RED' to 'GREEN'.\n   - `controller.change_light('NEXT')` changes the state from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW'.\n   - `controller.change_light('RESET')` changes the state back to 'RED'.\n\n4. The question asks if the yellow light being on implies that the 'NEXT' command was set while in the state 'GREEN'.\n\n5. From the sequence of commands:\n   - The first 'NEXT' sets the state from 'RED' to 'GREEN'.\n   - The second 'NEXT' sets the state from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW'.\n\n6. Therefore, the yellow light being on indicates that the state was 'YELLOW', which directly resulted from the 'NEXT' command being executed while the state was 'GREEN'.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the initial state of the traffic light controller:\n   - Red light is on (True)\n   - Yellow light is off (False)\n   - Green light is off (False)\n\n2. The first `change_light('NEXT')` call:\n   - Changes the state from 'RED' to 'GREEN'\n   - Turns off the red light\n   - Turns on the green light\n\n3. The second `change_light('NEXT')` call:\n   - Changes the state from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW'\n   - Turns off the green light\n   - Turns on the yellow light\n\n4. At this point, the yellow light is on.\n\n5. The third `change_light('RESET')` call:\n   - Resets the state back to 'RED'\n   - Turns off all lights (yellow and green)\n\nFrom this sequence, we can see that the yellow light being on implies that the traffic light went through the 'GREEN' state before reaching the 'YELLOW' state. This means that the 'NEXT' command was indeed set while in the state 'GREEN'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficLightController` class has three states: 'RED', 'GREEN', and 'YELLOW'.\n2. The `change_light` method handles two commands: 'NEXT' and 'RESET'.\n3. When the 'NEXT' command is given:\n   - If the current state is 'RED', it transitions to 'GREEN'.\n   - If the current state is 'GREEN', it transitions to 'YELLOW'.\n4. The 'RESET' command always sets the state back to 'RED'.\n5. We start with the yellow light off (`False`) and all other lights off.\n6. The first call to `change_light('NEXT')` transitions from 'RED' to 'GREEN'.\n7. The second call to `change_light('NEXT')` transitions from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW'.\n8. At this point, the yellow light should be on.\n9. If the yellow light is on, it means we must have transitioned from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW' via the 'NEXT' command.\n\nTherefore, if the yellow light is on, it does imply that the 'NEXT' command was set while in the state 'GREEN'.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial state of the traffic light controller is 'RED', with only the red light on.\n2. The first call to `change_light('NEXT')` changes the state from 'RED' to 'GREEN'.\n3. The second call to `change_light('NEXT')` changes the state from 'GREEN' to 'YELLOW'.\n4. The third call to `change_light('RESET')` resets the state back to 'RED'.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the yellow light being on implies that the 'NEXT' command was set while in the 'GREEN' state.\n\n- The yellow light can only be on if the state is 'YELLOW'.\n- The state transitions to 'YELLOW' only when the 'NEXT' command is called while in the 'GREEN' state.\n\nTherefore, if the yellow light is on, it must have been turned on by the 'NEXT' command while the state was 'GREEN'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
