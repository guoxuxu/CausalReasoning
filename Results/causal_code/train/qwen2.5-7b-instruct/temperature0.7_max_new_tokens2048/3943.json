    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The ShoppingCart class has an `items` list that stores the prices of the items added to the cart.\n2.

The `update_total` method calculates the total cost of all items in the cart by summing the values in the `items` list.\n4. There is no mechanism within the provided code to track individual items or their quantities; only their prices are stored.\n5. The `apply_discount` method adjusts the total based on a discount percentage but does not affect the item list.\n6. The `check_out` method checks if the payment covers the total cost but does not involve the item list.\n\nBased on these points, we cannot deduce which specific items were added to the cart just from knowing the total amount.
