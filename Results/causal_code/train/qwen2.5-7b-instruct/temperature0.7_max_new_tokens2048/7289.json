    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The BMI is calculated using the formula: weight / (height^2)\n2.

If a person increases their weight while keeping their height constant, the numerator of the BMI calculation will increase.\n4. Since the denominator (height squared) remains unchanged, an increase in the numerator will result in a larger overall value for the BMI.\n\nTherefore, if a person increases their weight without changing their height, their BMI will indeed increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
