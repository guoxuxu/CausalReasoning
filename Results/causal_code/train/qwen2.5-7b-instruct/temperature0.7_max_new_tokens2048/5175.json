    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The current grades for the student are 90 and 88.\n2. The average grade is calculated as (90 + 88) / 2 = 89.\n3. Since the average is currently 89, the `has_scholarship` attribute is set to True because 89 is greater than or equal to 85.\n4. If we add a grade of 95, the new list of grades will be [90, 88, 95].\n5. The new average will be (90 + 88 + 95) / 3 = 91.\n6. Since 91 is still greater than or equal to 85, the `has_scholarship` attribute should remain True.\n\nBased on this reasoning, adding a grade of 95 will not cause the student to lose the scholarship.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Student` class has an attribute `has_scholarship` which is updated based on the average grade.\n2. The `update_scholarship_status` method calculates the average of all grades and sets `has_scholarship` to True if the average is 85 or higher.\n3. Initially, the student has two grades: 90 and 88.\n4. The current average is (90 + 88) / 2 = 89.\n5. Since 89 is greater than 85, the student currently has a scholarship.\n6. If we add a grade of 95, the new average will be calculated as follows:\n   - New total sum of grades: 90 + 88 + 95 = 273\n   - New number of grades: 3\n   - New average: 273 / 3 = 91\n7. Since 91 is greater than 85, adding a grade of 95 will still result in an average that meets the requirement for maintaining the scholarship.\n\nTherefore, the student will maintain the scholarship after adding a grade of 95.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The student has already added two grades: 90 and 88.\n   - The current average grade can be calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Current Average} = \\frac{90 + 88}{2} = \\frac{178}{2} = 89\n     \\]\n\n2. **Adding a New Grade**:\n   - A new grade of 95 is added to the list of grades.\n   - The updated list of grades is now [90, 88, 95].\n\n3. **Calculating the New Average**:\n   - The new average grade is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{New Average} = \\frac{90 + 88 + 95}{3} = \\frac{273}{3} = 91\n     \\]\n\n4. **Checking Scholarship Status**:\n   - According to the `update_scholarship_status` method, the student gets a scholarship if their average grade is 85 or higher.\n   - Since the new average is 91, which is greater than 85, the student will still have the scholarship.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the student will indeed maintain the scholarship after adding a grade of 95.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
