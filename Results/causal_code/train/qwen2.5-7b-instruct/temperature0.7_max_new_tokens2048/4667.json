    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculateScore` takes two parameters:\n   - `questionsCorrect`: an integer representing the number of questions answered correctly.\n   - `bonusReceived`: a boolean indicating whether a bonus was received.\n\n2. The score is initially calculated as `10 * questionsCorrect`. This means that for each correct answer, the score increases by 10 points.\n\n3. If `bonusReceived` is true, an additional 50 points are added to the score.\n\n4. To determine if increasing `questionsCorrect` will always result in an increase in the score, we need to consider both scenarios:\n   - When `bonusReceived` is false: Increasing `questionsCorrect` will only increase the score by 10 points per correct answer.\n   - When `bonusReceived` is true: Increasing `questionsCorrect` will also increase the score by 10 points per correct answer, plus the initial 50 points from the bonus.\n\n5. In both cases, increasing `questionsCorrect` will lead to an increase in the score because the base score calculation (`10 * questionsCorrect`) directly correlates with the number of correct answers.\n\nTherefore, if 'questionsCorrect' increases, the 'score' will indeed increase without any other change.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `calculateScore` function takes two parameters:\n   - `questionsCorrect`, which is an integer representing the number of correct answers.\n   - `bonusReceived`, which is a boolean indicating whether a bonus was received.\n\n2. The function calculates the score as follows:\n   - It starts with `score = 10 * questionsCorrect`.\n   - If `bonusReceived` is `true`, it adds 50 to the score.\n\n3. In the `main` function:\n   - `correctAnswers` is set to 8.\n   - `hasBonus` is set to `true`.\n   - The function `calculateScore` is called with these values, and the result is stored in `finalScore`.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: \"If 'questionsCorrect' increases, will 'score' increase without any other change?\"\n\n- The base score is calculated as `10 * questionsCorrect`. This means that for every unit increase in `questionsCorrect`, the score increases by 10.\n- The bonus addition (`+ 50`) only happens if `bonusReceived` is `true`. Since we are not changing this value, it remains constant.\n\nTherefore, as long as `bonusReceived` stays `false`, increasing `questionsCorrect` will always lead to a proportional increase in `score`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Therefore, the bonus does not depend on the value of `questionsCorrect`.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that if `questionsCorrect` increases, the score will indeed increase by 10 points for each additional correct answer, assuming no other changes are made to the inputs.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Therefore, as long as `bonusReceived` stays `true`, increasing `questionsCorrect` will always lead to an increase in the final score.\n\n6.

It only adds a fixed value (50) to the score if it is true.\n\nSince the primary factor affecting the score based on `questionsCorrect` is directly proportional, increasing `questionsCorrect` will always lead to an increase in the score, provided that `bonusReceived` remains constant or becomes true due to an increase in `questionsCorrect`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
