    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Input Data**: The input `data` is `[5, 12, 20, 6, 3]`.\n2. **Filter Parameter**: The `filter_param` is `10`.\n3. **Cleaning Process**: The function filters out any element in `data` that is not greater than `filter_param`. So, from the input data, only `12` and `20` are greater than `10`.\n\nNow, let's consider the conditions given:\n- `len(data)` refers to the total number of elements in the original `data` list.\n- `count` in the summary refers to the number of elements in `cleaned_data`, which are those elements from `data` that are greater than `filter_param`.\n\nGiven these points, we need to determine if `count` will be equal to the length of `data` when all elements in `data` are greater than `filter_param`.\n\nIn this specific case:\n- `len(data)` is `5` (since there are 5 elements in the list `[5, 12, 20, 6, 3]`).\n- The cleaned data, after filtering, is `[12, 20]` because only these two numbers are greater than `10`.\n- Therefore, `count` in the summary is `2`.\n\nSince `count` (2) is not equal to `len(data)` (5) in this case, the answer is no.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
