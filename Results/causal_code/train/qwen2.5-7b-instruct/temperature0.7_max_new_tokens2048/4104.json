    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `process_data` takes an input dictionary `input_data`, copies it into `data`, and then modifies it based on the value of `'condition'`.\n\n2. **Modification**:\n   - It sets `'new_value'` to be twice the value of `'value'`.\n   - If `'condition'` is 'A', it sets `'result'` to be `'new_value' + 10`.\n   - If `'condition'` is not 'A' (i.e., it is 'B'), it sets `'result'` to be `'new_value' - 5`.\n\n3. **Example Input**:\n   - Given `input_example = {'value': 5, 'condition': 'A'}`, the steps are:\n     - `'new_value'` becomes `5 * 2 = 10`.\n     - Since `'condition'` is 'A', `'result'` becomes `10 + 10 = 20`.\n\n4. **Effect of Changing Condition to 'B'**:\n   - If we change `'condition'` from 'A' to 'B', the logic changes.\n   - For `'value' = 5`:\n     - `'new_value'` still becomes `5 * 2 = 10`.\n     - Since `'condition'` is now 'B', `'result'` becomes `10 - 5 = 5`.\n\nSo, changing the condition from 'A' to 'B' would result in a different output for the same input.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.

It calculates `new_value` as twice the original value.\n4. Depending on the condition:\n   - If `condition` is 'A', it adds 10 to `new_value`.\n   - If `condition` is 'B', it subtracts 5 from `new_value`.\n\nGiven that we can set the 'condition' to 'B' before processing, let's see how this affects the output 'result' for a given 'value'.\n\nFor example, with `input_example = {'value': 5, 'condition': 'B'}`:\n\n1.

Since the condition is 'B', `result` is calculated as `10 - 5 = 5`.\n\nNow, compare this to the case where the condition is 'A':\n\n1. The input value is still 5.\n2. `new_value` is again calculated as `5 * 2 = 10`.\n3. But since the condition is 'A', `result` would be calculated as `10 + 10 = 20`.\n\nSo, setting the condition to 'B' would result in a different output 'result' compared to setting it to 'A'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.
