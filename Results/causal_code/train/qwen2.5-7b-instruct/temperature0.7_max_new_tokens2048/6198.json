    "Let's analyze the `calculateCropYield` method step by step:\n\n1. **Conditions for Crop Yield Calculation:**\n   - If `rainfall > 50` and `fertilizerApplied` is true, then `cropYield = 100`.\n   - If `rainfall > 50` and `fertilizerApplied` is false, then `cropYield = 80`.\n   - If `fertilizerApplied` is true, then `cropYield = 60`.\n   - Otherwise, `cropYield = 30`.\n\n2. **Checking for Crop Yield of 30:**\n   - The only condition where `cropYield` is set to 30 is when none of the above conditions are met.\n   - This means:\n     - `fertilizerApplied` must be false (not true).\n     - And either `rainfall <= 50` or both `rainfall > 50` and `fertilizerApplied` being true would not result in `cropYield = 30`.\n\nGiven these points, if the crop yield is 30, it confirms that:\n- No fertilizer was applied (`fertilizerApplied = false`).\n- The rainfall must be 50mm or less (`rainfall <= 50`).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the `calculateCropYield` method step by step to determine if reducing the crop yield to 30 can indicate both no fertilizer was applied and the rainfall was 50mm or less.\n\n1. **Check for both conditions being met:**\n   - No fertilizer applied (`fertilizerApplied == false`)\n   - Rainfall is 50mm or less (`rainfall <= 50`)\n\n2. **Review the logic in `calculateCropYield`:**\n   - If both `rainfall > 50` and `fertilizerApplied` are true, then `cropYield = 100`.\n   - If only `rainfall > 50` and `fertilizerApplied` is false, then `cropYield = 80`.\n   - If only `fertilizerApplied` is true and `rainfall > 50`, then `cropYield = 60`.\n   - If neither condition is met (i.e., `rainfall <= 50` and `fertilizerApplied` is false), then `cropYield = 30`.\n\n3. **Identify the condition that results in `cropYield = 30`:**\n   - The only condition that matches is when `rainfall <= 50` and `fertilizerApplied` is false.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - For `cropYield` to be 30, it must be the case that:\n     - No fertilizer was applied (`fertilizerApplied == false`)\n     - The rainfall was 50mm or less (`rainfall <= 50`)\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that if the crop yield is reduced to 30, then both conditions (no fertilizer applied and rainfall 50mm or less) must be true.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to understand the conditions under which the `cropYield` is set to 30.\n\n2. Looking at the `calculateCropYield()` method:\n   - The only condition where `cropYield` is explicitly set to 30 is when neither `rainfall` is greater than 50 nor `fertilizerApplied` is true.\n\n3. Let's break it down further:\n   - If `rainfall > 50` and `fertilizerApplied`, `cropYield` is 100.\n   - If `rainfall > 50` but not `fertilizerApplied`, `cropYield` is 80.\n   - If `fertilizerApplied` but not `rainfall > 50`, `cropYield` is 60.\n   - Only when both `rainfall <= 50` and `fertilizerApplied == false`, `cropYield` is 30.\n\n4. Therefore, for `cropYield` to be 30, both conditions must be met:\n   - No fertilizer was applied (`fertilizerApplied == false`).\n   - Rainfall was 50mm or less (`rainfall <= 50`).\n\n5. This directly matches the statement in the question.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the conditions for each possible `cropYield` value:**\n   - `cropYield = 100`: This occurs when `rainfall > 50` and `fertilizerApplied` is true.\n   - `cropYield = 80`: This occurs when `rainfall > 50` and `fertilizerApplied` is false.\n   - `cropYield = 60`: This occurs when `fertilizerApplied` is true and `rainfall <= 50`.\n   - `cropYield = 30`: This occurs under any other combination of conditions.\n\n2. **Analyze the condition where `cropYield = 30`:**\n   - The code states that if none of the above conditions are met, then `cropYield` will be set to 30. This means:\n     - No fertilizer was applied (`fertilizerApplied` is false).\n     - Or, if fertilizer was applied, the rainfall must have been 50mm or less.\n     - If no fertilizer was applied, the rainfall could be any amount, but since we know it reduced the yield to 30, we can infer that the rainfall must have been 50mm or less.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that the `cropYield` is 30, it indicates that either:\n     - No fertilizer was applied (`fertilizerApplied` is false), and the rainfall could be any amount, but typically would be 50mm or less.\n     - Fertilizer was applied, and the rainfall was 50mm or less.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot definitively conclude that both no fertilizer was applied and the rainfall was 50mm or less. The condition `cropYield = 30` only confirms one of these conditions (no fertilizer applied), but not the other (rainfall 50mm or less).\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
