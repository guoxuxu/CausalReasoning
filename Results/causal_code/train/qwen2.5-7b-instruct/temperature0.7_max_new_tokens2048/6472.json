  "Explanation": "Observing that 'willPlantsSurvive()' returns false suggests that it is not raining and the temperature is over 30 degrees.

    "Let's break down the logic in the `willPlantsSurvive()` method:\n\n1. The method checks two conditions:\n   - If it is not raining (`!isRaining`) AND the temperature is greater than 30.\n   - If neither of these conditions is met, it returns `true`.\n\n2. For the method to return `false`, both conditions must be false:\n   - It must be raining (`isRaining` is true).\n   - The temperature must be 30 or less.\n\nGiven this logic, let's consider the scenario where `willPlantsSurvive()` returns `false`:\n- If `willPlantsSurvive()` returns `false`, then it must be raining (`isRaining` is true).\n\nTherefore, observing `willPlantsSurvive()` returning `false` does not allow us to infer that `isRaining` is false; rather, it indicates that `isRaining` is true.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

For `willPlantsSurvive()` to return `false`, both of the following must be true:\n   - It is not raining (`!isRaining`).\n   - The temperature is greater than 30.\n\n3. If we observe that `willPlantsSurvive()` returns `false`, then we can directly infer that it is not raining because the method explicitly checks for `!isRaining`.\n\nTherefore, observing `willPlantsSurvive()` returning `false` does indeed allow us to infer that `isRaining` is false.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The method only returns false when both conditions are met simultaneously. If either condition is not met, it returns true.\n\n5.

We need to determine if observing `willPlantsSurvive()` returning `false` allows us to infer that `isRaining` is `false`.\n\n3. From the given causal relationship:\n   - If `!isRaining` AND `temperature > 30`, then `!willPlantsSurvive()`.\n\n4.

For example, if `isRaining` is `true` and the temperature is less than or equal to 30, `willPlantsSurvive()` would also return `false`.\n\n6. Therefore, while `!isRaining` is one condition that can lead to `willPlantsSurvive()` returning `false`, it is not the only condition.
