    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to determine the cost based on different weather conditions.\n2. The cost is calculated as `cost = electricity_usage * 0.2`.\n\n3.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given code defines how `electricity_usage` is determined based on `weather` and whether `renewable_energy_active` is True.\n\n2. The possible values for `weather` are 'sunny', 'cloudy', and 'rainy'.\n   - If `weather` is 'sunny', `electricity_usage` is set to 120.\n   - If `weather` is 'cloudy', `electricity_usage` is set to 150.\n   - If `weather` is 'rainy', `electricity_usage` is set to 180.\n\n3. If `renewable_energy_active` is True, there's a 25% reduction in `electricity_usage`.\n\n4. The `cost` is calculated as `electricity_usage * 0.2`.\n\n5.

However, the cost can also be high if renewable energy is not active and the weather is 'cloudy' (22.5).\n\n9.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Weather and Electricity Usage Relationship**:\n   - If the weather is sunny, `electricity_usage` is set to 120.\n   - If the weather is cloudy, `electricity_usage` is set to 150.\n   - If the weather is rainy, `electricity_usage` is set to 180.\n\n2. **Renewable Energy Active and Electricity Usage**:\n   - If `renewable_energy_active` is true, `electricity_usage` is reduced by 25%. So, the actual `electricity_usage` becomes 75% of the initial value.\n\n3. **Cost Calculation**:\n   - The cost is calculated as `electricity_usage * 0.2`.\n\nGiven these relationships, we need to determine if a higher observed cost can be inferred to mean the weather was 'rainy'.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **High Cost Scenario**:\n   - A high cost would imply a high `electricity_usage` because the cost is directly proportional to the usage.\n\n2. **Electricity Usage Scenarios**:\n   - Sunny: `electricity_usage` = 120\n   - Cloudy: `electricity_usage` = 150\n   - Rainy: `electricity_usage` = 180\n\n3. **Renewable Energy Impact**:\n   - If `renewable_energy_active` is true, the usage is reduced by 25%.
