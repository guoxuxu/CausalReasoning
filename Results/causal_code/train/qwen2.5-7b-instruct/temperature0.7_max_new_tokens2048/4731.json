    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `SalesAnalysis` class has methods to compute total and average sales.\n2. The `update_sales_data` method takes new sales data and appends it to the existing sales data.\n3. After updating the sales data, it calls `compute_total_sales` and `compute_average_sales` methods.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when `update_sales_data` is called:\n\n1. New sales data is appended to the existing sales data.\n2. `compute_total_sales` is called, which recalculates the total sales based on the updated sales data.\n3. `compute_average_sales` is called, which recalculates the average sales using the new total sales and the updated length of the sales data.\n\nSince both the total sales and the number of data points (length of sales data) can change when new sales data is added, the average sales will indeed be recalculated and potentially change.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `SalesAnalysis` class has methods to compute total and average sales based on provided sales data.\n\n2. The `update_sales_data` method does the following:\n   - Adds new sales data to the existing sales data list.\n   - Calls `compute_total_sales` to recalculate the total sales.\n   - Calls `compute_average_sales` to recalculate the average sales.\n\n3. When `update_sales_data` is called:\n   - It modifies the `sales_data` attribute by appending the new sales data.\n   - This increases both the length of the sales data list and the total sales value.\n   - As a result, `compute_average_sales` will be recalculated using the updated values.\n\n4. Since `compute_average_sales` is explicitly called within `update_sales_data`, and it relies on the most recent values of `total_sales` and `sales_data`, the average sales will indeed change when new data is added.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
