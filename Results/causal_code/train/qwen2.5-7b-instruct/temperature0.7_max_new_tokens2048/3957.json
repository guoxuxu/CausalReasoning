    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `update_temperature` calculates the temperature based on whether cooling is on or off.\n2. If `cooling_on` is True, the temperature is calculated as:\n   `ambient_temp - (system_load * 0.05) * 2`\n3. If `cooling_on` is False, the temperature is calculated as:\n   `ambient_temp + system_load * 0.05`\n4. In the provided example:\n   - `ambient_temp` is 30\n   - `system_load` is 80\n   - `cooling_status` is True\n5. Given these values, the calculation would be:\n   `30 - (80 * 0.05) * 2`\n6. Simplifying:\n   `30 - 4 * 2`\n   `30 - 8`\n   `22`\n7. So, the resultant temperature is 22 when cooling is on.\n8. If cooling was not activated, the temperature would be:\n   `30 + 80 * 0.05`\n   `30 + 4`\n   `34`\n\nGiven that the resultant temperature is lower (22) with cooling activated compared to no cooling (34), we can indeed infer that the cooling was activated if we observe a lower resultant temperature.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `update_temperature` takes two parameters: `sensor_data` and `cooling_on`.\n\n2. The `sensor_data` dictionary contains two keys: `ambient_temperature` and `system_load`.\n\n3. The `cooling_on` parameter is a boolean value that determines whether cooling is applied.\n\n4. If `cooling_on` is True (as in our case), the temperature is calculated as:\n   `temperature = ambient_temp - (system_load * 0.05) * 2`\n   \n   This formula subtracts a certain amount from the ambient temperature based on the system load.\n\n5. If `cooling_on` is False, the temperature would be calculated as:\n   `temperature = ambient_temp + system_load * 0.05`\n   \n   In this case, the temperature would increase based on the system load.\n\n6. Given that `cooling_status` is set to `True`, the temperature will be reduced if the system load is considered.\n\n7. The observed resultant temperature in the snippet is calculated using the provided `sensor_readings` and `cooling_status`.\n\n8. A lower resultant temperature means that the temperature has been reduced.\n\n9.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `update_temperature` takes two arguments: `sensor_data`, which is a dictionary containing ambient temperature and system load, and `cooling_on`, a boolean indicating whether the cooling system is on.\n\n2. **Temperature Calculation**:\n   - If `cooling_on` is `True`, the temperature is calculated as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{temperature} = \\text{ambient\\_temp} - (\\text{system\\_load} \\times 0.05) \\times 2\n     \\]\n   - If `cooling_on` is `False`, the temperature is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{temperature} = \\text{ambient\\_temp} + (\\text{system\\_load} \\times 0.05)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Given Data**:\n   - `sensor_readings = {'ambient_temperature': 30, 'system_load': 80}`\n   - `cooling_status = True`\n\n4. **Calculation**:\n   - Since `cooling_status` is `True`, the function will use the first formula:\n     \\[\n     \\text{temperature} = 30 - (80 \\times 0.05) \\times 2 = 30 - 8 = 22\n     \\]\n\n5. **Observation**:\n   - We observe a resultant temperature of 22.\n\n6. **Inference**:\n   - The formula used to calculate the temperature clearly depends on the value of `cooling_on`. If the cooling was not activated (`cooling_on` would be `False`), the temperature would be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{temperature} = 30 + (80 \\times 0.05) = 30 + 4 = 34\n     \\]\n   - A lower resultant temperature (22) indicates that the cooling was indeed activated.\n\nTherefore, if we observe a lower resultant temperature, we can infer that the cooling was activated post facto.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `update_temperature` calculates the temperature based on whether cooling is on or off.\n2. If `cooling_on` is True, it subtracts from the ambient temperature.\n3. If `cooling_on` is False, it adds to the ambient temperature.\n4. In the provided example, `cooling_status` is set to True.\n5. Given `sensor_readings = {'ambient_temperature': 30, 'system_load': 80}`:\n   - With cooling on, the calculation would be: \n     `30 - (80 * 0.05) * 2 = 30 - 8 = 22`\n6. The resultant temperature is 22, which is lower than the ambient temperature of 30.\n7. To determine if we can infer that cooling was activated post facto from a lower resultant temperature, we need to consider if there are other scenarios where cooling could result in a lower temperature.\n8. However, the code only uses one method for calculating temperature based on the state of cooling.\n9. There's no indication that the function could produce a lower temperature without the cooling being active.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot infer that the cooling was activated post facto just from observing a lower resultant temperature because the function always produces a lower temperature when cooling is on, regardless of when it was activated.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
