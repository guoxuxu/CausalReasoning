  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "During winter, the weather_state() function of WeatherSystem returns 'snowy'. According to the mood() function of Population, if the weather is 'snowy', the mood is 'sluggish'. No intervention was needed, this follows directly from the code's causal paths.",
  "causal_map": "season → weather_state; weather_state → mood",
