    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_salary` calculates the total pay based on the number of hours worked, the hourly rate, a bonus, and whether overtime is applied.\n\n2. When `is_overtime` is False:\n   - The calculation uses the formula: `total_pay = hours_worked * rate_per_hour + bonus`\n\n3. To determine if increasing 'hours_worked' will increase 'total_pay':\n   - We need to consider how each component in the formula changes with more hours worked.\n   - The `rate_per_hour` remains constant.\n   - The `bonus` is also constant and does not change with the number of hours worked.\n   - The term `hours_worked * rate_per_hour` directly increases as 'hours_worked' increases.\n\n4. Therefore, since all other factors remain constant and only the product of hours worked and rate per hour increases linearly with more hours worked, we can conclude that increasing 'hours_worked' will indeed increase 'total_pay'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're dealing with a function `calculate_salary` that calculates an employee's total pay based on various parameters.\n\n2. The key part of the question is when `is_overtime` is False.\n\n3. When `is_overtime` is False:\n   - The function simply calculates `total_pay` as `hours_worked * rate_per_hour + bonus`.\n\n4. Let's break down this calculation:\n   - `hours_worked * rate_per_hour`: This directly depends on the number of hours worked.\n   - `+ bonus`: The bonus is added to the above result, but it doesn't depend on the number of hours worked.\n\n5. Therefore, the only factor that changes with `hours_worked` is `hours_worked * rate_per_hour`.\n\n6. If we increase `hours_worked`, the term `hours_worked * rate_per_hour` will also increase proportionally, assuming `rate_per_hour` remains constant.\n\n7. Since the bonus is a fixed amount and not dependent on `hours_worked`, it doesn't affect the relationship between `hours_worked` and `total_pay`.\n\n8. Thus, increasing `hours_worked` will indeed increase `total_pay` when `is_overtime` is False.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_salary` calculates the total pay based on the number of hours worked, the rate per hour, any bonus, and whether overtime is applicable.\n\n2. When `is_overtime` is False:\n   - The formula used to calculate `total_pay` is `hours_worked * rate_per_hour + bonus`.\n\n3. Let's analyze how each component affects the total pay:\n   - `hours_worked`: This is directly multiplied by `rate_per_hour`.\n   - `rate_per_hour`: This is a constant for the regular working hours.\n   - `bonus`: This is added to the result, but it doesn't depend on the number of hours worked.\n\n4. Since `hours_worked` is directly multiplied by a positive value (`rate_per_hour`), increasing `hours_worked` will indeed increase `total_pay` when `is_overtime` is False.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We need to consider the scenario where 'is_overtime' is False.\n\n2. In this case, the function calculates 'total_pay' as:\n   total_pay = hours_worked * rate_per_hour + bonus\n\n3. Let's break down this formula:\n   - 'hours_worked * rate_per_hour' represents the regular pay for the hours worked.\n   - 'bonus' is added to this amount.\n\n4. If we increase 'hours_worked', both 'hours_worked * rate_per_hour' and 'total_pay' will increase proportionally, assuming 'rate_per_hour' remains constant.\n\n5. The 'bonus' term does not change with 'hours_worked'.\n\n6. Therefore, an increase in 'hours_worked' will directly result in an increase in 'total_pay' when 'is_overtime' is False.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**:\n   - `calculate_salary` takes four parameters: `hours_worked`, `rate_per_hour`, `bonus`, and `is_overtime`.\n   - The function calculates the total pay based on these parameters.\n\n2. **Case When `is_overtime` is False**:\n   - If `is_overtime` is `False`, the function calculates the total pay as follows:\n     - `total_pay = hours_worked * rate_per_hour + bonus`\n   - This means that the total pay is directly proportional to the number of hours worked (`hours_worked * rate_per_hour`) plus a fixed bonus.\n\n3. **Effect of Increasing `hours_worked`**:\n   - If we increase `hours_worked` while keeping `rate_per_hour` and `bonus` constant, the term `hours_worked * rate_per_hour` will increase.\n   - Since the bonus remains constant, any increase in `hours_worked` will result in an increase in `total_pay`.\n\nTherefore, increasing `hours_worked` will indeed increase `total_pay` when `is_overtime` is `False`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
