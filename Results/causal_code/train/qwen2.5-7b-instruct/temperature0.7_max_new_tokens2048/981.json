    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. Initially, the system status is set up with:\n   - Temperature: 25°C\n   - Pressure: 1 atm\n   - Humidity: 50%\n\n2. The `heat_system` method is called with an increase of 10 degrees:\n   - New temperature: 25 + 10 = 35°C\n   - Since the new temperature (35°C) exceeds 30°C, the humidity increases by 5%.\n   - New humidity: 50 + 5 = 55%\n\n3. Next, the `cool_system` method is called with a decrease of 5 degrees:\n   - New temperature: 35 - 5 = 30°C\n   - Since the new temperature (30°C) does not exceed 30°C, no change in humidity.\n\n4. Finally, the `increase_pressure` method is called:\n   - New pressure: 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 atm\n   - Since the new pressure (1.5 atm) exceeds 1.5 atm, the temperature increases by 3°C.\n   - New temperature: 30 + 3 = 33°C\n   - However, since we're only checking if the humidity increased due to the temperature exceeding 30°C, this last step doesn't directly affect our answer about the initial increase in humidity.\n\nThe humidity did indeed increase because the temperature exceeded 30 degrees Celsius during the first call to the `heat_system` method.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
