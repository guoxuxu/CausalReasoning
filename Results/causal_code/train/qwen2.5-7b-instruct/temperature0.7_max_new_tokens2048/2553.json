  "Explanation": "Altering filter_threshold changes which elements of data_list are included in clean_data. A higher threshold excludes more items, potentially lowering the summary, whereas a lower threshold includes more items, potentially increasing the summary. Thus, intervention by modifying filter_threshold directly affects the result.",

    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `process_data` function takes two parameters: `data` (a list of numbers) and `filter_value` (a number used to filter the data).\n\n2. Inside the function, it creates a new list `clean_data` which contains only the elements from `data` that are greater than `filter_value`.\n\n3. It then calculates the average of these filtered values.\n\n4. The `filter_threshold` variable is set to 10, and we pass this value when calling `process_data`.\n\n5. If we change the `filter_threshold`, it directly affects what values are included in the `clean_data` list:\n   - A higher threshold means fewer values will be included in `clean_data`.\n   - A lower threshold means more values will be included in `clean_data`.\n\n6. Since the average (`summary`) is calculated based on the values in `clean_data`, changing the threshold will indeed affect the result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
