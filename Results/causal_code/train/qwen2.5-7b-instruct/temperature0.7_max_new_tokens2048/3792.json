    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `changeWeather` method takes two parameters: `clouds` and `rain`.\n2. If `clouds` is true, it sets `isCloudy` to true.\n3. If `rain` is also true when `clouds` is true, it sets `isRaining` to true and decreases the temperature by 5 degrees.\n4. If `rain` is false when `clouds` is true, it sets `isRaining` to false and increases the temperature by 3 degrees.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific scenario where there are clouds but no rain:\n\n- `clouds` is true\n- `rain` is false\n\nAccording to the logic in the `changeWeather` method:\n- Since `clouds` is true, `isCloudy` is set to true.\n- Since `rain` is false, `isRaining` is set to false.\n- The temperature is increased by 3 degrees because it's not raining despite being cloudy.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the temperature will indeed increase.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `changeWeather` method is called with `clouds` set to `true` and `rain` set to `false`.\n\n2.

Instead, it checks the condition for clearing weather.\n\n4. Since `isCloudy` is now `true` and there is no rain, the method increments the temperature by 3 degrees.\n\nTherefore, given that clouds are present but there is no rain, the temperature will indeed increase by 3 degrees.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
