  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Applying a zero discount rate simply retains the basePrice as the initial value for the finalPrice. When calculateTax is subsequently applied, the introduction of tax affects the finalPrice based on the unchanged basePrice, hence the prior application of a zero discount doesn’t alter the inevitability of a tax increase on the finalPrice.",
  "causal_map": "discountRate → finalPrice; basePrice → finalPrice; taxRate → finalPrice",
  "causal_map_integration": "Setting discountRate to 0 directly prevents any change to finalPrice from applyDiscount, ensuring finalPrice remains unaffected by subsequent calculateTax if discountRate is reset to 0 before tax calculation.",
