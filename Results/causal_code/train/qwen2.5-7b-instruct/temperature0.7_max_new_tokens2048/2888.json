    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `operateTrafficLight` method takes a boolean argument.\n2. If the argument is `true`, it calls `setTrafficLightGreen()`.\n3. `setTrafficLightGreen()` sets the instance variable `isGreen` to `true`.\n4. The `checkIfTrafficIsAllowed()` method simply returns the value of `isGreen`.\n\nGiven that `operateTrafficLight(true)` would set `isGreen` to `true`, calling `checkIfTrafficIsAllowed()` afterward would indeed return `true`.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `isGreen` variable is initially set to `false` in the constructor of the `TrafficLightController` class.\n\n2. **operateTrafficLight Method**:\n   - This method takes a boolean parameter `action`.\n   - If `action` is `true`, it calls `setTrafficLightGreen()`, which sets `isGreen` to `true`.\n   - If `action` is `false`, it sets `isGreen` to `false`.\n\n3. **checkIfTrafficIsAllowed Method**:\n   - This method simply returns the value of `isGreen`.\n\n4. **Question Scenario**:\n   - We are asked what happens if `operateTrafficLight` is called with `true` as an argument.\n   - When `operateTrafficLight(true)` is called, the `if` condition inside the method will be satisfied because `action` is `true`.\n   - As a result, `setTrafficLightGreen()` will be called, setting `isGreen` to `true`.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - After `operateTrafficLight(true)` is called, `isGreen` will be `true`.\n   - When `checkIfTrafficIsAllowed()` is called afterward, it will return the current value of `isGreen`, which is `true`.\n\nTherefore, if the `operateTrafficLight` method is called with `true` as an argument, `checkIfTrafficIsAllowed()` will indeed return `true`.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
