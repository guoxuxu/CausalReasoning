  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Activating the renewable energy source reduces electricity usage by 25%. For 'cloudy' weather (150 * 0.75 = 112.5), the usage would be less than 'sunny' weather usage without intervention (120). Thus, the resultant cost is also lower.",
  "causal_map": "weather → electricity_usage; renewable_energy_active → electricity_usage; weather → cost; renewable_energy_active → cost",
  "causal_map_integration": "During a cloudy day, activating renewable energy reduces electricity usage and cost compared to a sunny day without renewable energy. Weather affects electricity usage, which in turn affects cost. Activating renewable energy further reduces electricity usage and cost.",
