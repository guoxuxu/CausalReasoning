    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have a function `update_sales` that takes three parameters:\n   - `records`: A dictionary containing sales records.\n   - `product`: The product whose sales we want to update.\n   - `percentage_increase`: The percentage by which we want to increase the sales.\n\n2. Inside the function, it checks if the `product` exists in the `records` dictionary:\n   - If it does, it updates the value of that product by multiplying its current value by `(1 + percentage_increase / 100)`.\n   - This means if the original value was `x`, it becomes `x * (1 + percentage_increase / 100)`.\n\n3. The function then returns the updated `records` dictionary.\n\n4. In the provided code:\n   - `sales_records` is initialized as `{'apple': 150, 'banana': 200}`.\n   - `update_sales(sales_records, 'apple', 10)` is called.\n   - This means the sales for 'apple' are increased by 10%.\n\n5. The function modifies the `sales_records` dictionary in place, meaning the actual dictionary object being passed to the function is changed.\n\n6. The `updated_records` variable is assigned the result of calling `update_sales`, which is now the modified `sales_records`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, since `update_sales` modifies the dictionary in place, the `sales_records` dictionary (and therefore `updated_records`) will indeed reflect the change in the value of 'apple'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
