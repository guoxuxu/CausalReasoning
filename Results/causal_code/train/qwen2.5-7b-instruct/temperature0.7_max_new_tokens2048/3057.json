    "Let's break down the code and logic step by step:\n\n1. An `InvestmentPortfolio` object is initialized with an initial investment of 50000.\n2. Funds are then added using the `add_funds` method, increasing the total to 110000.\n3. An attempt is made to invest 40000 using the `make_investment` method.\n\nThe `make_investment` method checks if the current funds (`self.funds`) are greater than or equal to the investment amount. If they are, it subtracts the investment amount from `self.funds` and sets `self.investment_success` to `True`. If not, it sets `self.investment_success` to `False`.\n\nGiven that the funds after adding more money are 110000 and the attempted investment is 40000, the condition `self.funds >= investment_amount` is true. Therefore, the investment should succeed, and there should be no failure.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the investment fails. For the investment to fail, the condition `self.funds >= investment_amount` must be false. This would only happen if the funds available were less than the investment amount.\n\nSince the funds are indeed greater than the investment amount (110000 vs. 40000), the investment does not fail due to insufficient funds.\n\nTherefore, a failure to make an investment does imply that the funds were less than the investment amount originally.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `make_investment` method in the `InvestmentPortfolio` class:\n\n1.

If the condition is false, it sets `self.investment_success` to `False`.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when the investment fails (i.e., `self.investment_success` is `False`):\n\n- For the investment to fail, the funds must be less than the `investment_amount`.\n- If the funds were not less than the investment amount, the funds would be reduced, and the investment would succeed.\n\nTherefore, a failure to make an investment does indeed imply that the funds were less than the investment amount originally.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The `InvestmentPortfolio` instance is created with an initial investment of 50,000.\n2. **Adding Funds**: The `add_funds` method is called with an additional amount of 60,000, bringing the total funds to 110,000.\n3. **Adjusting Risk Profile**: The risk profile is adjusted based on the new fund amount (110,000), which is greater than 100,000, so the risk profile is set to 'High'.\n4. **Making Investment**: The `make_investment` method is called with an investment amount of 40,000. Since the funds (110,000) are indeed greater than the investment amount (40,000), the funds are reduced by 40,000, and `investment_success` is set to `True`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the investment fails:\n\n- If the funds were less than the investment amount, then the `if self.funds >= investment_amount:` condition would fail, and `self.investment_success` would be set to `False`.\n- Conversely, if the funds were greater than or equal to the investment amount, the investment would succeed, and `self.investment_success` would be set to `True`.\n\nGiven the code logic, a failure to make an investment (`self.investment_success = False`) does indeed imply that the funds were less than the investment amount.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The `InvestmentPortfolio` instance is created with an initial investment of $50,000.\n2. **Adding Funds**: The `add_funds` method is called with an additional $60,000, making the total funds $110,000.\n3. **Risk Profile Adjustment**: Since the total funds are now greater than $100,000, the risk profile is set to 'High'.\n4. **Making an Investment**: The `make_investment` method is called with an investment amount of $40,000.\n\nThe `make_investment` method checks if the available funds (`self.funds`) are greater than or equal to the investment amount. If they are, it deducts the investment amount from `self.funds` and sets `self.investment_success` to `True`. Otherwise, it sets `self.investment_success` to `False`.\n\nGiven the code provided, we can see that the funds after adding the extra amount are $110,000, which is greater than the investment amount of $40,000. Therefore, the condition `self.funds >= investment_amount` is true, and the investment should succeed.\n\nHowever, the question asks about the scenario where an investment fails (`self.investment_success = False`). According to the logic in the `make_investment` method, an investment will fail only if `self.funds < investment_amount`.\n\nTo directly answer the question: Does a failure to make an investment imply that the funds were less than the investment amount originally?\n\n- Based on the provided code and logic, yes, a failure to make an investment (i.e., `self.investment_success = False`) implies that the funds were indeed less than the investment amount originally.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The `InvestmentPortfolio` is initialized with an initial investment of 50,000.\n2. **Adding Funds**: We add 60,000 to the existing funds, making the total funds 110,000.\n3. **Adjusting Risk Profile**: Since the funds exceed 100,000, the risk profile is set to 'High'.\n4. **Making an Investment**: We attempt to make an investment of 40,000.\n\nNow, let's analyze the condition under which the investment fails:\n\n- The method `make_investment` checks if `self.funds >= investment_amount`.\n- If the condition is true, the investment is made, and `self.investment_success` is set to `True`.\n- If the condition is false, the investment is not made, and `self.investment_success` is set to `False`.\n\nGiven the scenario where we have 110,000 funds and an investment amount of 40,000, the condition `self.funds >= investment_amount` is true, so the investment should succeed. However, the question asks if a failure to make an investment implies that the funds were less than the investment amount.\n\nSince the funds (110,000) are greater than the investment amount (40,000), the failure must be due to some other reason not specified in the provided code snippet. Therefore, based on the given information, a failure to make an investment does indeed imply that the funds were less than the investment amount.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `make_investment` method checks if `self.funds >= investment_amount`.\n\n2. If this condition is true (i.e., `self.funds >= investment_amount`), then:\n   - The funds are reduced by the investment amount.\n   - `self.investment_success` is set to `True`.\n\n3. If this condition is false (i.e., `self.funds < investment_amount`), then:\n   - `self.investment_success` is set to `False`.\n\n4. The question asks if a failure to make an investment (`self.investment_success = False`) implies that the funds were less than the investment amount originally.\n\n5. Based on the logic in the `make_investment` method, we can see that `self.investment_success = False` directly results from `self.funds < investment_amount`.\n\n6. Therefore, if `self.investment_success` is `False`, it must be because the funds were indeed less than the investment amount.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The `InvestmentPortfolio` class is initialized with an initial investment of 50,000.\n\n2. **Adding Funds**: We then add 60,000 to the initial investment, bringing the total funds to 110,000. This triggers the adjustment of the risk profile to 'High'.\n\n3. **Making an Investment**: We attempt to make an investment of 40,000. According to the logic in the `make_investment` method, the check `if self.funds >= investment_amount:` is performed. Since `self.funds` (110,000) is indeed greater than or equal to the `investment_amount` (40,000), the investment is successful, and `self.investment_success` is set to `True`.\n\n4. **Risk Profile Adjustment**: After making the investment, the risk profile is adjusted again due to the call to `adjust_risk_profile()`. However, since the funds remain above 100,000, the risk profile remains 'High'.\n\nGiven this sequence of events, we can conclude that the investment was successful because the funds were sufficient. Therefore, a failure to make an investment would imply that the funds were not sufficient, i.e., `self.funds < investment_amount`.\n\nHowever, the problem statement specifically asks about the case where the investment is made successfully, which is not the scenario described here. If we consider the general rule given (`self.funds < investment_amount → self.investment_success = False`), then yes, a failure to make an investment would imply that the funds were less than the investment amount originally.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
