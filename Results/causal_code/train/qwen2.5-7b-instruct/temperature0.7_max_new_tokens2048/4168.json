    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `process_data` method filters the input `data` based on a `filter_threshold`.\n2. It then normalizes the filtered data by dividing each value by 100.\n3. The `analyze_data` method calculates the average of these normalized values.\n\nNow, let's consider modifying the `normalized_data` to include only values higher than a new threshold:\n\n4. If we modify `normalized_data` to include only values higher than a new threshold, we would be altering the dataset that `analyze_data` uses to calculate the average.\n5. Since the `analyze_data` method calculates the average by summing all elements in `normalized_data` and dividing by the length of `normalized_data`, any change in the values or count of elements in `normalized_data` will affect the resulting average.\n\nTherefore, yes, modifying the `normalized_data` to include only values higher than a new threshold would indeed affect the 'average' calculated in `analyze_data`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
