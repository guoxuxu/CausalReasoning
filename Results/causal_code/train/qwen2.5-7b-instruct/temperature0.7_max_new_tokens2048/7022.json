    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `Weather` class is defined with an `__init__` method that initializes the temperature.\n2. The `is_rainy` method checks if the temperature is less than 20 degrees and returns `True` if it is, otherwise `False`.\n3. The `decide_outfit` function uses the result of `is_rainy` to determine the outfit:\n   - If `weather.is_rainy()` returns `True`, it returns 'raincoat'.\n   - Otherwise, it returns 't-shirt'.\n\nGiven that the temperature is set to 18 degrees, which is below 20 degrees:\n- The `is_rainy` method for the current weather instance will return `True`.\n- Therefore, `decide_outfit` will return 'raincoat'.\n\nSince the temperature is indeed below 20 degrees, a raincoat will be chosen without any intervention.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

The `is_rainy` method checks if the temperature is less than 20 degrees and returns `True` if it is, otherwise `False`.\n3. The `decide_outfit` function takes a `Weather` object as input and uses its `is_rainy` method to determine the outfit.\n4. If `is_rainy` returns `True`, it means the temperature is below 20 degrees, and the function returns 'raincoat'.\n5. If `is_rainy` returns `False`, it means the temperature is 20 degrees or higher, and the function returns 't-shirt'.\n\nNow, let's look at the specific scenario:\n- The temperature is set to 18 degrees.\n- A `Weather` object is created with this temperature.\n- The `decide_outfit` function is called with this `Weather` object.\n\nSince the temperature is 18 degrees (which is below 20), the `is_rainy` method will return `True`.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `Weather` class is defined with an `__init__` method that takes a temperature as input and stores it in an instance variable.\n\n2. The `is_rainy` method checks if the stored temperature is less than 20 degrees. If so, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n3. The `decide_outfit` function takes a `Weather` object as input. It calls the `is_rainy` method on this object.\n\n4. If `is_rainy()` returns `True`, `decide_outfit` returns `'raincoat'`. Otherwise, it returns `'t-shirt'`.\n\n5. In the provided code, the temperature is set to 18 degrees, which is below 20 degrees.\n\n6. When we create a `Weather` object with this temperature and pass it to `decide_outfit`, the `is_rainy` method will return `True` because 18 is indeed less than 20.\n\n7. As a result, `decide_outfit` will return `'raincoat'`.\n\nGiven this reasoning, if the temperature is below 20 degrees (as in the case of 18 degrees), a raincoat will be chosen without any intervention.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
