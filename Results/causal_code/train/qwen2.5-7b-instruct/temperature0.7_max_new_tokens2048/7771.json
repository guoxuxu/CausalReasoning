  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Under non-holiday conditions, `final_sales` directly incorporates the `marketing_spend` multiplied by 0.2 in its formula. Therefore, increasing the `marketing_spend` will directly increase `final_sales`, assuming it is not a holiday.",
  "causal_map": "marketing_spend → final_sales; holiday → final_sales",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing marketing spend directly increases final sales, while a holiday increases final sales multiplicatively. Therefore, if marketing spend is increased, final sales will generally increase unless a holiday causes a multiplicative increase that outweighs the additive effect of increased spend.",
