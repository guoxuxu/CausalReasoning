  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "A bonus of 500 can be issued under two circumstances: Sales above 50000 with an attendance rate below 0.95 (mid-tier bonus for high sales), or sales between 20001 and 50000 with an attendance rate above 0.90. Hence, knowing the bonus alone does not precisely inform us of the sales range.",
  "causal_map": "sales > 20000 → bonus = 500; sales <= 20000 → bonus = 0",
  "causal_map_integration": "If an employee's sales are greater than 20000 and their attendance rate meets the condition for a 500 bonus, their bonus will be 500. Otherwise, if their sales are 20000 or less, their bonus will be 0.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `calculate_bonus` method determines the bonus based on two factors: sales and attendance rate.\n\n2. The bonus calculation logic is as follows:\n   - If sales > 50000:\n     - If attendance_rate >= 0.95, bonus = 1000\n     - Else, bonus = 500\n   - If 20000 < sales <= 50000:\n     - If attendance_rate >= 0.90, bonus = 500\n     - Else, bonus = 200\n   - If sales <= 20000:\n     - bonus = 0\n\n3. We need to determine if an employee with a bonus of 500 had sales below 50000.\n\n4. From the logic, we see that:\n   - A bonus of 500 can be achieved in two scenarios:\n     1. Sales > 20000 and attendance_rate >= 0.90\n     2. Sales > 50000 and attendance_rate < 0.95\n\n5. Therefore, a bonus of 500 does not necessarily mean the sales were below 50000. It could have been above 20000 but below 50000 with an attendance rate of at least 0.90.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The bonus calculation logic is defined in the `calculate_bonus` method of the `Employee` class.\n\n2. We need to consider the conditions under which a bonus of 500 is awarded:\n   - If sales are greater than 50000 and attendance rate is >= 0.95, the bonus is 1000.\n   - If sales are between 20000 and 50000 (inclusive) and attendance rate is >= 0.90, the bonus is 500.\n   - If sales are between 20000 and 50000 but attendance rate is < 0.90, the bonus is 200.\n   - If sales are below 20000, the bonus is 0.\n\n3. To get a bonus of exactly 500, the employee must have:\n   - Sales between 20000 and 50000 (inclusive)\n   - An attendance rate of at least 0.90\n\n4. This means that if an employee gets a bonus of 500, their sales must be within the range of 20000 to 50000, but not above 50000.\n\n5. Therefore, if an employee's bonus is 500, we can conclude that their sales were definitely below 50000.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `calculate_bonus` method determines the bonus based on two factors: sales and attendance rate.\n\n2. If an employee's bonus is 500, we need to check which conditions could lead to this bonus amount.\n\n3. The bonus of 500 can occur in two scenarios:\n   - When sales are between 20000 and 50000, and the attendance rate is at least 0.90.\n   - When sales are less than or equal to 20000, regardless of the attendance rate.\n\n4. We need to determine if the sales being definitely below 50000 can be inferred from a bonus of 500.\n\n5. From the above points, we see that even if sales are between 20000 and 50000 (but not more than 50000), the bonus can still be 500 if the attendance rate meets the requirement.\n\n6. Therefore, just because an employee's bonus is 500, it does not definitively mean their sales were below 50000. Sales could have been between 20000 and 50000 as long as the attendance rate was at least 0.90.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The bonus calculation logic is defined in the `calculate_bonus` method.\n2. If an employee's bonus is 500, we need to check which condition in the `calculate_bonus` method would result in a bonus of 500.\n\nFrom the code:\n- If sales > 50000 and attendance_rate >= 0.95, bonus = 1000\n- If sales > 20000 and attendance_rate >= 0.90, bonus = 500\n- If sales <= 20000, bonus = 0\n\n3. Since we know the bonus is 500, it must be from the second condition:\n   - `sales > 20000` AND `attendance_rate >= 0.90`\n\n4. This means the sales are not definitely below 50000, as they could be between 20000 and 50000 (inclusive).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the sales were definitely below 50000 if the bonus is 500.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `calculate_bonus` method has different conditions based on the sales amount and attendance rate.\n\n2. For a bonus of 500, there are two scenarios:\n   - Sales > 20000 and attendance_rate >= 0.90\n   - Sales <= 20000 (which means it's not above 50000)\n\n3. If the sales were definitely above 50000, the bonus would be either 1000 or 500 depending on the attendance rate. Therefore, a bonus of 500 cannot occur if sales are above 50000 because that would result in a bonus of at least 1000.\n\n4. So, for a bonus of exactly 500, the only possibility is that the sales are between 20000 and 50000, inclusive, and the attendance rate meets the specified threshold.\n\n5. This means that if an employee's bonus is 500, we can indeed infer that their sales were definitely below 50000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
