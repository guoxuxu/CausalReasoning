    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `multiply` function takes two inputs and returns their product.\n2. The `add` function takes two inputs and returns their sum.\n3. In the `processInputs` function:\n   - It first multiplies `a` and `b` using `multiply(a, b)`.\n   - Then it adds `a` to the result of that multiplication using `add(multiply(a, b), a)`.\n\nGiven:\n- `inputA` is initially 10\n- `inputB` is 5\n\nLet's calculate the initial result:\n1. `tempResult = multiply(10, 5) = 50`\n2. `result = add(50, 10) = 60`\n\nNow, if `inputA` increases while `inputB` remains constant (still 5):\n1. Let's assume `inputA` becomes 20.\n2. `tempResult = multiply(20, 5) = 100`\n3. `result = add(100, 20) = 120`\n\nWe can see that when `inputA` increased from 10 to 20, the result increased from 60 to 120.\n\nTherefore, if `inputA` increases, the value of `result` will also increase, assuming `inputB` remains constant.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `processInputs` function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`.\n2. Inside this function:\n   - It multiplies `a` and `b` using the `multiply` function.\n   - It then adds `a` to the result of the multiplication using the `add` function.\n3. The formula for `result` can be expressed as: \n   \\[ \\text{result} = (a \\times b) + a \\]\n4. Given that `inputA` is initially set to 10 and `inputB` is set to 5:\n   - The initial `result` would be: \\( (10 \\times 5) + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \\)\n5. If we increase `inputA` while keeping `inputB` constant:\n   - For example, if `inputA` becomes 20, the new `result` would be: \\( (20 \\times 5) + 20 = 100 + 20 = 120 \\)\n6. Comparing the two scenarios:\n   - Initial result: 60\n   - New result with increased `inputA`: 120\n7. We can see that increasing `inputA` results in an increase in `result`.\n\nTherefore, if the value of `inputA` increases, the value of `result` will also increase, assuming `inputB` remains constant.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Given the initial values:\n   - `inputA = 10`\n   - `inputB = 5`\n4. When calling `processInputs(inputA, inputB)`:\n   - `tempResult = multiply(10, 5) = 50`\n   - `result = add(50, 10) = 60`\n   - So, `result = 60`\n5. Now, let's consider what happens if `inputA` increases while `inputB` remains constant:\n   - If `inputA` increases, say to `15`, and `inputB` remains `5`:\n     - `tempResult = multiply(15, 5) = 75`\n     - `result = add(75, 15) = 90`\n     - In this case, `result` would be `90`, which is greater than `60`.\n\nTherefore, if `inputA` increases and `inputB` remains constant, the value of `result` will also increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Let's break down the formula used:\n   - `tempResult = a * b`\n   - `result = (a * b) + a`\n5. If we increase the value of `inputA` (let's call the new value `a'`), the new calculation becomes:\n   - `tempResult' = a' * b`\n   - `result' = (a' * b) + a'`\n6. Comparing the old and new results:\n   - Old result: `(a * b) + a`\n   - New result: `(a' * b) + a'`\n7. Since `a' > a` and `b` remains constant, both `(a' * b)` and `a'` will be greater than their respective counterparts in the old result.\n8.
