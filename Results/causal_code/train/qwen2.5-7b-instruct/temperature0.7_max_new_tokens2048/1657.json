  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Although the rule caps the bonus at $10,000, the increase in the performance rating from 7 to 10 increases the bonus percentage from 10% to 20%. If the salary and initial bonus were such that the initial bonus was below $10,000, the increase in rating would still enhance the bonus until the cap is reached.",
  "causal_map": "performance_rating → bonus; salary → bonus",
  "causal_map_integration": "Performance rating and salary both directly determine the bonus amount. An increase in performance rating leads to a higher bonus, up to a maximum capped at $10,000, with salary also influencing the bonus amount.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Performance Rating (7):**\n   - The function `calculate_bonus(salary, performance_rating)` checks the `performance_rating`.\n   - For `performance_rating` of 7, it falls into the \"else\" condition because 7 is not greater than 5.\n   - Therefore, the bonus calculation for `performance_rating` 7 would be `bonus = 0`.\n\n2. **New Performance Rating (10):**\n   - With the new `performance_rating` of 10, we need to check the conditions again.\n   - Since 10 is greater than 8, it falls into the first condition.\n   - The bonus calculation becomes `bonus = salary * 0.2`.\n   - Given `salary = 50000`, the bonus would be `50000 * 0.2 = 10000`.\n\n3. **Bonus Cap at $10,000:**\n   - If a rule is added to cap bonuses at $10,000, then even if the calculated bonus is more than $10,000, it will be capped at $10,000.\n   - In our case, the calculated bonus is exactly $10,000, so it would remain $10,000 after applying the cap.\n\n4. **Comparison of Bonuses:**\n   - Initial bonus for `performance_rating` 7: $0\n   - New bonus for `performance_rating` 10 (after capping): $10,000\n\nThe increase in the bonus is evident as the bonus goes from $0 to $10,000.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Scenario (Performance Rating = 7):**\n   - According to the function, for a performance rating of 7, which falls into the condition `performance_rating > 5`, the bonus is calculated as `salary * 0.1`.\n   - With a salary of $50,000, the bonus would be \\(50000 \\times 0.1 = 5000\\).\n\n2. **New Rule Implementation:**\n   - The new rule caps the bonus at $10,000.\n   - If the performance rating increases to 10, the original logic would still apply, but with the cap.\n\n3. **Scenario with Increased Performance Rating (Performance Rating = 10):**\n   - For a performance rating of 10, which is greater than 8, the bonus would be calculated as `salary * 0.2`.\n   - With a salary of $50,000, the bonus would be \\(50000 \\times 0.2 = 10000\\).\n   - However, due to the cap, the actual bonus would be capped at $10,000.\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - Initial bonus (rating = 7) = $5,000\n   - New bonus (rating = 10) after capping = $10,000\n\nThe bonus does indeed increase from $5,000 to $10,000 when the performance rating increases from 7 to 10, considering the cap.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Scenario (Performance Rating = 7):**\n   - The function `calculate_bonus` checks the performance rating.\n   - Since the rating is between 5 and 8 (not greater than 8), it falls into the second condition.\n   - The bonus calculation is `bonus = salary * 0.1`.\n   - With a salary of $50,000, the bonus would be `50000 * 0.1 = $5,000`.\n\n2. **New Rule Added: Cap Bonuses at $10,000:**\n   - If the new rule caps bonuses at $10,000, then regardless of the performance rating, the maximum bonus will be $10,000.\n\n3. **New Scenario (Performance Rating = 10):**\n   - Even though the performance rating has increased to 10, which would normally result in a higher bonus (since it's greater than 8), the new rule caps the bonus at $10,000.\n   - Therefore, the bonus remains capped at $10,000.\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - Initially, with a rating of 7, the bonus was $5,000.\n   - With the new rule and a rating of 10, the bonus is still capped at $10,000.\n   - There is no increase in the bonus due to the performance rating increasing from 7 to 10 because the new rule caps all bonuses at $10,000.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to the question \"Is the bonus increase evident?\" is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
