    "Let's break down the function `update_score` step by step to determine if a person younger than 18 who has completed training will have their score increased.\n\n1. The function takes three parameters:\n   - `age`: The age of the person.\n   - `score`: The current score.\n   - `training_completed`: A boolean indicating whether the person has completed training.\n\n2. The first condition checks if the person is older than 18:\n   - If `age > 18`, then `score` increases by 10.\n   \n3. The second condition checks if the person has completed training:\n   - If `training_completed` is `True`, then `score` increases by 20.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the scenario where a person is younger than 18 (i.e., `age <= 18`) and has completed training (`training_completed = True`):\n   - The first condition `if age > 18` will be `False`, so no points are added here.\n   - However, the second condition `if training_completed` will be `True`, so `score` will increase by 20.\n\nTherefore, even though the person is younger than 18, they will still have their score increased by 20 points due to completing the training.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `update_score` takes three parameters: `age`, `score`, and `training_completed`.\n\n2.

We need to determine what happens when a person is younger than 18 years old (`age < 18`) and has completed training (`training_completed = True`).\n\n4. Since the condition `age > 18` is not met (the person is younger than 18), the first part of the `if` statement does not execute.\n\n5. However, since `training_completed` is `True`, the second part of the `if` statement will execute, adding 20 to the `score`.\n\nTherefore, even though the person is younger than 18, their score will still increase by 20 due to completing the training.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
