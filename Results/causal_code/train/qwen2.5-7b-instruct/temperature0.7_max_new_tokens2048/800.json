    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_performance` calculates the return on investment (ROI) based on the given income and marketing spend.\n\n2. The formula for ROI is:\n   \\[\n   ROI = \\frac{Sales - MarketingSpend}{MarketingSpend}\n   \\]\n   where\n   \\[\n   Sales = Income \\times 0.5\n   \\]\n\n3. Substituting the expression for Sales into the ROI formula gives:\n   \\[\n   ROI = \\frac{(Income \\times 0.5) - MarketingSpend}{MarketingSpend}\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplifying the equation:\n   \\[\n   ROI = \\frac{0.5 \\times Income - MarketingSpend}{MarketingSpend} = 0.5 \\times \\frac{Income}{MarketingSpend} - 1\n   \\]\n\n5. From this equation, we can see that the ROI depends on two factors:\n   - \\(0.5 \\times \\frac{Income}{MarketingSpend}\\): This term increases as Income increases.\n   - \\(-1\\): This term remains constant.\n\n6. However, the increase in Income does not necessarily result in a proportional increase in ROI because of the subtraction of 1.\n\n7. Consider an example:\n   - If Income = 80000 and MarketingSpend = 5000, then:\n     \\[\n     ROI = 0.5 \\times \\frac{80000}{5000} - 1 = 0.5 \\times 16 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\n     \\]\n   - If Income increases to 100000 and MarketingSpend remains 5000, then:\n     \\[\n     ROI = 0.5 \\times \\frac{100000}{5000} - 1 = 0.5 \\times 20 - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9\n     \\]\n   \n   In this case, increasing Income from 80000 to 100000 does indeed increase ROI from 7 to 9.\n\n8. But consider another scenario:\n   - If Income = 100000 and MarketingSpend = 10000, then:\n     \\[\n     ROI = 0.5 \\times \\frac{100000}{10000} - 1 = 0.5 \\times 10 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4\n     \\]\n   - If Income increases to 120000 and MarketingSpend remains 10000, then:\n     \\[\n     ROI = 0.5 \\times \\frac{120000}{10000} - 1 = 0.5 \\times 12 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\n     \\]\n   \n   Here, increasing Income from 100000 to 120000 does not increase ROI; it stays the same at 5.\n\nGiven these examples, we can see that while an increase in Income generally leads to an increase in ROI, the relationship is not always strictly positive due to the subtraction of 1 in the ROI formula. Therefore, an increase in Income does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in ROI.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_performance` calculates:\n   - Sales as 50% of income (`sales = income * 0.5`)\n   - Profit as sales minus marketing spend (`profit = sales - marketing_spend`)\n   - Return on investment (ROI) as profit divided by marketing spend (`ROI = profit / marketing_spend`)\n\n2. To determine if the ROI will necessarily increase with an increase in yearly income, we need to see how each component of the ROI formula changes.\n\n3. If `yearly_income` increases:\n   - Sales will also increase proportionally (since `sales = income * 0.5`).\n   - The numerator of the ROI formula (profit) will increase because both sales and marketing spend remain directly proportional to the original income.\n   - The denominator (marketing spend) remains constant.\n\n4. Since the numerator (profit) is increasing while the denominator (marketing spend) stays constant, the overall value of ROI should increase.\n\n5. However, it's important to note that this is true only if the marketing spend remains constant. If marketing spend also increases with income (e.g., due to scaling up marketing efforts), the relationship could be more complex.\n\nGiven the information provided and assuming marketing spend does not change with income, the ROI should indeed increase with an increase in yearly income.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `sales_performance` calculates the return on investment (ROI) based on the given income and marketing spend.\n\n2. The formula for ROI is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ROI} = \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Marketing Spend}} = \\frac{\\text{Sales} - \\text{Marketing Spend}}{\\text{Marketing Spend}}\n   \\]\n   \n3. Given that:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sales} = \\text{Income} \\times 0.5\n   \\]\n   We can substitute this into the ROI formula:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ROI} = \\frac{0.5 \\times \\text{Income} - \\text{Marketing Spend}}{\\text{Marketing Spend}}\n   \\]\n\n4. Now, let's consider what happens if we increase the yearly income while keeping the marketing budget constant:\n   - The numerator (profit) will increase because it's directly proportional to income.\n   - The denominator remains the same (marketing spend).\n\n5. However, the increase in the numerator isn't necessarily proportional to the increase in the denominator. The relationship between income and ROI depends on how much the income increases relative to the marketing spend.\n\n6. To determine if ROI necessarily increases, we need to consider the scenario where the increase in income doesn't proportionally increase the sales enough to offset the marketing spend.\n\n7. For example, if the income increases by a small amount, the sales (which is 50% of income) might not increase significantly, potentially leading to a decrease in ROI if the marketing spend remains the same.\n\nTherefore, an increase in yearly income does not necessarily lead to an increase in return on investment.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the function**:\n   - `sales_performance` calculates the Return on Investment (ROI) based on the input parameters: `income` and `marketing_spend`.\n   - The formula used is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{sales} = \\text{income} \\times 0.5\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{profit} = \\text{sales} - \\text{marketing\\_spend}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{ROI} = \\frac{\\text{profit}}{\\text{marketing\\_spend}}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Analyze how ROI changes with increasing income**:\n   - If `yearly_income` increases, then `sales` will also increase proportionally since `sales = yearly_income * 0.5`.\n   - The `profit` is calculated as `sales - marketing_spend`. Since `sales` increases when `yearly_income` increases, `profit` will also increase.\n   - The ROI is the ratio of `profit` to `marketing_spend`. As both `profit` and `marketing_spend` are directly proportional to each other (with `marketing_spend` being constant), an increase in `yearly_income` will lead to a corresponding increase in `profit`, which will result in an increase in ROI.\n\n3. **Consider edge cases**:\n   - If `marketing_spend` remains constant and `yearly_income` increases, the relationship between `profit` and `ROI` will still hold true because the numerator (`profit`) increases while the denominator (`marketing_spend`) stays the same.\n\nGiven this analysis, if `yearly_income` increases, `return_on_investment` will indeed increase, assuming `marketing_spend` remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. The function `sales_performance` calculates the return on investment (ROI) based on the input parameters `income` and `marketing_spend`.\n\n2. The formula for ROI is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ROI} = \\frac{\\text{Sales} - \\text{Marketing Spend}}{\\text{Marketing Spend}}\n   \\]\n\n3. Sales are calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sales} = \\text{Income} \\times 0.5\n   \\]\n\n4. Therefore, the ROI can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ROI} = \\frac{0.5 \\times \\text{Income} - \\text{Marketing Spend}}{\\text{Marketing Spend}}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\text{ROI} = \\frac{0.5 \\times \\text{Income}}{\\text{Marketing Spend}} - 1\n   \\]\n\n5. From the above formula, we can see that the ROI depends on both the `income` and the `marketing_spend`. Specifically, the ROI increases as the `income` increases, but it also depends on the `marketing_spend`.\n\n6. If the `marketing_spend` remains constant and the `income` increases, the term \\(\\frac{0.5 \\times \\text{Income}}{\\text{Marketing Spend}}\\) will increase, leading to an increase in ROI.\n\n7. However, if the `marketing_spend` also increases proportionally with the `income`, the effect might be mitigated. For example, if `income` doubles and `marketing_spend` also doubles, the ROI would remain unchanged because the numerator and denominator would increase by the same factor.\n\nGiven this analysis, the ROI does not necessarily increase if only the `yearly_income` increases; it depends on how the `marketing_budget` changes relative to the increase in `yearly_income`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
