    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `add_item` method takes two parameters: `item` and `price`.\n\n2. Inside the method:\n   - The item is appended to the `items` list.\n   - The `total_cost` is incremented by the `price` of the added item.\n\n3. This means that every time `add_item` is called, it directly modifies the `total_cost` by adding the specified price.\n\n4. Since the `total_cost` is increased by the exact amount of the item's price each time `add_item` is called, we can conclude that the total cost will indeed increase after calling `add_item`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
