    "Let's break down the scenario step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We have a `WeatherStation` instance (`weatherStation1`) that uses an initial `WeatherSystem` instance (`weatherSystem1`).\n   - The initial `WeatherSystem` is of type 'Tropical' with humidity 85 and temperature 29.\n   - Using `predictWeather(3)`, the initial prediction is made based on the current `WeatherSystem`.\n\n2. **Update Weather System**:\n   - We forcefully update the `WeatherStation`'s `WeatherSystem` to a new instance (`weatherSystem2`) of type 'Desert' with humidity 50 and temperature 35.\n\n3. **New Prediction**:\n   - After updating the `WeatherSystem`, we use `predictWeather(3)` again to get the new prediction.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conditions for each weather type in the `forecast` method of the `WeatherSystem` class:\n\n- **Sunny**: If the temperature is greater than 30.\n- **Rainy**: If the humidity is greater than 80.\n- **Cloudy**: Otherwise (neither of the above conditions are met).\n\nFor the updated `WeatherSystem`:\n- Type: Desert\n- Humidity: 50\n- Temperature: 35\n\nGiven these values:\n- The temperature (35) is greater than 30, which satisfies the condition for predicting 'Sunny'.\n\nTherefore, after updating the `WeatherSystem` to 'Desert' type with high temperature (35), the weather prediction will indeed change to 'Sunny'.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with `weatherSystem1` which is a Tropical system with humidity 85 and temperature 29.\n2. The initial prediction (`currentWeatherPrediction`) is made using `weatherSystem1`.\n3. We then update the weather system to a Desert type with humidity 50 and temperature 35 using `updateWeather`.\n4. A new prediction (`newWeatherPrediction`) is made using the updated `weatherSystem2`.\n\nNow, let's check the conditions for each prediction:\n\nFor `currentWeatherPrediction`:\n- Temperature is 29 (not > 30), so it won't be 'Sunny'.\n- Humidity is 85 (> 80), so it will be 'Rainy'.\n\nFor `newWeatherPrediction`:\n- Temperature is 35 (> 30), so it will be 'Sunny'.\n- Humidity is 50 (not > 80), so it won't affect the prediction.\n\nTherefore, after updating to a Desert type with high temperature, the weather prediction does indeed change to 'Sunny'.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
