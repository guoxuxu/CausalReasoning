    "Let's break down the code and the logic step by step:\n\n1. A `Vehicle` class is defined with a constructor that takes a `type` parameter.\n2. The `setFuelType` method sets the `fuelType` property of the instance.\n3. The `startEngine` method checks the `fuelType`:\n   - If it's 'electric', it logs 'Electric engine started'.\n   - Otherwise, it logs 'Combustion engine started'.\n\nNow, let's look at how the object `car` is created and used:\n\n1. `const car = new Vehicle('Car');` creates an instance of the `Vehicle` class with the type 'Car'.\n2. `car.setFuelType('diesel');` sets the `fuelType` to 'diesel'.\n3. `car.startEngine();` calls the `startEngine` method.\n\nThe `startEngine` method will check the `fuelType`. Since `fuelType` is set to 'diesel', the message logged will be 'Combustion engine started'.\n\nGiven that the output is 'Electric engine started', this indicates that the `fuelType` must have been set to 'electric'.
