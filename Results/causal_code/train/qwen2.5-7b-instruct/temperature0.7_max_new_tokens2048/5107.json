  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Since the temperature is above 20 degrees, it would trigger the 'Warm day' message in the 'simulateDay' method, assuming no change or only a minor change in temperature that does not bring temperature below 21 degrees.",
  "causal_map": "temperature > 20 → Warm day; isRainy → Rainy day",
  "causal_map_integration": "If the temperature is greater than 20, it will be considered a warm day; if it is rainy, it will be considered a rainy day.",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Temperature**: The initial temperature is 25 degrees.\n2. **No Intervention**: There is no mention of any change in temperature due to external factors such as the `updateWeather` method being called with a `deltaTemp`. Therefore, we assume the temperature remains at 25 degrees.\n3. **Weather Simulator's Logic**:\n   - The `simulateDay` method checks if the temperature is greater than 20 degrees.\n   - If the temperature is greater than 20 degrees, it prints \"Warm day\".\n   - If the temperature is 20 degrees or less, it prints \"Cool day\".\n\nGiven that the initial temperature is 25 degrees and there is no intervention to change this, the condition `if (temperature > 20)` will evaluate to true.\n\nTherefore, it would indeed be a warm day.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
