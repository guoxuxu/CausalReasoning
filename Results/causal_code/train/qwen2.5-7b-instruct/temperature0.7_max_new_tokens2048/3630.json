  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Setting the flag to 'clean' leads to the call of remove_outliers function, which eliminates data points outside the specified range (10, 90). Thus, no outliers will be in the processed data when the flag is 'clean'.",
