    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `weather_condition` function returns one of three possible weather conditions: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. The `decide_on_activity` function takes the weather as input and decides on an activity based on that weather:\n   - If the weather is 'sunny', the activity is set to 'go to the park'.\n   - If the weather is 'rainy', the activity is set to 'watch movies'.\n   - If the weather is 'cloudy', the activity is set to 'visit a museum'.\n\n3. Given that the question states \"the weather turns out to be sunny,\" we can directly refer to the logic in the `decide_on_activity` function.\n\n4.
