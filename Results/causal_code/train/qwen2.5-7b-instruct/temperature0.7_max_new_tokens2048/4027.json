    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `increase_sales` takes two parameters: `price_reduction` and `advertising_boost`.\n\n2. It starts with an initial sales value of 100.\n\n3. If `price_reduction` is greater than 0, it adds 10 times the `price_reduction` to the sales.\n\n4. If `advertising_boost` is greater than 0, it adds 15 times the `advertising_boost` to the sales.\n\n5. Given:\n   - `price_reduction = 30`\n   - `advertising_boost = 20`\n\n6. Let's calculate the effect of each parameter:\n   - Price reduction contribution: 30 * 10 = 300\n   - Advertising boost contribution: 20 * 15 = 300\n\n7. The total increase in sales would be: 300 (from price reduction) + 300 (from advertising boost) = 600\n\n8. Therefore, the final sales would be: 100 (initial sales) + 600 (total increase) = 700\n\n9. To determine if the observed increase in final_sales is due to the advertising boost, we need to consider that both the price reduction and the advertising boost contributed equally to the increase.\n\n10. Since both factors contributed equally and we cannot isolate the effect of just one factor without additional information, we cannot conclusively attribute the entire observed increase to the advertising boost alone.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `increase_sales` takes two parameters: `price_reduction` and `advertising_boost`.\n\n2.

Total sales calculation:\n   - 100 (initial) + 300 (price reduction) + 300 (advertising boost) = 700\n\n8.

If `price_reduction` is greater than 0, it adds `price_reduction * 10` to the current `sales` value.\n   - In this case, `price_reduction` is 30, so `30 * 10 = 300` would be added to `sales`.\n\n4.
