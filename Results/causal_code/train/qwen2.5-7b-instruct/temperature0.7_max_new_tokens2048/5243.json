    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` checks if the key 'age' exists in the input dictionary.\n2.

Based on these conditions, it sets the 'tax_bracket' key.\n\nGiven that we are only asked about the setting of 'is_adult' when 'age' is set to 25, we can focus on the first part of the logic.\n\n- Since the 'age' is set to 25, which is greater than or equal to 18, the condition `data['age'] >= 18` will evaluate to `True`.\n- Therefore, 'is_adult' will be set to `True`.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
