    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `simulateDay` method takes an integer `seed` as input.\n2. If `seed % 5 == 0`, then `isRainy` is set to true.\n3. If `seed % 5 != 0`, then `isRainy` is set to false.\n4. If `isRainy` is false, the temperature is set to 25 degrees.\n5. We need to determine what happens when the seed is not a multiple of 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition where the seed is not a multiple of 5:\n- If `seed % 5 != 0`, then the expression `if (seed % 5 == 0)` evaluates to false.\n- As a result, `isRainy` will be set to false.\n- When `isRainy` is false, the temperature is set to 25 degrees.\n\nTherefore, if we modify the seed value to make it a non-multiple of 5, the temperature will indeed be 25 degrees.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
