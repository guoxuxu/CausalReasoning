    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `check_login` checks if the provided password matches the stored password for a given user.\n\n2. If the password is correct, the function sets `user['is_locked']` to `False` and returns `True`.\n\n3. If the password is incorrect, the function increments `failed_attempts` by 1.\n\n4. If `failed_attempts` reaches 3 or more, the function sets `user['is_locked']` to `True`.\n\n5. The function always returns `False` when the password is incorrect.\n\n6. For an account to be considered \"locked,\" `user['is_locked']` must be set to `True`.\n\n7. Based on the logic, `user['is_locked']` will only be set to `True` if there have been at least 3 failed login attempts.\n\nGiven these points, if a user's account is observed to be locked, it indeed means that there were at least three failed login attempts.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the logic of the `check_login` function:\n\n1. The function takes three parameters: `user`, `password`, and `failed_attempts`.\n2. It checks if the provided `password` matches the one stored in the `user` dictionary.\n3. If the password is correct:\n   - It sets `user['is_locked']` to `False`.\n   - It returns `True`.\n4. If the password is incorrect:\n   - It increments `failed_attempts` by 1.\n   - If `failed_attempts` reaches 3 or more, it sets `user['is_locked']` to `True`.\n   - It returns `False`.\n\nNow, let's consider the condition under which an account would be locked:\n\n- An account is locked (`user['is_locked'] = True`) only when there have been 3 or more failed login attempts.\n\nTherefore, if an account is observed to be locked, we can indeed assume that there were at least three failed login attempts.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

In both cases (whether the password is correct or incorrect), the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the login was successful.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where an account is observed to be locked:\n\n- For the account to be locked (`user['is_locked'] = True`), the `failed_attempts` must have reached 3 or more.\n- This means that there were at least three failed login attempts before the account got locked.\n\nTherefore, if a user's account is observed to be locked, we can indeed assume that there were at least three failed login attempts.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
