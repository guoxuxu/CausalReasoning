    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The formula for calculating profit is:\n   \\[ \\text{Profit} = \\text{Sales} - \\text{Costs} \\]\n\n2. The formula for calculating ROI (Return on Investment) is:\n   \\[ \\text{ROI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Marketing Expense}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n3. Substituting the profit formula into the ROI formula gives:\n   \\[ \\text{ROI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Sales} - \\text{Costs}}{\\text{Marketing Expense}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\n4. Now, let's consider what happens when 'Sales' increases while 'Costs' and 'Marketing Expense' remain constant:\n   - The numerator (\\(\\text{Sales} - \\text{Costs}\\)) will increase because 'Sales' is increasing.\n   - The denominator (\\(\\text{Marketing Expense}\\)) remains unchanged.\n\n5. Since the numerator is increasing while the denominator stays the same, the overall value of the fraction will increase. Multiplying this fraction by 100 will also result in an increase.\n\nTherefore, if 'Sales' increases while 'Costs' and 'Marketing Expense' remain constant, 'ROI' will indeed increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The formula for ROI (Return on Investment) is given as:\n   ROI = (profit / marketing_expense) * 100\n\n2. We know that profit is calculated as:\n   profit = sales - costs\n\n3. In the question, we're told that 'sales' increases while 'costs' and 'marketing_expense' remain constant.\n\n4. Let's consider two scenarios:\n   - Scenario A: Initial sales, costs, and marketing_expense\n   - Scenario B: Increased sales, with costs and marketing_expense unchanged\n\n5. In Scenario A:\n   - Let initial sales be S1\n   - Costs are C\n   - Marketing expense is M\n   - Initial profit = P1 = S1 - C\n   - Initial ROI = R1 = (P1 / M) * 100\n\n6. In Scenario B:\n   - New sales (increased) = S2 > S1\n   - Costs are still C\n   - Marketing expense is still M\n   - New profit = P2 = S2 - C\n   - New ROI = R2 = (P2 / M) * 100\n\n7. Since S2 > S1, it follows that P2 > P1 (because costs are constant).\n\n8. As P2 > P1, when we divide both by the same constant M (marketing expense), the result (R2) will also be greater than R1.\n\nTherefore, if 'sales' increases while keeping 'costs' and 'marketing_expense' constant, 'ROI' will indeed increase.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We have the function `calculate_performance(sales, costs, marketing_expense)` which calculates `profit` and then `ROI`.\n   - The formula for `profit` is `sales - costs`.\n   - The formula for `ROI` is `(profit / marketing_expense) * 100`.\n\n2. **Understanding the Relationships**:\n   - `sales` directly affects `profit`: as `sales` increases, `profit` increases (assuming `costs` remain constant).\n   - `profit` directly affects `ROI`: as `profit` increases, `ROI` increases (assuming `marketing_expense` remains constant).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Impact of Increasing Sales**:\n   - If `sales` increases while `costs` and `marketing_expense` remain constant:\n     - The new `profit` will be higher because `profit = sales - costs` and `sales` has increased.\n     - Since `ROI = (profit / marketing_expense) * 100`, and both the numerator (`profit`) and the denominator (`marketing_expense`) remain constant, an increase in `profit` will lead to an increase in `ROI`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, if `sales` increases while `costs` and `marketing_expense` remain constant, `ROI` will indeed increase.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1.

If `sales` increases while `costs` and `marketing_expense` remain constant:\n   - `profit` will increase because it is calculated as `sales - costs`.\n   - The increase in `profit` will be proportionally larger than any change in `marketing_expense` since `marketing_expense` is held constant.\n   - As a result, the value of the fraction \\(\\frac{\\text{profit}}{\\text{marketing\\_expense}}\\) will increase.\n   - Multiplying this increased fraction by 100 will also result in an increase in `ROI`.\n\nTherefore, if `sales` increases while keeping `costs` and `marketing_expense` constant, `ROI` will indeed increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
