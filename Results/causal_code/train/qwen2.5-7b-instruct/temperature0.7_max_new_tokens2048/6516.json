    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `simulateRain` method checks two conditions:\n   - `humidityHigh`\n   - `cloudsFormed`\n\n2.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given code simulates rain based on two conditions:\n   - `humidityHigh` (high humidity)\n   - `cloudsFormed` (clouds formed)\n\n2.
