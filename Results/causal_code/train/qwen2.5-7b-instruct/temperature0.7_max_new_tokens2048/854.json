    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with a `WeatherSimulator` object initialized with an initial temperature of 5 degrees.\n2. The `increase_temperature` method is called with an increment of 25 degrees.\n3. Inside the method, the current temperature (5) is increased by the increment (25), resulting in a new temperature of 30 degrees.\n4. The condition checks are then evaluated:\n   - Since 30 is greater than 30, the method returns 'sunny'.\n\nGiven these steps, if the initial temperature is set to 5 degrees and the increment is 25 degrees, the resulting weather will indeed be 'sunny'.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
