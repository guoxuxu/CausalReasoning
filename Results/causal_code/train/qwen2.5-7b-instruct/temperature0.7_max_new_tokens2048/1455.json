    "Let's break down the function `process_data` to understand how it categorizes the risk based on age:\n\n1. The function checks if the key 'age' exists in the input dictionary `data`.\n2. If 'age' is found:\n   - It then checks if the value of 'age' is greater than 50.\n   - If true, it sets `data['risk']` to 'high'.\n   - If false, it sets `data['risk']` to 'low'.\n3. If 'age' is not found in the dictionary, it sets `data['risk']` to 'unknown'.\n\nNow, addressing the question: \"If a person's age is over 50, will the risk automatically be categorized as 'high'?\"\n\nBased on the function logic, if the 'age' key exists in the input dictionary and its value is greater than 50, then the risk will indeed be categorized as 'high'. However, if the 'age' key does not exist in the input dictionary, the function will set the risk to 'unknown'.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

If 'age' is not found in the `data` dictionary:\n   - It sets `data['risk']` to 'unknown'.\n\nGiven these steps, we can see that if a person's age is over 50, the `data['risk']` will indeed be set to 'high'.

If 'age' does not exist in the dictionary, it sets `data['risk']` to 'unknown'.\n\nGiven this logic, if a person's age is over 50, the risk will indeed be categorized as 'high', provided that the 'age' key exists in the dictionary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
