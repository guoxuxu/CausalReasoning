    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `apply_discount` method reduces the amount of each completed sale by 10%.\n\n2. For each completed sale, the new amount becomes:\n   original_amount * (1 - 0.10) = original_amount * 0.90\n\n3. This means that each completed sale's amount is reduced to 90% of its original value.\n\n4. The average sale amount is calculated as:\n   sum(completed_sales) / len(completed_sales)\n\n5. If we apply a 10% discount to all completed sales, each term in the numerator (sum(completed_sales)) will be multiplied by 0.90.\n\n6. Therefore, the new sum of completed sales will be 0.90 times the original sum.\n\n7. Since the denominator (len(completed_sales)) remains unchanged, the new average sale amount will be:\n   (0.90 * original_sum) / len(completed_sales) = 0.90 * (original_sum / len(completed_sales))\n\n8. This shows that the new average sale amount is 90% of the original average sale amount.\n\nGiven this reasoning, applying a 10% discount will indeed decrease the average sale amount.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Current Average Calculation**: The `average_sale_amount` method calculates the average of all completed sales amounts.\n\n2. **Discount Application**: The `apply_discount` method applies a percentage discount to each completed sale. If we apply a 10% discount, each completed sale amount will be reduced by 10%.\n\n3. **Effect on Completed Sales Amounts**: For each completed sale, the new amount after applying the discount will be 90% of its original value (i.e., `record['amount'] * (1 - 0.10)`).\n\n4. **Impact on Average**: Since every completed sale amount is reduced by the same percentage (10%), the overall sum of these amounts will also be reduced by 10%. As a result, the average of these amounts will also decrease by 10%.\n\nTherefore, applying a 10% discount to all completed sales will indeed decrease the average sale amount.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "To determine whether the average sale amount will decrease after applying a 10% discount, let's reason through the process step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - The `average_sale_amount` method calculates the average of all `amount` values where the `status` is 'completed'.\n   - This calculation is based on the original `amount` values before any discounts are applied.\n\n2. **Discount Application**:\n   - The `apply_discount` method applies a 10% discount to each completed sale.\n   - The new amount for each completed sale is calculated as `record['amount'] * (1 - discount_percentage / 100)`.\n\n3. **Impact on Average Sale Amount**:\n   - Since the discount is applied to the `amount` field of each completed sale, the new `amount` value for each completed sale will be lower than the original value.\n   - Therefore, the sum of the amounts for all completed sales will decrease.\n   - As the number of completed sales remains the same, the average of these reduced amounts will also decrease.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that applying a 10% discount will indeed result in a decrease in the average sale amount.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The `apply_discount` method applies a specified percentage discount to all completed sales records.\n\n2.

This means that the amount of each completed sale is reduced by the discount percentage.\n\n4. The `average_sale_amount` method calculates the average of the amounts in the completed sales records.\n\n5. Since the `apply_discount` method reduces the amount of each completed sale, the values used to calculate the average will be smaller than before the discount was applied.\n\n6. Averaging a set of numbers that have been reduced will result in a smaller average value compared to the original average.\n\nTherefore, applying a 10% discount will indeed decrease the average sale amount.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
