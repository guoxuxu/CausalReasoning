  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Applying a heat wave adds 5 to the `forecastTemp`. If the original `forecastTemp` was set at 10 (under 15 degrees initial temp), adding 5 results in 15; while if it starts at 25 (at least 15 degrees or higher initial temp), it increases to 30. Both scenarios post-heat wave yield a temperature that is still above 20, which indicates it will not be considered 'cold' under the `isCold` condition.",
  "causal_map": "forecastTemp < 15 → forecastTemp = 10; forecastTemp ≥ 15 → forecastTemp = 25; forecastTemp → forecastTemp += 5; forecastTemp → isCold",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Temperature Assignment**:\n   - The constructor of `WeatherManager` sets the `forecastTemp` based on the `currentTemp`.\n   - If `currentTemp` is less than 15, `forecastTemp` is set to 10.\n   - Otherwise, `forecastTemp` is set to 25.\n\n2. **Applying Heat Wave**:\n   - The `applyHeatWave` method increments `forecastTemp` by 5.\n\n3. **Final Temperature Calculation**:\n   - If `currentTemp` is less than 15, after applying the heat wave:\n     - `forecastTemp` would be 10 + 5 = 15.\n   - If `currentTemp` is 15 or more, after applying the heat wave:\n     - `forecastTemp` would be 25 + 5 = 30.\n\n4. **Checking the Condition**:\n   - We need to check if the forecast temperature will necessarily be above 20 after applying the heat wave.\n   - From the calculations above, we see that even in the worst-case scenario (initial `forecastTemp` being 15), after applying the heat wave, the temperature becomes 20.\n\nGiven these steps, the forecast temperature will not necessarily be above 20; it can be exactly 20 after applying the heat wave when the initial `forecastTemp` is 15.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the logic step by step:\n\n1. The `WeatherManager` class has an initial forecastTemp set based on the currentTemp passed to its constructor:\n   - If `currentTemp < 15`, `forecastTemp` is set to 10.\n   - Otherwise, `forecastTemp` is set to 25.\n\n2. The `applyHeatWave()` method increases `forecastTemp` by 5.\n\n3. We need to determine if applying a heat wave will always result in `forecastTemp` being above 20.\n\nLet's consider the two scenarios for the initial `forecastTemp`:\n\n- **Scenario 1: Initial `forecastTemp` is 10**\n  - Applying a heat wave: `forecastTemp += 5` → `forecastTemp` becomes 15.\n  - 15 is not above 20.\n\n- **Scenario 2: Initial `forecastTemp` is 25**\n  - Applying a heat wave: `forecastTemp += 5` → `forecastTemp` becomes 30.\n  - 30 is above 20.\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that applying a heat wave does not necessarily result in `forecastTemp` being above 20. It can stay at 15 if the initial `forecastTemp` was 10.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

The applyHeatWave method increases forecastTemp by 5.\n\n3. We need to determine if forecastTemp will necessarily be above 20 after applying a heat wave.\n\n4. Let's consider both cases for the initial forecastTemp:\n\n   Case 1: Initial forecastTemp is 10 (currentTemp < 15)\n   - After applying a heat wave, forecastTemp becomes 10 + 5 = 15\n   - 15 is not above 20, so in this case, it does not necessarily become above 20.\n\n   Case 2: Initial forecastTemp is 25 (currentTemp >= 15)\n   - After applying a heat wave, forecastTemp becomes 25 + 5 = 30\n   - 30 is above 20, so in this case, it does become above 20.\n\n5. From the above analysis, we can see that while the forecastTemp will definitely increase by 5 when a heat wave is applied, it does not necessarily become above 20 because it depends on the initial value of forecastTemp.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
