    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `adjust_temperature` method is called with a target temperature that is higher than the current temperature (25 vs 20).\n\n2. In the method, it checks if the difference between the target temperature and the current temperature (`diff`) is greater than 0.\n\n3. Since the target temperature (25) is indeed higher than the current temperature (20), `diff` will be positive.\n\n4. When `diff` is positive, the code sets `heater_on` to True and `cooler_on` to False.\n\n5. It then enters a loop where it increments the temperature until it reaches the target temperature.\n\n6. Throughout this process, `cooler_on` remains False because the loop only runs when the current temperature is less than the target temperature, which means the heater is on.\n\nTherefore, if the target temperature is set higher than the current temperature, the cooler will not be turned on.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

In the method, we first calculate the difference between the target temperature and the current temperature:\n   - diff = target_temp - self.temperature\n   - diff = 25 - 20 = 5\n\n3. Since the difference is positive (diff > 0), the method enters the block that handles increasing the temperature:\n   - self.heater_on = True\n   - self.cooler_on = False\n\n4. A loop is then started to increase the temperature until it reaches or exceeds the target temperature:\n   - while self.temperature < target_temp:\n     - self.temperature += 1\n\n5. This loop will run until the temperature reaches 25, turning off the heater when the condition is no longer met.\n\n6.

    "Let's break down the logic of the `adjust_temperature` method:\n\n1. The method takes a `target_temp` as an argument.\n2. It calculates the difference between `target_temp` and the current temperature (`diff`).\n3. If `diff` is positive (i.e., `target_temp` is higher than the current temperature):\n   - The heater is turned on (`heater_on = True`).\n   - The cooler is turned off (`cooler_on = False`).\n   - A loop runs to increase the temperature until it reaches or exceeds the `target_temp`.\n4.
