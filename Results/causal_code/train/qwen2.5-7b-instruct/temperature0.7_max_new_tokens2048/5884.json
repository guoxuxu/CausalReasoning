    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `calculate_costs` calculates the total cost based on quantity, base cost, and transport cost.\n\n2. The total cost is initially calculated as `(quantity * base_cost) + transport_cost`.\n\n3. If `quantity > 50`, a 10% discount is applied to the total cost:\n   - `discount = 0.1`\n   - `total_cost = total_cost - (total_cost * discount)`\n\n4. The question asks if 'total_cost' reducing implies that 'quantity' was above 50.\n\n5. We need to consider two scenarios:\n   - Scenario A: `quantity <= 50`\n     - In this case, no discount is applied, so 'total_cost' would not change.\n   - Scenario B: `quantity > 50`\n     - Here, a 10% discount is applied, which would reduce 'total_cost'.\n\n6. From these scenarios, we can see that 'total_cost' only reduces when `quantity > 50`.\n\n7. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. 'total_cost' could be reduced due to other factors (e.g., different values for `base_cost` or `transport_cost`), not just because `quantity > 50`.\n\n8. Therefore, while a reduction in 'total_cost' often indicates that `quantity > 50`, it is not a definitive indicator.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The reduction in 'total_cost' could be due to other factors as well, such as changes in base cost or transport cost.\n4. We need to determine if the reduction in 'total_cost' always implies that 'quantity' was above 50.\n\nNow, let's consider scenarios:\n- If quantity > 50, then there is a potential for a discount, which would reduce the total cost.\n- However, if the base cost or transport cost is reduced, the total cost can also decrease without the quantity being above 50.\n\nGiven these points, we cannot definitively say that a reduction in 'total_cost' always implies that 'quantity' was above 50.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

The reduction in `total_cost` only happens when the quantity is greater than 50 because of the discount logic.\n\n5. Therefore, if `total_cost` does reduce, it must be due to the application of the 10% discount, which only occurs when the quantity is greater than 50.\n\n6.
