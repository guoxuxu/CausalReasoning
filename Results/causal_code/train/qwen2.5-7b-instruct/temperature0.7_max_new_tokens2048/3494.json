    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The initial temperature in the RoomController class is set to 20.\n\n2. The increaseTemp() method does two things:\n   - Sets heaterOn to true\n   - Increases the temperature by 5\n\n3. If we call increaseTemp(), the temperature will be increased by 5 from its current value.\n\n4. Since the initial temperature is 20, after calling increaseTemp(), the new temperature will be:\n   20 + 5 = 25\n\n5. However, the question asks if the temperature will always be greater than 20 after calling increaseTemp().\n\n6. While in this specific case (starting at 20), the temperature would indeed be 25 which is greater than 20, there's no guarantee that the initial temperature will always be 20.\n\n7. If the temperature was already above 20 before calling increaseTemp(), the new temperature could still be above 20 but not necessarily greater by 5.\n\n8. For example, if the temperature was 23 before calling increaseTemp(), it would become 28 after the method call, which is still greater than 20.\n\n9. But if the temperature was 24 before calling increaseTemp(), it would become 29, which is also greater than 20.\n\n10. The key point is that the method increases the temperature by 5, but doesn't ensure it will always be greater than 20 if the starting temperature isn't specified as 20.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

We need to consider if the temperature will always be greater than 20 after calling increaseTemp():\n\n4. If we call increaseTemp(), it will:\n   - Set heaterOn to true (this doesn't affect the temperature directly)\n   - Increase the temperature by 5\n\n5. Since the initial temperature is 20, increasing it by 5 results in a new temperature of 25.\n\n6. However, we must also consider that the temperature can drop below 20 if other methods are called between calls to increaseTemp(). The decreaseTemp() method could potentially lower the temperature back down to 20 or below.\n\n7. Therefore, while the temperature will be 25 immediately after calling increaseTemp(), there's no guarantee that it will remain above 20 if other methods are called afterward.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

After calling increaseTemp(), the new temperature will be:\n   - Initial temperature (20) + 5 = 25\n\n5. Since the increase is fixed at 5 and the initial temperature is 20, the temperature will indeed be greater than 20 after calling increaseTemp().\n\n6.

We need to consider if the temperature can ever be less than or equal to 20 after calling increaseTemp().\n\n4. When increaseTemp() is called:\n   - The temperature becomes 20 + 5 = 25 (assuming it was 20 initially)\n\n5. Even if we were to call decreaseTemp() immediately after increaseTemp():\n   - The temperature would still be at least 25 - 3 = 22 (since decreaseTemp() only reduces the temperature by 3 when heaterOn is true)\n\n6.
