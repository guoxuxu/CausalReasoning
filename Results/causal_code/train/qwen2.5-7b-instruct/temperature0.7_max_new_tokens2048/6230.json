    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data` checks if the key 'temp' exists in the input data.\n2. If 'temp' exists, it converts the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the `fahrenheit_to_celsius` function.\n3. If 'temp' does not exist, it assigns `None` to `temp_f`.\n4. The function then evaluates `temp_f`:\n   - If `temp_f` is truthy (i.e., not `None`) and greater than 20, it returns 'hot'.\n   - If `temp_f` is truthy and less than or equal to 20, it returns 'cold'.\n   - If `temp_f` is `None`, it returns 'no temperature data'.\n\nThe critical point here is that 'no temperature data' is returned when `temp_f` is `None`.
