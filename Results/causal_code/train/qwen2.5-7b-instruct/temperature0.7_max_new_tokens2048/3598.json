    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The formula for BMI is: \\( \\text{BMI} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{height}^2} \\)\n\n2. When the weight increases while the height remains constant, we need to consider how this change affects the overall value of the BMI.\n\n3. Let's denote the original weight as \\( W_1 \\), the new weight as \\( W_2 \\), and the height as \\( H \\).\n\n4. Original BMI (\\( \\text{BMI}_1 \\)) = \\( \\frac{W_1}{H^2} \\)\n\n5. New BMI (\\( \\text{BMI}_2 \\)) = \\( \\frac{W_2}{H^2} \\)\n\n6. Since \\( W_2 > W_1 \\) and \\( H^2 \\) remains constant, it follows that \\( \\frac{W_2}{H^2} > \\frac{W_1}{H^2} \\).\n\n7.

If we increase the weight while keeping the height constant, the numerator of the fraction will increase.\n\n3.

When the weight increases:\n   - The numerator (weight) in the formula becomes larger.\n   - The denominator (height squared) remains unchanged as height is not changing.\n\n3.

An increase in BMI due to increased weight will necessarily cause a change in the BMI category, unless the weight increase is exactly enough to keep the BMI within the same category range.\n\nTherefore, if the weight increases and the height remains unchanged, the BMI will indeed increase, and as a consequence, the BMI category may also change.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
