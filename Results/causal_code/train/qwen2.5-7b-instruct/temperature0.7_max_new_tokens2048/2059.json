    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Base Price and Tax Rate**: The base price of the product is set to 100, and the tax rate is set to 20% (0.2).\n\n2. **Discount Application**:\n   - When a discount is applied, the formula used is: \n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_price} = (\\text{base\\_price} - \\text{discount}) \\times (1 + \\text{tax\\_rate})\n     \\]\n   - Without a discount, the formula would simply be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{final\\_price} = \\text{base\\_price} \\times (1 + \\text{tax\\_rate})\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - Let's compare the two scenarios:\n     - With a discount of 10:\n       \\[\n       \\text{final\\_price\\_with\\_discount} = (100 - 10) \\times (1 + 0.2) = 90 \\times 1.2 = 108\n       \\]\n     - Without any discount:\n       \\[\n       \\text{final\\_price\\_without\\_discount} = 100 \\times (1 + 0.2) = 100 \\times 1.2 = 120\n       \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - In both cases, we can see that applying a discount results in a lower final price compared to not applying any discount.\n\nTherefore, if a discount is applied, the final price will always be lower compared to when no discount is applied, assuming the base price and tax rate remain constant.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a `ProductSales` class with an `__init__` method that initializes the base price and tax rate. The `calculate_final_price` method calculates the final price after applying a discount.\n\n2. **Final Price Calculation**:\n   - The formula used is: `final_price = (base_price - discount) * (1 + tax_rate)`\n   - This means the final price is calculated based on the discounted price and then adding the tax.\n\n3. **Discount Application**:\n   - When a discount is applied, the `base_price - discount` part of the formula decreases.\n   - Since the tax rate is constant, multiplying by `(1 + tax_rate)` still applies the same tax rate to a smaller base price.\n\n4. **Comparison Without Discount**:\n   - If no discount is applied, the formula becomes: `final_price = base_price * (1 + tax_rate)`\n   - Comparing the two formulas:\n     - With discount: \\( (base_price - discount) \\times (1 + tax_rate) \\)\n     - Without discount: \\( base_price \\times (1 + tax_rate) \\)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \\( base_price - discount < base_price \\), and we are multiplying both sides by the same positive factor \\( (1 + tax_rate) \\), the final price with a discount will always be less than the final price without a discount, assuming all other factors remain constant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Since the discount is subtracted from the base price, the value inside the parentheses will be less than the base price.\n6. Multiplying a smaller number by \\(1 + \\text{tax\\_rate}\\) (which is greater than 1) will result in a smaller final price compared to multiplying the full base price by \\(1 + \\text{tax\\_rate}\\).\n\nTherefore, applying a discount will always result in a lower final price compared to when no discount is applied, assuming the base price and tax rate remain constant.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

To determine if the final price is always lower with a discount, we can compare these two expressions:\n   - Without discount: \\( P_0 = \\text{base\\_price} \\times (1 + \\text{tax\\_rate}) \\)\n   - With discount: \\( P_d = (\\text{base\\_price} - \\text{discount}) \\times (1 + \\text{tax\\_rate}) \\)\n\n6.
