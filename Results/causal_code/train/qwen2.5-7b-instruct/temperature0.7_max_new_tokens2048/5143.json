  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The code increases the 'adjusted_temp' by 1.5 times the 'adjustment' in desert locations. However, even if the 'adjustment' is zero, the 'adjusted_temp' will equal 'base_temp', which does not necessarily mean it's higher; 'base_temp' itself can vary. The question's phrasing might suggest that in desert, inherently, temperatures could be higher, but this solely depends on 'base_temp' from the 'weather_api', not due to the multiplication factor in the code.",
  "causal_map": "location → adjusted_temp; adjustment → adjusted_temp",
  "causal_map_integration": "In a desert location, 'adjusted_temp' will be 1.5 times 'adjustment' higher than 'base_temp'; otherwise, it will be exactly 'adjustment' higher. Thus, even with an 'adjustment' of zero, 'adjusted_temp' in a desert can still be higher due to the multiplier.",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `update_temperature` takes three parameters: `location`, `date`, and `adjustment`.\n\n2.

If the `location` is 'desert':\n   - It adjusts the base temperature by adding `adjustment * 1.5` to the base temperature.\n   \n5. Otherwise (if the `location` is not 'desert'):\n   - It adjusts the base temperature by adding `adjustment` to the base temperature.\n\n6. The key part of the question is whether `adjusted_temp` can be higher even if `adjustment` is zero when the `location` is 'desert'.\n\n7. If `adjustment` is zero:\n   - For a non-desert location, `adjusted_temp` would simply be equal to `base_temp` because `adjustment` is added to `base_temp`.\n   - For a desert location, `adjusted_temp` would be `base_temp + (0 * 1.5)`, which simplifies to `base_temp`.\n\n8.
