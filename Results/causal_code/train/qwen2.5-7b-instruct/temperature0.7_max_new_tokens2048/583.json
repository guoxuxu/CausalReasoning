    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with the initial values:\n   - `windSpeed = 10`\n   - `airPressure = 100`\n   - `isRaining = false`\n\n2. The `updateWeather` method is called with new values:\n   - `newWindSpeed = 16`\n   - `newAirPressure = 92`\n\n3. Inside the `updateWeather` method, the values are updated:\n   - `windSpeed` is set to `16`\n   - `airPressure` is set to `92`\n\n4. The condition for rain is checked:\n   - `if (windSpeed > 15 && airPressure < 95)`\n   - Substituting the new values: `(16 > 15 && 92 < 95)`\n\n5.
