    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The original formula for ROI is:\n   \\[ ROI = \\left(\\frac{profit}{marketing\\_expense}\\right) * 100 \\]\n\n2. When the intervention sets `marketing_expense` to zero, we substitute \\( marketing\\_expense = 0 \\) into the formula:\n   \\[ ROI = \\left(\\frac{profit}{0}\\right) * 100 \\]\n\n3. Division by zero is undefined in mathematics. This means that mathematically, setting `marketing_expense` to zero will result in an undefined value for ROI.\n\n4. In practical terms, if the marketing expense is set to zero, it would mean no marketing activity, which could theoretically lead to no additional sales or profit from that source. However, the calculation itself becomes invalid due to the division by zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThe ROI cannot be calculated when `marketing_expense` is zero because of the mathematical operation involved.",
    "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The formula for ROI is given as:\n   \\[ ROI = \\left( \\frac{profit}{marketing\\_expense} \\right) * 100 \\]\n\n2. If we set 'marketing_expense' to zero, we need to consider what happens mathematically when we divide by zero.\n\n3. Division by zero is undefined in mathematics. This means that if 'marketing_expense' is set to zero, the expression \\(\\frac{profit}{marketing\\_expense}\\) becomes undefined.\n\n4. Since ROI is calculated as \\(\\left( \\frac{profit}{marketing\\_expense} \\right) * 100\\), setting 'marketing_expense' to zero would make the entire ROI calculation undefined.\n\n5. In practical terms, this would indicate an error or an impossible scenario in the business context, likely suggesting that the marketing expense cannot be zero for meaningful ROI calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

If we set 'marketing_expense' to zero, the formula becomes:\n   ROI = (profit / 0) * 100\n\n3. Division by zero is undefined in mathematics. This means that mathematically, the result cannot be calculated.\n\n4. In most programming languages, attempting to divide by zero would result in an error or exception being thrown.\n\n5. Therefore, if 'marketing_expense' is set to zero while keeping 'sales' and 'costs' unchanged, the ROI calculation would not yield a valid number.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n\nThe ROI would not be calculable or would result in an undefined value, rather than maintaining its original value.",
