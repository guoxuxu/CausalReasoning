    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `TrafficSystem` class is initialized with no cars and green traffic lights.\n\n2. **Adding Cars**:\n   - Each time `add_car()` is called, one car is added to the system.\n   - If the number of cars exceeds 10, the traffic light is set to red using `set_traffic_light('Red')`.\n\n3. **Setting Traffic Light to Red**:\n   - When the traffic light is set to red, it checks if there are fewer than 5 cars.\n   - If there are fewer than 5 cars, it subtracts 2 from the number of cars (but this doesn't affect the question about whether the lights turn red).\n\n4. **Removing Cars**:\n   - The `remove_car()` method reduces the number of cars by one if there are any cars present.\n   - If the number of cars is 10 or less, the traffic light is set back to green using `set_traffic_light('Green')`.\n\nGiven these rules, let's consider what happens when we keep adding cars:\n\n- As long as the number of cars is less than or equal to 10, the traffic light will stay green.\n- Once the number of cars exceeds 10, the traffic light will turn red.\n\nTherefore, adding more cars eventually causes the traffic lights to turn red when the number of cars reaches or exceeds 11.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficSystem` class has an attribute `number_of_cars` which starts at 0.\n2. When a car is added using the `add_car` method, it increments `number_of_cars` by 1.\n3. If `number_of_cars` exceeds 10, the `set_traffic_light` method is called with 'Red' as the argument.\n4. In the `set_traffic_light` method:\n   - It changes the traffic light to the specified color.\n   - If the new color is 'Red' and `number_of_cars` is less than 5, it decreases `number_of_cars` by 2.\n\nNow, let's consider what happens when we keep adding cars:\n\n- Initially, `number_of_cars` is 0.\n- Adding one car will increment `number_of_cars` to 1.\n- Adding another car will bring `number_of_cars` to 2, and so on.\n- Once `number_of_cars` reaches 10, the `set_traffic_light` method will be called with 'Red'.\n- At this point, the traffic lights turn red, and `number_of_cars` will remain at 10 (since adding another car would still trigger the same condition).\n\nTherefore, adding more cars beyond the initial 10 will not change the state of the traffic lights because the condition for turning them red (having more than 10 cars) is already met.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```\n\nAdding more cars eventually causes the traffic lights to turn red once the count reaches 10.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficSystem` class has an attribute `number_of_cars` which starts at 0.\n2. When we call `add_car()`, it increments `number_of_cars` by 1.\n3. If `number_of_cars` becomes greater than 10, the `set_traffic_light('Red')` method is called.\n4. In the `set_traffic_light` method, if the light is set to 'Red' and there are fewer than 5 cars, it will decrement `number_of_cars` by 2.\n\nGiven these rules, let's consider what happens as we keep adding cars:\n\n- Adding 11 cars will trigger the first condition in `set_traffic_light`, turning the light to 'Red'.\n- Once the light is 'Red', even if we remove cars, as long as there are fewer than 5 cars, the `set_traffic_light` method will decrement `number_of_cars` by 2 each time `remove_car()` is called until `number_of_cars` reaches 0.\n\nTherefore, once the light turns red due to having more than 10 cars, it can stay red unless the number of cars drops below 5, at which point it will start decrementing. However, the question specifically asks if adding more cars eventually causes the traffic lights to turn red.\n\nThe answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"} because adding more than 10 cars will eventually cause the traffic lights to turn red.",

It only happens if `number_of_cars` is 10 or less after a car is removed.\n\nTherefore, once the traffic lights turn red due to reaching 10 cars, they will stay red unless the number of cars drops below 5, at which point `number_of_cars` would be reduced by 2 (to 3), but the lights will still be 'Red'.\n\nBased on this analysis, adding more cars eventually causes the traffic lights to turn red, and they do not automatically turn green just because the number of cars is reduced.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

This changes `traffic_lights` to 'Red'.\n\n4. **Red Light Behavior**: When `traffic_lights` are 'Red', there is a special condition where if `number_of_cars` is less than 5, it decrements `number_of_cars` by 2. However, this only happens when the light is already red and the car count is low, not as a direct result of adding more cars.\n\n5. **Removing Cars**: `remove_car()` decreases `number_of_cars` by 1 and if `number_of_cars` is 10 or fewer, it sets `traffic_lights` back to 'Green'. This does not directly affect the turning on of the red light based on the car count exceeding 10.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The primary condition for the traffic lights to turn red is that `number_of_cars` must exceed 10.
