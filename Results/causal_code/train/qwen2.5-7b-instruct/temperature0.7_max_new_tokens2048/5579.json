  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The function process_data calculates 'w' as 2 times 'x'. Any increase in 'x' directly causes a corresponding increase in 'w', and since 'z' is the sum of 'w' and 'y' (where 'y' remains constant), 'z' will also increase. Thus, the 'result' returned by the function increases with an increase in 'x'.",
  "causal_map": "x → z; y → z",
  "causal_map_integration": "Increasing x will increase z, and increasing y will increase z. Therefore, increasing x will definitely increase the result, and increasing y will also increase the result.",

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `process_data(x, y)` takes two inputs, `x` and `y`.\n2. Inside the function:\n   - `w = x * 2`: This line doubles the value of `x`.\n   - `z = w + y`: This line adds `y` to `w`, which is effectively `2 * x + y`.\n3. The function returns `z`.\n\nNow, let's consider how increasing `x` affects the result:\n\n- If `x` increases, then `w` (which is `2 * x`) will also increase.\n- Since `z` is calculated as `w + y`, and `y` remains unchanged, an increase in `w` will directly lead to an increase in `z`.\n\nTherefore, if `x` is increased, `z` will definitely increase because `z` is directly dependent on `x` through the variable `w`.\n\nThe answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
