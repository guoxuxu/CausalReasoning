    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `handle_request` function takes `user_data` as an argument.\n2. It checks if `'authenticated'` is present in `user_data` with a default value of `False`.\n3. If `'authenticated'` is `True`, it proceeds to call `process_data(user_data)`.\n4. `process_data` function increments the `'age'` key by 1 if `'age'` exists in `data`.\n5. Regardless of whether `'age'` exists or not, `process_data` returns the modified `data`.\n6. `handle_request` then returns a dictionary with `'status'` and `'data'`.\n\nGiven this logic, for the response status to be `'processed'`, the condition `if user_data.get('authenticated', False):` must evaluate to `True`. This means that `user_data['authenticated']` must be `True` when the function is called.\n\nTherefore, if the final response status is `'processed'`, it does indeed indicate that the `'authenticated'` key was initially set to `True`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The `handle_request` function then returns a dictionary with two keys: `'status'` and `'data'`.\n\n5.
