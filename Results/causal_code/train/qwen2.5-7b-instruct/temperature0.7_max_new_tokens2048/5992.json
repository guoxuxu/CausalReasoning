    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Normalization Process**:\n   - The `process_data` function first normalizes the input data using the formula: \\( \\text{normalized\\_data} = \\frac{\\text{data} - \\text{data.mean()}}{\\text{data.std()}} \\).\n   - This transformation centers the data around zero with a standard deviation of 1.\n\n2. **Threshold Calculation**:\n   - The threshold is set to the mean of the normalized data.\n   - Since the normalization process centers the data around zero, the mean of the normalized data will be close to zero (ideally, it should be exactly zero if the data is perfectly normally distributed).\n\n3. **Result Generation**:\n   - For each value in the normalized data, if the value is greater than the threshold (which is close to zero), the result is `True`.\n   - Otherwise, the result is `False`.\n\n4. **Interpreting the Results**:\n   - If more values in the `results` list are `True`, it means that more normalized values are above the threshold (close to zero).\n   - This implies that more original data points were above their mean before normalization.\n\n5. **Original Data Mean Consideration**:\n   - The normalization process does not change the relative positions of the data points with respect to their mean.\n   - If more values in the `results` list are `True`, it indicates that more original data points were above their mean.\n\nTherefore, if more values in the `results` list are `True`, it does indeed infer that the original data had a higher mean.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
