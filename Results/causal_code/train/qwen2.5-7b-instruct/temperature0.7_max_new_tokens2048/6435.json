    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `process_data` function takes a list of numbers (`data_list`) as input.\n2. It calculates the total sum of these numbers using `sum(data_list)`.\n3. It then divides this total by the length of the list to get the average.\n4. The `data` list provided contains only positive integers: `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`.\n5. When we apply the function to this list, we get:\n   - Total = 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 50 = 150\n   - Length of the list = 5\n   - Average = 150 / 5 = 30\n6. The condition in the code checks if the average is greater than 25, and based on our calculation, it would be.\n7. However, the question asks if the average will always be a positive number when the data list contains only positive integers.\n\nGiven that all numbers in the list are positive, the sum of these numbers will also be positive. Dividing a positive sum by the count of positive numbers (which is also positive) will always yield a positive result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The condition checks if the calculated average is greater than 25.\n\nNow, considering the question: \"If the data list contains only positive integers, will the average always be a positive number?\"\n\n5. Positive integers are numbers greater than zero.\n6. When we sum up multiple positive integers, the result will also be a positive number (since any combination of positive numbers added together remains positive).\n7. Dividing a positive number by another positive number (the length of the list, which is also positive) will always result in a positive number.\n\nTherefore, if the data list contains only positive integers, the average will indeed always be a positive number.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Since all elements are positive integers, their sum will also be a positive integer.\n\n3. **Average Calculation**: The `average` is calculated by dividing the `total` (which is positive) by the length of `data_list` (which is also positive since it contains at least one element). Dividing a positive number by another positive number always results in a positive number.\n\n4. **Output Determination**: The output is determined based on whether the `average` is greater than 25. However, the question specifically asks if the average will always be a positive number, regardless of its value relative to 25.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that the average will always be a positive number because it is the result of dividing a positive sum by a positive count.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

This list contains only positive integers.\n\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The function `process_data` calculates the sum of the elements in `data_list` using the line `total = sum(data_list)`. Since all elements in the list are positive integers, their sum (`total`) will also be a positive integer.\n\n3. **Average Calculation**: The average is calculated using the formula `average = total / len(data_list)`. Here, `total` is a positive integer (as established in step 2), and `len(data_list)` is the count of elements in the list, which is 5 (also a positive integer).\n\n4. **Division of Positive Numbers**: When you divide a positive integer by another positive integer, the result (the average in this case) can either be a positive integer or a positive floating-point number.
