  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The `calculate_demand` function sets higher base demand for sunny weather (120) compared to rainy (80) without considering other variables like holiday or marketing campaign. Thus, changing the weather to rainy will reduce the base demand irrespective of any interventions.",
  "causal_map": "weather → base_demand; weather → holiday",
  "causal_map_integration": "Changes in weather directly affect base_demand. Sunny weather increases base_demand to 120, rainy weather decreases it to 80, and snowy weather further decreases it to 50. Weather also indirectly affects holidays, but the primary impact is on base_demand.",

However, the question does not mention that the weather changed while it was already a holiday, so we'll assume it's not a holiday for simplicity.\n\n4. **Marketing Campaigns**:\n   - The marketing campaign can increase the demand further, but it doesn't affect the base_demand calculation directly.
