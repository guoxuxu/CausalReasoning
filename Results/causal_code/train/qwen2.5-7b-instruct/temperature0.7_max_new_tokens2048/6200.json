    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `classify_student(scores)` classifies a student based on their scores in math and science.\n\n2.

If the first condition (`scores['math'] > 90`) is not met, the function does not check the second condition (`scores['science'] > 85`), and instead evaluates other conditions for different classifications.\n\n5. Therefore, for a student to be classified as 'high', it is necessary that their math score is greater than 90.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that if a student is classified as 'high', they did indeed likely score more than 90 in math.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's break down the logic of the `classify_student` function step by step:\n\n1.

For all other cases, the student is classified as 'average'.\n\nNow, let's focus on the condition for classifying a student as 'high'.
