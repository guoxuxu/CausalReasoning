    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Class Definition**: The class `Employee` is defined with a constructor that takes two parameters: `name` and `isManager`.\n\n2. **Constructor Logic**:\n   - If `isManager` is true, the salary is set to 5000.\n   - If `isManager` is false, the salary is set to 3000.\n\n3. **Question Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if the salary will always initialize to 5000 when `isManager` is set to true.\n\n4. **Code Inspection**:\n   - The line of code responsible for setting the initial salary is: `this.salary = isManager ? 5000 : 3000;`\n   - This is a ternary operator that checks the value of `isManager`.\n   - When `isManager` is true, the condition evaluates to `true`, and the salary is set to 5000.\n   - When `isManager` is false, the condition evaluates to `false`, and the salary is set to 3000.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - According to the provided code, when `isManager` is true, the salary will indeed initialize to 5000.\n\nBased on this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the initialization of the `salary` property in the `Employee` class:\n\n1. The `Employee` class has a constructor that takes two parameters: `name` and `isManager`.\n2. Inside the constructor, there is an assignment for the `salary` property.\n3. The value of `salary` is determined based on the value of `isManager`:\n   - If `isManager` is `true`, then `salary` is assigned the value `5000`.\n   - If `isManager` is `false`, then `salary` is assigned the value `3000`.\n\nGiven that the condition checks whether `isManager` is `true`, we can conclude that when `isManager` is set to `true`, the `salary` will indeed initialize to `5000`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the code and analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The class `Employee` has a constructor that initializes an employee with a `name` and a boolean `isManager`.\n\n2. The constructor sets the `salary` based on the value of `isManager`:\n   - If `isManager` is true, the salary is set to 5000.\n   - If `isManager` is false, the salary is set to 3000.\n\n3. The `updateSalary` method adjusts the salary based on the `increment` amount. This method does not change the initial salary setting.\n\n4. The `reportIssue` method returns different strings based on whether the employee is a manager or not, but it doesn't affect the salary initialization.\n\nGiven the constructor logic, we can see that when `isManager` is set to true, the salary is explicitly initialized to 5000.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"If the property `isManager` is set to true, will the salary always initialize to 5000?\" is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The question specifically asks about the case where `isManager` is set to true.\n\n4. When `isManager` is true, the constructor explicitly sets the `salary` to 5000.\n\n5. There are no other parts of the code that would change this initial setting after construction.\n\nTherefore, if `isManager` is set to true, the salary will always initialize to 5000.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
