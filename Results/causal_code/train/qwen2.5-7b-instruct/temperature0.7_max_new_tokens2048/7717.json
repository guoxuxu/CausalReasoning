    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We have an object of the WeatherSystem class with `isCloudy` set to true and `temperature` unchanged (let's assume it's some value less than 20 for this scenario).\n\n2. The `willItRain()` method checks two conditions:\n   - `isCloudy` must be true\n   - `temperature` must be less than 20\n\n3. In our case, `isCloudy` is true (as per the problem statement).\n\n4. We need to check if `temperature` is less than 20. Since the problem states that `temperature` is unchanged, we can assume it meets this condition as well.\n\n5. If both conditions are met, `willItRain()` returns true.\n\n6. Therefore, with `isCloudy` being true and `temperature` being less than 20, `willItRain()` will indeed return true.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: \n   - `isCloudy` is set to `true`.\n   - The temperature is unchanged, which means it remains as it was when the `WeatherSystem` object was instantiated.\n\n2. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `isCloudy → willItRain`: This means that if `isCloudy` is `true`, `willItRain()` can potentially return `true`.\n   - `temperature < 20 → willItRain`: This means that if the temperature is less than 20, `willItRain()` can also potentially return `true`.\n\n3. **Evaluation of willItRain()**:\n   - The method `willItRain()` checks two conditions:\n     1. If `isCloudy` is `true` AND\n     2.

The problem states that the temperature is \"unchanged,\" but we need to consider the condition `temperature < 20`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since `isCloudy` is `true`, one of the conditions for `willItRain()` is met.\n   - For `willItRain()` to return `true`, the second condition (`temperature < 20`) must also be met.\n   - Without knowing the exact initial temperature, we cannot definitively say whether `temperature < 20` is true or false. However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine if the temperature is below 20 after being unchanged from its initial state.\n\nGiven the lack of specific temperature information, we cannot conclusively state that `willItRain()` will return `true`.
