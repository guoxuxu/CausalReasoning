    "Let's analyze the code step by step:\n\n1. The `updateTemperature()` method checks if `currentTemperature` is less than `setTemperature`.\n2.

If `currentTemperature` is not less than `setTemperature`, it sets `isHeating` to `false`.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where `currentTemperature` is equal to `setTemperature`:\n- Since `currentTemperature` is equal to `setTemperature`, the condition `currentTemperature < setTemperature` will be false.\n- Therefore, the block of code inside the `else` statement will be executed.\n- In this block, `isHeating` is set to `false`.\n\nBased on this reasoning, if `currentTemperature` is equal to `setTemperature`, the `isHeating` variable will indeed be set to `false`.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Since the condition is false, we follow the \"else\" part of the if-else statement.\n\n8.
