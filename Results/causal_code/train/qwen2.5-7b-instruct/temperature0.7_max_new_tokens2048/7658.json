  "Question Type": "from effect to cause without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Since 'status' is set to 'high' only if 'multiplied' (which is 'value' multiplied by 5) exceeds 20, the minimum 'value' to achieve this is indeed 4.1 (and naturally, due to programming generally dealing with integer values, it needs to round up to the next integer greater than 4, which is 5).",
