    "Let's break down the logic of the `compute_impact` function step by step:\n\n1. The function takes three parameters: `sales`, `marketing_budget`, and `economy_index`.\n2. It first checks the value of `economy_index`:\n   - If `economy_index > 50`, it increases `sales` by 10%.\n   - Otherwise, it increases `sales` by 5%.\n3. Then, it checks the value of `marketing_budget`:\n   - If `marketing_budget > 1000`, it further increases `sales` by 20%.\n4. Finally, it returns the updated `sales`.\n\nNow, let's focus on the specific case where the marketing budget is set to 1200.\n\n- Since 1200 is greater than 1000, the condition `if marketing_budget > 1000` will be true.\n- This means that regardless of the value of `economy_index`, the function will always increase `sales` by an additional 20%.\n\nTherefore, setting the marketing budget to 1200 will indeed cause sales to increase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_impact` takes three parameters: `sales`, `marketing_budget`, and `economy_index`.\n2. We need to determine if setting the `marketing_budget` to 1200 will likely result in an increase in `sales`.\n\nNow let's analyze the conditions under which the sales might increase:\n\n3. If `economy_index > 50`, then `sales` increases by 10% of its current value.\n4. If `marketing_budget > 1000`, then `sales` increases by an additional 20% of its current value.\n\nGiven that we are setting the `marketing_budget` to 1200:\n\n5. Since 1200 is greater than 1000, the second condition will be met, leading to an additional 20% increase in `sales`.\n\nThe question does not provide information about the `economy_index`, but even without knowing its exact value, we can still conclude that the `marketing_budget` being above 1000 will trigger the second condition, thus ensuring an increase in `sales`.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
