Based on the provided causal relationships, the application of the discount (`applyDiscount`) is not triggered by checking `totalSales()`.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Sales Data Recording**:\n   - `sales.recordSale(100)` records a sale of $100.\n   - `sales.recordSale(200)` records another sale of $200.\n\n2. **Current State of Sales Array**:\n   - The `this.sales` array will now contain `[100, 200]`.\n\n3. **Applying Discount**:\n   - `sales.applyDiscount(0.1)` applies a 10% discount to each sale.\n   - This means each sale amount is multiplied by `(1 - 0.1) = 0.9`.\n   - After applying the discount, the `this.sales` array becomes `[90, 180]`.\n\n4. **Calculating Total Sales**:\n   - `sales.totalSales()` calculates the sum of the elements in the `this.sales` array.\n   - The total sales after applying the discount is `90 + 180 = 270`.\n\nNow, let's consider the causal relationships provided:\n- `recordSale → totalSales`: This is true because recording a sale updates the `this.sales` array, which is used to calculate the total sales.\n- `recordSale → applyDiscount`: This is also true because recording a sale updates the `this.sales` array, which is then modified by the `applyDiscount` method.\n- `applyDiscount → totalSales`: This is true because applying a discount modifies the `this.sales` array, which is subsequently used to calculate the total sales.\n\nHowever, the question asks if \"checking totalSales()\" is the reason why discounts are applied on sales.

The discount is applied as part of a separate method call, not as a result of or in response to checking the total sales.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, checking `totalSales()` is not the reason why discounts are applied on sales.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
