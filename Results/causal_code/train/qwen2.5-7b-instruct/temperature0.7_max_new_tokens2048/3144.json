    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We have a `HealthTracker` class with methods for exercising, working, and relaxing.\n2. The `exercise` method takes a `duration` parameter.\n3. If the `duration` is greater than 60 minutes, the health increases by 10 units.\n4. If the `duration` is 60 minutes or less, the health increases by 5 units.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific scenario where the duration of exercise is set to 120 minutes:\n\n- Since 120 minutes is greater than 60 minutes, we follow the condition in the `if` statement.\n- According to the code, when `duration > 60`, the health increases by 10 units.\n\nThe question asks if setting the duration to 120 minutes will result in more than a 5-unit increase in health automatically.\n\n- A 10-unit increase is indeed more than a 5-unit increase.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `exercise` method takes a parameter `duration`.\n2. If `duration` is greater than 60, the health is increased by 10 units.\n3. If `duration` is 60 or less, the health is increased by 5 units.\n\nGiven that the person sets the duration of exercise to 120 minutes:\n\n4. Since 120 is greater than 60, we follow the condition where `duration > 60`.\n5. According to the method definition, when `duration > 60`, the health is increased by 10 units.\n\nNow, let's compare:\n- The increase in health due to setting `duration` to 120 is 10 units.\n- The question asks if this results in \"more than a 5-unit increase in health automatically.\"\n\nSince 10 units is indeed more than 5 units, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `exercise` method takes a parameter `duration`.\n2. If `duration` is greater than 60, the method adds 10 to `self.health`.\n3. If `duration` is not greater than 60 (i.e., 60 or less), the method adds 5 to `self.health`.\n\nIn this case, the duration set is 120 minutes, which is greater than 60.\n\nAccording to the method definition:\n- For `duration > 60`, the health increases by 10 units.\n\nSince 120 is indeed greater than 60, the health will increase by 10 units.\n\nNow, we need to determine if this results in more than a 5-unit increase:\n- A 10-unit increase is more than a 5-unit increase.\n\nTherefore, setting the duration of exercise to 120 minutes will result in more than a 5-unit increase in health.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
