    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` calculates the final score based on several factors:\n   - `base_score`: The initial score.\n   - `bonus`: Additional points to be added.\n   - `penalty`: Points to be subtracted.\n   - `high_score_bonus_enabled`: A boolean indicating whether the high score bonus is enabled.\n\n2. If `base_score > 90` and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`, the function adds 20 to the `bonus`.\n\n3. The final score is calculated as:\n   - `final_score = base_score + bonus - penalty`\n\n4. If the `final_score` exceeds 100, it is capped at 100.\n\n5. The question asks if `final_score` equals 100, can we conclude that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was `True`?\n\nTo reason through this:\n\n- For `final_score` to equal 100, the addition of the high score bonus (if applicable) must not push the score over 100.\n- If `high_score_bonus_enabled` were `False`, the maximum possible score would be `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n- For this maximum score to be exactly 100, all other conditions must align perfectly, but there's no guarantee that `high_score_bonus_enabled` being `False` would prevent the score from being exactly 100.\n- Conversely, if `high_score_bonus_enabled` were `True` and `base_score` was sufficiently high (greater than 90), it could contribute to making the final score 100.\n\nHowever, the critical point is that the function does not have a mechanism to force `final_score` to 100 if `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `False`. Therefore, for `final_score` to be exactly 100, `high_score_bonus_enabled` must be `True` because the additional 20 points would otherwise make the score exceed 100 if capped.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` calculates the final score based on several parameters.\n2. If `base_score` is greater than 90 and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True, then `bonus` is increased by 20.\n3. The final score is calculated as `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n4. If the final score exceeds 100, it is capped at 100.\n\nTo determine if we can conclude that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was True when the final score equals 100, let's consider the conditions under which the final score could be 100:\n\n- For the final score to be exactly 100, the condition `final_score > 100` must not trigger (since it would cap the score at 100).\n- This means that the calculation `base_score + bonus - penalty` must result in a value less than or equal to 100.\n\nNow, let's analyze the scenarios:\n\n1. **If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is False**:\n   - The bonus does not increase by 20.\n   - The maximum possible final score without the bonus is `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n   - Even if `base_score` is very high, the final score will still depend on the values of `bonus` and `penalty`.\n\n2. **If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True**:\n   - The bonus increases by 20.\n   - With a sufficiently high `base_score`, the final score can reach 100 if the increase from the bonus compensates for the penalty.\n\nGiven these points, the final score being 100 does not necessarily mean that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was True. It is possible for the final score to be 100 even if the bonus was not added due to a low enough `base_score` or a high enough penalty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclusively determine that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was True just from knowing the final score is 100.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` takes four parameters:\n   - `base_score`: The initial score.\n   - `bonus`: An additional bonus to be added.\n   - `penalty`: A penalty to be subtracted.\n   - `high_score_bonus_enabled`: A boolean indicating whether a high score bonus is enabled.\n\n2. The function checks if `base_score > 90` and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`. If both conditions are met, it adds 20 to the `bonus`.\n\n3. The final score is calculated as `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n\n4. If the final score exceeds 100, it is capped at 100.\n\n5. We need to determine if `final_score` being 100 implies that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was `True`.\n\n6. For `final_score` to reach 100, the following must be true:\n   - The base score plus the adjusted bonus minus the penalty must be at least 100.\n   - This could happen in two scenarios:\n     a) If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`, then an additional 20 is added to the bonus.\n     b) If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `False`, the base score must already be very high (likely over 80) to reach 100 after adding any bonus and subtracting any penalty.\n\n7. However, the key point is that the function does not allow `final_score` to exceed 100 even if `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`. So, if `final_score` is exactly 100, it means the maximum cap was applied.\n\n8. Given that the cap is applied when `final_score` would otherwise be above 100, and considering the condition for adding the 20-point bonus only when `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`, we can conclude that if `final_score` is exactly 100, it must mean that the 20-point bonus was not added.\n\nTherefore, if `final_score` equals 100, we cannot conclude that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was `True`.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` takes four parameters:\n   - `base_score`\n   - `bonus`\n   - `penalty`\n   - `high_score_bonus_enabled`\n\n2. The conditions for adding a bonus of 20 are:\n   - `base_score > 90`\n   - `high_score_bonus_enabled` must be `True`\n\n3. The calculation for the final score is:\n   - `final_score = base_score + bonus - penalty`\n   - If `final_score > 100`, it is capped at 100.\n\n4. We need to determine if `high_score_bonus_enabled` being `True` is a necessary condition for `final_score` to equal 100.\n\n5. Let's consider the scenario where `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `False`:\n   - Even if `base_score` is greater than 90, no bonus will be added.\n   - This means the maximum possible `final_score` without the high score bonus would be `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n   - For `final_score` to reach 100, the value of `base_score + bonus - penalty` must be at least 100 (or exactly 100 if penalties are applied).\n\n6. Now, let's consider the scenario where `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`:\n   - If `base_score > 90`, a 20-point bonus is added.\n   - This increases the potential `final_score` by 20 points.\n   - However, even with this bonus, the `final_score` could still not reach 100 if `base_score + bonus - penalty < 80`.\n\n7. Conclusion:\n   - While having `high_score_bonus_enabled` as `True` increases the likelihood of reaching a `final_score` of 100, it is not a guarantee.\n   - It is possible to have `final_score` equal 100 without `high_score_bonus_enabled` being `True` (if the other conditions allow it).\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclusively say that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was `True` just because `final_score` equals 100.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The function `compute_final_score` calculates the final score based on the base score, bonus, penalty, and whether a high score bonus is enabled.\n\n2. For the final score to equal 100, consider the following:\n   - The final score is capped at 100.\n   - If the final score exceeds 100, it is set to 100.\n\n3. To reach exactly 100, the calculation `base_score + bonus - penalty` must be 100 or less.\n\n4. The condition for adding a bonus of 20 (if `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True) is:\n   - `base_score > 90`\n   - `high_score_bonus_enabled` must be True\n\n5. Let's consider the scenario where `high_score_bonus_enabled` is False:\n   - Even if `base_score > 90`, no additional bonus of 20 is added.\n   - Therefore, the maximum possible score without the bonus is `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n   - Given that `base_score` cannot exceed 100, and assuming `bonus` and `penalty` do not significantly alter the score, it is highly unlikely to reach exactly 100 without the bonus.\n\n6. Conversely, if `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True and `base_score > 90`, the score can potentially be increased by 20, making it easier to reach 100.\n\nGiven these points, we can reason that if the final score is exactly 100, it is highly probable that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was True, as the bonus of 20 would be added under this condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Conditions for Final Score to be 100**:\n   - The function sets `final_score` to 100 if it exceeds 100.\n   - For `final_score` to be 100, the expression `base_score + bonus - penalty` must be greater than 100.\n\n2. **Conditions for Bonus Increase**:\n   - If `base_score > 90` and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True, then `bonus` increases by 20.\n   - Even if `high_score_bonus_enabled` is False, `bonus` could still increase by 20 if `base_score > 90`.\n\n3. **Expression Analysis**:\n   - To make `final_score` exactly 100, the sum of `base_score + bonus - penalty` must be at least 100.\n   - If `base_score` is not greater than 90, `bonus` will not increase by 20, making it harder to reach 100 without exceeding it.\n\n4. **Scenario Testing**:\n   - Let's assume `base_score = 95`, `bonus = 20` (due to `base_score > 90`), and `penalty = 0`.\n     - Then `final_score = 95 + 20 - 0 = 115`, which would be capped at 100.\n   - If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is False, `bonus` would not increase, and it would be more difficult to reach 100 unless `base_score` is very high and `penalty` is low.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While having `high_score_bonus_enabled` as True helps, it is not the only condition. However, if `final_score` is 100, it strongly suggests that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was True because it is one of the ways to increase the bonus significantly.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot definitively conclude that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was True just from the fact that `final_score` equals 100.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine if we can conclude that `high_score_bonus_enabled` was True when `final_score` equals 100.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Condition for Final Score to be 100:**\n   - The function sets `final_score` to 100 only if it exceeds 100 after computing `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n\n2. **Conditions for Bonus Addition:**\n   - There are two conditions under which `bonus` can increase by 20:\n     - If `base_score > 90` (regardless of `high_score_bonus_enabled`).\n     - If `high_score_bonus_enabled` is `True`.\n\n3. **Final Score Calculation:**\n   - The formula for `final_score` is: `base_score + bonus - penalty`.\n   - For `final_score` to be exactly 100, the value must be capped at 100 because if it exceeds 100, the function explicitly sets it to 100.\n\n4. **Analysis When `final_score` = 100:**\n   - To reach `final_score` = 100, the maximum possible value of `base_score + bonus - penalty` must be 100.\n   - This implies that `bonus` must have its maximum possible value (20 from either condition) and `penalty` must be minimized or zero.\n\n5. **Implication on `high_score_bonus_enabled`:**\n   - If `high_score_bonus_enabled` were `False`, the only way to get a bonus of 20 would be if `base_score > 90`. However, even with `base_score > 90`, there is no guarantee that `final_score` will be exactly 100 unless `penalty` is also minimized.\n   - Therefore, for `final_score` to be exactly 100, `high_score_bonus_enabled` must be `True` to ensure the additional bonus of 20 points is added.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that `final_score` equals 100, we can conclude that `high_score_bonus_enabled` must have been `True` to ensure the additional bonus is added, contributing to the final score reaching exactly 100.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

If `base_score` is sufficiently high (greater than 90) and `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True, then `bonus` will be increased by 20, making it more likely for `final_score` to exceed 100.\n     2. Without `high_score_bonus_enabled` being True, the score would need to be even higher to reach 100 because the bonus from `high_score_bonus_enabled` is 20 points.\n\n3. **Consider the given causal relationships:**\n   - `base_score > 90 → bonus += 20`: This means if the base score is over 90, the bonus increases by 20 regardless of `high_score_bonus_enabled`.\n   - `high_score_bonus_enabled → bonus += 20`: This means the bonus also increases by 20 if `high_score_bonus_enabled` is True.\n\n4. **Determine the necessary condition for `final_score` to be 100:**\n   - To ensure `final_score` reaches 100, the increase in bonus due to `high_score_bonus_enabled` plays a crucial role. If `high_score_bonus_enabled` were False, the base score would need to be much higher to compensate for the lack of additional bonus points.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the presence of `high_score_bonus_enabled` directly contributes to increasing the score by 20 points, which is significant in reaching 100, it is reasonable to conclude that `high_score_bonus_enabled` must have been True for `final_score` to be 100.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",
