  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "With an intervention that forces the trend to always be 105, the if condition in the code will consistently evaluate to true for the trend being greater than 100, resulting in the market status being permanently 'rising'.",
