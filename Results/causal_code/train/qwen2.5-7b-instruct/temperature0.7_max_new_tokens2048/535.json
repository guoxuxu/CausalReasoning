  "Explanation": "Given the price of product_a is 60 which is over 50, and the marketing budget increases from 1200 to 1500, the sales figures' increment due to this budget would remain the same (at an increase of 200), since both budgets are over 1000.",

Specifically, if the product's price is greater than 50 and the marketing_budget exceeds 1000, a marketing_budget of 1500 will result in an additional 300 units of sales_figures.",
