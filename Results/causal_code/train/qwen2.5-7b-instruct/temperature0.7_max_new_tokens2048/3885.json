    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `update_scores` takes three parameters: `scores`, `bonus`, and `penalty`.\n\n2. It iterates over each key in the `scores` dictionary.\n\n3. For keys containing 'team_a', it adds `bonus` to the value.\n4. For other keys (which in this case is only 'team_b'), it subtracts `penalty` from the value.\n\n5. Given the initial values:\n   - `bonus_points = 10`\n   - `penalty_points = 5`\n   - `score_dict = {'team_a_score': 100, 'team_b_score': 150}`\n\n6. After calling `update_scores(score_dict, bonus_points, penalty_points)`, the resulting `score_dict` will be:\n   - `{'team_a_score': 110, 'team_b_score': 145}`\n\n7. The question asks if setting `team_b_score` to a value lower than its initial value necessarily means that `penalty_points` increased.\n\n8. From the code logic, we can see that `team_b_score` is decreased by `penalty_points`. If `team_b_score` was set to a lower value after the function call, it could have been due to:\n   - The original `penalty_points` being applied.\n   - A different penalty being applied (if `penalty_points` had changed).\n   - Some other operation that decreased `team_b_score`.\n\n9. However, without additional information, we cannot conclude that `penalty_points` necessarily increased just because `team_b_score` was set to a lower value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
