    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `generate_weather()` function randomly selects one of three weather options: 'sunny', 'rainy', or 'cloudy'.\n\n2. If we intervene to ensure the weather is 'sunny', we are directly setting `weather_today` to 'sunny' without relying on the random selection.\n\n3. The `plan_activity(weather)` function checks the weather condition:\n   - If it's 'sunny', it assigns 'picnic' as the activity.\n   - If it's 'rainy', it assigns 'watching movies' as the activity.\n   - If it's 'cloudy', it assigns 'reading' as the activity.\n\n4. Since we are explicitly setting `weather_today` to 'sunny' with our intervention, the function `plan_activity(weather_today)` will see that `weather_today` is 'sunny'.\n\n5.
