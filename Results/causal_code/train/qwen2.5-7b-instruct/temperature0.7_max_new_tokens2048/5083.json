    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have a ShoppingCart class with methods to add and remove items, apply discounts, and calculate tax.\n\n2. The add_item method takes two parameters: item and price.\n   - It appends a tuple (item, price) to the items list.\n   - It adds the price to the total attribute.\n\n3. When we call add_item, it directly adds the price of the item to the total cost.\n\n4. There's no condition or logic that would prevent or modify this addition.\n\n5. Therefore, every time we add an item, its price is added to the total cost.\n\nBased on this reasoning, adding an item to the shopping cart does indeed increase the total cost.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's think through this step by step:\n\n1. The `ShoppingCart` class is defined with methods to manage items and costs.\n2. The `add_item` method takes an item and its price as parameters.\n3. When `add_item` is called, it appends a tuple containing the item and its price to the `items` list.\n4. Simultaneously, it adds the price of the item to the `total` attribute.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that when an item is added to the shopping cart using the `add_item` method, the price of that item is directly added to the `total` cost of the cart.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

Adds the item and its price to the `items` list.\n     2. Increases the `total` attribute by the price of the added item.\n\n3. **Impact on Total Cost**:\n   - Since the `total` attribute is directly modified by adding the price of the item, every time `add_item` is called, the `total` cost increases by the price of the added item.\n\n4. **Causal Relationship**:\n   - The causal relationship provided states \"add_item → total\".
