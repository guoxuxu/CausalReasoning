    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - The `VaccineDistribution` class is defined with attributes for `production_rate` and `distribution_capacity`.\n   - The `distribute_vaccines` method calculates how many vaccines can be distributed based on the production rate and the current distribution capacity.\n\n2. **Current Distribution Logic**:\n   - Each month, the number of vaccines produced (`vaccines_produced`) is calculated as `self.production_rate * 30`.\n   - If the number of vaccines produced exceeds the distribution capacity, only the distribution capacity amount is used.\n   - Coverage is then calculated as the ratio of distributed vaccines to the population.\n\n3. **Government Intervention**:\n   - The government subsidizes infrastructure to double the distribution capacity.\n   - This means the `distribution_capacity` attribute will be set to twice its original value.\n\n4. **Effect on Coverage**:\n   - With a stable production rate, the number of vaccines produced each month remains the same.\n   - However, since the distribution capacity has doubled, more vaccines can now be distributed without exceeding the capacity limit.\n   - As a result, the numerator (distributed vaccines) in the coverage calculation will increase, leading to an overall increase in vaccination coverage.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that the vaccination coverage will indeed increase after the government intervention.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
