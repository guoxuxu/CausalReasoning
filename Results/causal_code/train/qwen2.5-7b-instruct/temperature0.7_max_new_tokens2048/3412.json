  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Currently, a single call of 'water()' adds 5 units and 'dayPasses()' subtracts 4 units, which barely affects the plant's health positively. Increasing water added by 'water()' to 7 units results in a net gain in water level even after 'dayPasses()' (7-4=3 units). Therefore, this intervention (increasing water units) enables a single watering to maintain or improve the plant's health after a day passes.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's understand the current behavior:\n   - `waterLevel` starts at 0.\n   - `water()` adds 5 units of water.\n   - `soakSun()` adds 3 units of water.\n   - `dayPasses()` subtracts 4 units of water.\n\n2.
