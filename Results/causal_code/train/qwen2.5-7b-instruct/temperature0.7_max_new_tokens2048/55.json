    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the `willPeopleGoOutside()` method**:\n   - This method checks two conditions:\n     1.1. The day must be sunny (`isSunny` must be true).\n     1.2. The temperature must be greater than 25 degrees.\n\n2. **Effect of setting all days to be sunny**:\n   - If we set all days to be sunny using the `setWeather(true, temp)` method, the condition `isSunny` will always be true.\n   \n3. **Impact on the `willPeopleGoOutside()` method**:\n   - With `isSunny` always being true, the first condition of `willPeopleGoOutside()` is always satisfied.\n   - Therefore, the method will now only check if the temperature is greater than 25 degrees.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - After setting all days to be sunny, the temperatures do not need to be specifically above 25 degrees for people to go outside.
