    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The `TrafficLightsSystem` class has an attribute `is_rainy` which indicates whether it has rained.\n2. The `light_color` attribute starts as 'Green' when initialized.\n3.

The `is_safe_to_go` method checks if it's safe to go based on the current light color and weather conditions:\n   - If it has rained and the light is 'Yellow', it returns False.\n   - If the light is 'Red', it returns False.\n   - Otherwise, it returns True.\n\nNow, we need to determine if the traffic light being 'Yellow' means it has rained before.\n\n5. For the light to be 'Yellow', two conditions must be met:\n   - It must have rained (so `is_rainy` is True).\n   - The light must have changed from 'Green' due to rain, not from 'Red'.\n\nGiven that the light is currently 'Yellow', we can conclude that it has indeed rained before.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

The `is_safe_to_go` method checks if the light is Yellow during rainy conditions or Red at any time, returning False in those cases. Otherwise, it returns True.\n\n4.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The initial state of the traffic light system is set when `TrafficLightsSystem` is instantiated.\n2. The `change_light` method updates the light color based on whether it is raining.\n3. The `is_safe_to_go` method checks if it is safe to go based on both the current light color and whether it is raining.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where the traffic light is Yellow:\n\n- For the light to be Yellow, the condition must be that it is raining (`is_rainy` is True). This is because the only way to change from Green to Yellow is if `is_rainy` is True.\n- If it is raining and the light changes to Yellow, it implies that the previous light color was Green (since the only transition to Yellow happens from Green).\n- The system then checks if it is safe to go. Since it is raining and the light is Yellow, `is_safe_to_go` returns False.\n\nGiven this chain of events, we can conclude that if the traffic light is Yellow, it must have rained before, as the transition to Yellow can only occur if it is currently raining.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `TrafficLightsSystem` is initialized with a boolean value `is_rainy`. Depending on whether it is rainy or not, the initial light color is set to 'Green'.\n\n2. **Change Light Method**:\n   - If it is raining (`is_rainy` is True), the light changes to 'Yellow'.\n   - Otherwise, the light cycles between 'Green' and 'Red'.\n\n3. **Is Safe to Go Method**:\n   - If it is raining and the light is 'Yellow', the method returns `False`.\n   - If the light is 'Red', the method also returns `False`.\n   - In all other cases, the method returns `True`.\n\n4. **Question**: \"If the traffic light is Yellow, has it rained before?\"\n\n5. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - `is_rainy` affects the `light_color`.\n   - `is_rainy` affects the `is_safe_to_go` method.\n   - `light_color` affects the `is_safe_to_go` method.\n\nGiven that the traffic light is currently 'Yellow', let's consider the sequence of events leading to this state:\n\n- For the light to be 'Yellow', the condition `is_rainy` must be `True` (since otherwise, it would cycle between 'Green' and 'Red').\n- Therefore, if the light is 'Yellow', it indicates that it has rained at some point.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

For the light to be Yellow, the `change_light` method must have been called in a rainy condition because only then does it change from Green to Yellow.\n\n4. If it has rained, the light could either be Yellow (if just changed) or Red (if it was previously Yellow and then changed to Red).\n\n5. Since the light being Yellow directly corresponds to a recent rain event (as per the rules of the system), we can infer that if the light is Yellow, it must have rained at some point.\n\n6. However, the question asks specifically if it has rained \"before,\" which implies a past event.
