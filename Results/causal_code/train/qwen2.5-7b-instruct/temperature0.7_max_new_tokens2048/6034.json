  "Question Type": "from effect to cause with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "The non-decrease in healthLevel after an event attempt could indeed be due to the simulator being deactivated (isActive set to false). However, it can also be because no event was actually triggered (due, for instance, to a programming error or another part of the code preventing triggerEvent from being called). This uncertainty means we cannot definitively conclude deactivation solely based on healthLevel not decreasing.",
