  "Explanation": "In the original setup without interventions like the promotion, an increase in demand cannot be directly inferred from a change in tax rate alone as demand's calculation also depends heavily on price and discount factors. Unless these are controlled, a mere increase in demand isn't sufficient to infer reduced tax rates.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function `compute_sales` calculates the total price and demand based on the given inputs (price, tax_rate, and discount).\n\n2. The relationship between these variables is as follows:\n   - `total_price` = `price + (price * tax_rate) - discount`\n   - `demand` = `max(0, 100 - total_price)`\n\n3. The `promotion_effect` function increases the demand by 20, but it does not directly affect the tax rate.\n\n4. We need to determine if a significant increase in demand can suggest a reduction in the tax rate without any intervention.\n\n5. Let's analyze what happens when we change the tax rate:\n   - If the tax rate decreases, the `tax_amount` will decrease, which in turn will reduce the `total_price`.\n   - A lower `total_price` would result in higher `demand`, as the value of `100 - total_price` would be larger.\n\n6. However, the problem states that there was no intervention, only a promotional campaign that increased demand by 20. This means the tax rate remained constant at 0.05.\n\n7.
