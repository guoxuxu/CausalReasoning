In the Fourier domain, the second time derivative transforms to \\((-i\\omega)^2 = -\\omega^2\\), and the Laplacian term remains unchanged because it does not depend on time. Thus, the transformed PDE becomes:\n   \\[\n   -\\omega^2 \\hat{u}(\\omega, \\mathbf{x}) = c^2 \\nabla^2 \\hat{u}(\\omega, \\mathbf{x}),\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, \\mathbf{x})\\) is the Fourier transform of \\(u(t, \\mathbf{x})\\).\n\n4. **Solving the Transformed Equation**: Solving this transformed PDE for \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, \\mathbf{x})\\) gives us the solution in the frequency domain. The dynamics at each frequency \\(\\omega\\) are determined by the equation above.\n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To get back to the time domain, we take the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   u(t, \\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i\\omega t} \\hat{u}(\\omega, \\mathbf{x}) d\\omega.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Comparison**: The solution obtained from solving the transformed PDE and then taking the inverse Fourier transform should be equivalent to the solution obtained by directly solving the original PDE in the time domain. This is due to the linearity and time-invariance properties of the wave equation, and the fact that the Fourier transform is a linear operation.\n\nTherefore, the transformed solution at frequency \\(\\omega\\) will indeed reveal the same dynamics as if \\(u(t)\\) was directly solved without transformation.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
