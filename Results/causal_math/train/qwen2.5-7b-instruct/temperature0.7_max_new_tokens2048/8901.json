  "Explanation": "Since \\\\( f(z) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) is simply the zero vector (due to the integral of zero), the subsequent evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) remains unaltered. Therefore, it follows the prescribed exponential map \\\\( e^{At}x \\\\), resulting in the same state at any \\\\( t = T \\\\) as if the transformation was never applied.",
