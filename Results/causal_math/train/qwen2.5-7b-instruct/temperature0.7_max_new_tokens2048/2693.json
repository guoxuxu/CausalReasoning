    "To determine if the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) and the Fourier transform \\( G(\\omega) \\) of the function \\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\) will provide the same functional outcome without further transformations, we need to analyze both transforms separately.\n\n### Step 1: Compute the Laplace Transform \\( F(s) \\)\nThe Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is defined as:\n\\[ F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-at^2} e^{-st} dt \\]\n\nThis integral does not have a simple closed form solution that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

Specifically, \\( F(s) \\) includes an exponential term involving \\( s \\), while \\( G(\\omega) \\) does not include such a term. This indicates that the two transforms are not the same.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) and the Fourier transform \\( G(\\omega) \\) of \\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\) yield different functional outcomes, the answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
