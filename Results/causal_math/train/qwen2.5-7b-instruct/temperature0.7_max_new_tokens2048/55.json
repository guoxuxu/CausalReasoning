    "To answer this question, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Understand the initial conditions**: We have a function \\( f(z) = z^2 + 1 \\) and we're considering a contour integral over a closed path \\( C \\). The transformation \\( g(z) = z + ai \\) shifts the contour \\( C \\) vertically by \\( ai \\), resulting in a new contour \\( C' \\).\n\n2. **Effect of \\( g(z) \\)**: Applying \\( g(z) \\) to \\( C \\) to get \\( C' \\) means that every point \\( z \\) on \\( C \\) is mapped to \\( z + ai \\). This vertical shift does not change the value of the integral because the function \\( f(z) \\) is analytic everywhere except possibly at isolated points, and shifting the contour does not change the value of the integral for an analytic function over a closed path.\n\n3. **Applying \\( h(z) \\)**: Next, we apply \\( h(z) = z - bi \\) to \\( C' \\) to get \\( C'' \\). This transformation shifts the contour \\( C' \\) back horizontally by \\( bi \\). Again, since \\( f(z) \\) is analytic, the integral over \\( C'' \\) should be the same as the original integral over \\( C \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion about the dependency**: The transformations \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\) together do not affect the value of the integral because they are essentially inverse operations in the context of the contour integral, and the function \\( f(z) \\) remains unchanged throughout these transformations.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: The new integral \\( \\oint_{C''} f(z) \\, dz \\) does not depend on the nature of \\( f(z) \\) but rather on the transformations applied to the contour. However, the specific form of \\( f(z) \\) still influences the integrand, so strictly speaking, the integral does depend on \\( f(z) \\).\n\nGiven the context of the question, which seems to imply whether the integral's value changes due to transformations alone, the correct interpretation would be that the transformations themselves do not change the value of the integral for an analytic function.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Contour Integral**: We start with the integral \\(\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz\\) where \\(f(z) = z^2 + 1\\). The value of this integral depends on the function \\(f(z)\\) and the path \\(C\\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\(g(z) = z + ai\\)**: Applying \\(g(z)\\) shifts the contour \\(C\\) by \\(ai\\) vertically. This changes the contour from \\(C\\) to \\(C'\\). However, the integral \\(\\oint_{C'} f(z) \\, dz\\) is still dependent on the function \\(f(z)\\) because the function itself has been transformed.\n\n3. **Transformation \\(h(z) = z - bi\\)**: Applying \\(h(z)\\) further shifts the contour \\(C'\\) by \\(-bi\\) vertically. This changes the contour from \\(C'\\) to \\(C''\\). Again, the integral \\(\\oint_{C''} f(z) \\, dz\\) is dependent on \\(f(z)\\).\n\n4. **Effect of Transformations**: Both transformations \\(g(z)\\) and \\(h(z)\\) are linear translations in the complex plane. These transformations do not change the nature of the function \\(f(z)\\); they only translate the contour. The key point here is that the integral of a holomorphic function (which \\(f(z)\\) is, as it is a polynomial) over a closed contour is zero if the contour does not enclose any singularities of the function. Since \\(f(z) = z^2 + 1\\) is entire (no singularities), the integral over any closed contour is zero.\n\n5. **Final Integral**: Regardless of the transformations applied, since \\(f(z)\\) is holomorphic everywhere, the integral \\(\\oint_{C''} f(z) \\, dz\\) will be zero, just like \\(\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz\\).\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**: The integral \\(\\oint_{C''} f(z) \\, dz\\) does not depend on the nature of the transformations \\(g(z)\\) and \\(h(z)\\) alone; it depends on the fact that \\(f(z)\\) is holomorphic and the contour is closed. The transformations merely change the path but not the value of the integral due to the Cauchy-Goursat theorem.\n\nTherefore, the integral \\(\\oint_{C''} f(z) \\, dz\\) is indeed independent of the specific nature of the transformations applied, as long as the contour remains closed and \\(f(z)\\) remains holomorphic.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

This is a vertical shift upwards by \\(ai\\). The key point here is that such a shift does not change the value of the contour integral for polynomials like \\(f(z) = z^2 + 1\\).

    "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformations:**\n   - The original function is \\(f(z) = z^2 + 1\\).\n   - The first transformation is \\(g(z) = z + ai\\), which shifts the contour \\(C\\) vertically upwards by \\(ai\\).\n   - The second transformation is \\(h(z) = z - bi\\), which shifts the contour \\(C'\\) (the result of applying \\(g\\)) downwards by \\(bi\\).\n\n2. **Effect on the Contour:**\n   - Applying \\(g(z)\\) to \\(C\\) results in a new contour \\(C'\\) that is shifted from \\(C\\) by \\(ai\\).\n   - Applying \\(h(z)\\) to \\(C'\\) results in a contour \\(C''\\) that is shifted back by \\(-bi\\).

The key property here is that such a shift does not change the value of the integral for a polynomial function like \\(f(z) = z^2 + 1\\).
