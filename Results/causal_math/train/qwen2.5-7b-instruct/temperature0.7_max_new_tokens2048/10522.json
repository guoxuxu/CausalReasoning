    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The given function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a complex exponential function.

However, for \\( Z(s) \\), the inverse Laplace transform is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function.

This does not affect our ability to determine \\( \\omega \\) but rather tells us about the behavior of the system over time.\n\n7. **Determining \\( \\omega \\)**: Given only \\( Z(s) \\) without any additional information about the time-domain behavior or initial conditions, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( \\omega \\). The form of \\( Z(s) \\) is general and depends on \\( \\omega \\), but knowing just the transformed function does not provide enough constraints to solve for \\( \\omega \\) uniquely.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
