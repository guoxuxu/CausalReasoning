    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Transformation:**\n   - The initial function is \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which traces out the unit circle in the complex plane.\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), the function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied. This means that \\( z(t_1) \\) is transformed into \\( z(t_1)^2 \\).\n\n2. **Intervention and New Function:**\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), the intervention is to apply the new function \\( g(z) = z^3 \\).\n   - This means that the state of the system at \\( t_1 \\), which is now \\( z(t_1)^2 \\), is transformed into \\( (z(t_1)^2)^3 = z(t_1)^6 \\).\n\n3. **Behavior from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\):**\n   - From \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\), the system follows the original function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\). However, the state at \\( t_1 \\) has already been transformed by \\( g(z) \\).\n\n4. **Final State at Time \\( T \\):**\n   - The final state at time \\( T \\) is given by \\( z(T) \\). Since the system follows \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{iT}\n     \\]\n   - But because of the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the effective state at \\( t_1 \\) was \\( z(t_1)^6 \\). Therefore, the state at \\( T \\) can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = (z(t_1)^6)^{i(T-t_1)} = z(t_1)^{6i(T-t_1)}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( z(t_1) = e^{it_1} \\):\n     \\[\n     z(T) = (e^{it_1})^{6i(T-t_1)} = e^{i6t_1(T-t_1)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis:**\n   - The final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on both the original function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) from \\( 0 \\) to \\( t_1 \\) and the intervention \\( g(z) = z^3 \\) applied at \\( t_1 \\).\n   - Specifically, \\( z(T) \\) depends on the value of \\( z(t_1) \\), which is determined by the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) from \\( 0 \\) to \\( t_1 \\), and the transformation \\( g(z) \\) applied at \\( t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on the earlier application of \\( f(z) \\) through the intervention at \\( t_1 \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Behavior**:\n   - The initial function is \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which traces out the unit circle in the complex plane as \\( t \\) varies.\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), the function undergoes a transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\). This means that at \\( t = t_1 \\), the value of \\( z \\) becomes \\( z(t_1)^2 \\).\n\n2. **Intervention**:\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), the function \\( g(z) = z^3 \\) is applied as an intervention. This changes the state of the system to \\( z(t_1)^3 \\).\n   - From \\( t_1 \\) onwards, the function evolves according to \\( z(t) = e^{i(t-t_1)} \\cdot z(t_1)^3 \\).\n\n3. **Behavior After Intervention**:\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the function \\( z(t) \\) is now \\( z(t) = e^{i(t-t_1)} \\cdot z(t_1)^3 \\).\n   - The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on the value of \\( z(t_1)^3 \\), which itself depends on the earlier application of \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\).\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is influenced by both the initial behavior of \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) up to \\( t_1 \\) and the subsequent transformations \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\).\n   - Specifically, \\( z(T) = e^{i(T-t_1)} \\cdot (z(t_1)^2)^3 = e^{i(T-t_1)} \\cdot z(t_1)^6 \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does indeed depend on the earlier application of \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
