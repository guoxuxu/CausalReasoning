    "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine if we can precisely reconstruct the original form of \\( z(x, y) \\) from the transformation \\( T(r, s) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Transformation\nThe transformation \\( T(r, s) \\) is defined as:\n\\[ T(r, s) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{-i\\theta} z(r\\cos(\\theta), s\\sin(\\theta)) d\\theta \\]\nwhere \\( z(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( z(x, y) \\) into the Transformation\nFirst, substitute \\( z(x, y) \\) into the integral:\n\\[ T(r, s) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{-i\\theta} (r\\cos(\\theta))^2 + i(s\\sin(\\theta))^2 \\, d\\theta \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ T(r, s) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{-i\\theta} r^2 \\cos^2(\\theta) + i s^2 \\sin^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\]\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Integral\nWe can split the integral into real and imaginary parts:\n\\[ T(r, s) = r^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{-i\\theta} \\cos^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta + i s^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi} e^{-i\\theta} \\sin^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\]\n\nUsing Euler's formula, \\( e^{-i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) - i\\sin(\\theta) \\):\n\\[ T(r, s) = r^2 \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos(\\theta) \\cos^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta - i \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin(\\theta) \\cos^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\right) + i s^2 \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\cos(\\theta) \\sin^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta - i \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\sin(\\theta) \\sin^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\right) \\]\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Integral\nEach of these integrals can be evaluated using trigonometric identities and symmetry properties of sine and cosine over the interval \\([0, 2\\pi]\\). For instance, the integral of \\(\\cos(\\theta) \\sin^2(\\theta)\\) and similar terms will generally integrate to zero due to symmetry. The key terms that do not integrate to zero are those involving even powers of sine and cosine, which can be simplified using known results from Fourier analysis.\n\n### Step 5: Determine if Reconstruction is Possible\nFrom the above steps, it becomes clear that the integral will simplify in such a way that the real part will involve \\( r^2 \\) and the imaginary part will involve \\( s^2 \\). This suggests that \\( T(r, s) \\) retains information about both \\( r^2 \\) and \\( s^2 \\).\n\nHowever, the critical point is whether this transformation uniquely determines \\( z(x, y) \\).
