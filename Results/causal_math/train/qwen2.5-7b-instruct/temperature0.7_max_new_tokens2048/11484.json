However, since no information about \\( S \\) is provided, we assume only \\( T \\) is considered.\n   - Even with this assumption, knowing the final path does not uniquely determine the original path due to the nature of the transformation \\( T \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the above reasoning, it is not possible to precisely determine both the original path and whether \\( T \\) was applied solely based on the knowledge of the final path.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
