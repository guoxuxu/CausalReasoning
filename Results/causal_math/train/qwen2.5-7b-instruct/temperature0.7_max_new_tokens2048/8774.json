    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Differential Equation**:\n   - The given differential equation is \\(\\dot{z} = i\\omega z\\).\n   - This is a first-order linear differential equation.\n   - Its general solution is \\(z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\), where \\(z_0\\) is the initial condition at \\(t=0\\).\n\n2. **Integral Transform Definition**:\n   - The integral transform is defined as \\(f(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\omega s} z(s) ds\\).\n   - Substituting \\(z(s) = z_0 e^{i\\omega s}\\) into the integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     f(z)(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{i\\omega s} z_0 e^{i\\omega s} ds = z_0 \\int_{0}^{t} e^{2i\\omega s} ds\n     \\]\n   - Evaluating the integral, we have:\n     \\[\n     f(z)(t) = z_0 \\left[ \\frac{e^{2i\\omega t}}{2i\\omega} - \\frac{1}{2i\\omega} \\right] = z_0 \\left[ \\frac{e^{2i\\omega t} - 1}{2i\\omega} \\right]\n     \\]\n\n3. **Analyzing the Output of \\(f(z)\\)**:\n   - The expression for \\(f(z)(t)\\) depends only on \\(z_0\\) and \\(\\omega\\).\n   - Given \\(f(z)(T)\\), we can write:\n     \\[\n     f(z)(T) = z_0 \\left[ \\frac{e^{2i\\omega T} - 1}{2i\\omega} \\right]\n     \\]\n   - To determine \\(z_0\\), we need to isolate it from this equation.\n\n4. **Isolating \\(z_0\\)**:\n   - From the above equation, we can solve for \\(z_0\\) if we know \\(f(z)(T)\\), \\(\\omega\\), and \\(T\\):\n     \\[\n     z_0 = \\frac{2i\\omega f(z)(T)}{e^{2i\\omega T} - 1}\n     \\]\n   - This shows that given \\(f(z)(T)\\), \\(\\omega\\), and \\(T\\), we can indeed determine \\(z_0\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - With the knowledge of \\(f(z)(T)\\), \\(\\omega\\), and \\(T\\), we can trace back to the exact original state \\(z_0\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
