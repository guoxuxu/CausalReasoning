    "To determine if the transformed state \\(\\hat{u}(k,T)\\) at time \\(T\\) still satisfies the wave equation, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions and Fourier Transform**: The initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\) is Fourier transformed to obtain \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\). This transformation converts the spatial domain information into frequency domain information.\n\n2. **Wave Equation in Frequency Domain**: The wave equation in the original spatial domain is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   When we apply the Fourier transform with respect to \\(x\\), the wave equation transforms into:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{u}}{\\partial t^2} = -c^2 k^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(k\\) represents the wavenumber in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Evolution in Time**: Since the wave equation in the frequency domain is now a simple second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time, the solution for \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k,t) = \\hat{u}(k,0) \\cos(c k t) + \\frac{\\hat{v}(k,0)}{c k} \\sin(c k t)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\hat{v}(k,0)\\) is the Fourier transform of the first derivative of \\(u(x,0)\\) with respect to \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Final State at Time \\(T\\)**: At time \\(T\\), the transformed state is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k,T) = \\hat{u}(k,0) \\cos(c k T) + \\frac{\\hat{v}(k,0)}{c k} \\sin(c k T)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find \\(u(x,T)\\), we take the inverse Fourier transform of \\(\\hat{u}(k,T)\\):\n   \\[\n   u(x,T) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left[ \\hat{u}(k,T) \\right]\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verification of Wave Equation**: To check if \\(u(x,T)\\) still satisfies the wave equation, we need to verify that it satisfies:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   Since the Fourier transform and its inverse preserve the form of the wave equation, and the solution \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\) satisfies the transformed wave equation, the inverse Fourier transform of \\(\\hat{u}(k,T)\\) will also satisfy the original wave equation.\n\nTherefore, the transformed state \\(\\hat{u}(k,T)\\) at time \\(T\\) will indeed satisfy the wave equation.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions and Fourier Transform**: \n   - We start with the initial condition \\( u(x,0) \\).\n   - Applying the Fourier transform to \\( u(x,0) \\) gives us \\( \\hat{u}(k,0) \\).\n\n2. **Wave Equation Transformation**:\n   - The wave equation is given by \\( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\).\n   - When we apply the Fourier transform to both sides of this equation, we use the property that the Fourier transform of the second spatial derivative is equivalent to multiplying the Fourier transform of the function by \\( (ik)^2 \\) and the Fourier transform of the second time derivative is equivalent to multiplying by \\( (i\\omega)^2 \\).\n\n3. **Transformed Wave Equation**:\n   - The Fourier transform of the wave equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{u}}{\\partial t^2} = -c^2 k^2 \\hat{u}\n     \\]\n   - This is a simple ordinary differential equation in time for each \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Solving the Transformed Equation**:\n   - The solution to this ODE is:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{u}(k,t) = \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-i c^2 k^2 t}\n     \\]\n   - This shows that the Fourier transform of the solution \\( u(x,t) \\) evolves according to the same form as the original wave equation but in the frequency domain.\n\n5. **Final State at Time T**:\n   - At time \\( T \\), the Fourier transform of the state is:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{u}(k,T) = \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-i c^2 k^2 T}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:\n   - To get back to the spatial domain, we perform the inverse Fourier transform on \\( \\hat{u}(k,T) \\):\n     \\[\n     u(x,T) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k,T)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-i c^2 k^2 T}]\n     \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the Fourier transform of the wave equation preserves the form of the wave equation in the frequency domain, the transformed state \\( \\hat{u}(k,T) \\) will still satisfy the wave equation when transformed back to the spatial domain.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
