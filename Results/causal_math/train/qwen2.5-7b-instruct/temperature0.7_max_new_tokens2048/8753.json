If the sequence does diverge, then \\( c \\) is not in the Mandelbrot set.\n\n4. **Divergence Analysis**:\n   - For \\( z_0 = 0 \\), the first iteration gives \\( z_1 = c \\).\n   - The second iteration gives \\( z_2 = c^2 + c \\).\n   - Generally, \\( z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c \\).\n\n5. **Behavior of the Sequence**:\n   - If \\( |c| > 2 \\), the sequence will diverge.\n   - If \\( |c| \\leq 2 \\), the behavior is more complex but generally, the sequence may either remain bounded (if \\( c \\) is in the Mandelbrot set) or diverge (if \\( c \\) is outside the Mandelbrot set).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without specifying \\( c \\), we cannot definitively say whether the series will always diverge.

    "To determine if the series generated by iteratively applying the function \\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\) to an initial complex number \\( z_0 \\) will diverge without any additional intervention, we need to consider the properties of the Mandelbrot set and the behavior of such iterations.\n\n1. **Definition of the Iteration**: The iteration starts with \\( z_0 \\) and continues as follows:\n   \\[\n   z_{n+1} = f(z_n) = z_n^2 + c\n   \\]\n   for \\( n = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots \\).\n\n2. **Mandelbrot Set Condition**: A point \\( c \\) belongs to the Mandelbrot set if the sequence \\( \\{z_n\\} \\) remains bounded (i.e., does not diverge to infinity). If the sequence diverges for a particular \\( c \\), then \\( c \\) is not in the Mandelbrot set.\n\n3. **Behavior Analysis**:\n   - For some values of \\( c \\) and initial \\( z_0 \\), the sequence \\( \\{z_n\\} \\) may indeed diverge.\n   - However, for certain values of \\( c \\) (specifically those within the Mandelbrot set), the sequence \\( \\{z_n\\} \\) will remain bounded, even if the initial value \\( z_0 \\) is chosen arbitrarily.\n\n4. **Divergence Without Intervention**: The question asks whether the series will diverge without any additional intervention. This implies that no external control or stopping condition is applied to halt the iteration if it starts to diverge.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While there exist values of \\( c \\) and initial \\( z_0 \\) for which the sequence will diverge, there also exist values (specifically those within the Mandelbrot set) for which the sequence will not diverge.
