Applying this transformation to \\( u(x,t) \\):\n   \\[\n   g(u) = e^{\\lambda t}u\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( g(u) \\) into the heat equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial (e^{\\lambda t}u)}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 (e^{\\lambda t}u)}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left-hand side:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial (e^{\\lambda t}u)}{\\partial t} = e^{\\lambda t} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\lambda e^{\\lambda t} u\n   \\]\n   And the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   k \\frac{\\partial^2 (e^{\\lambda t}u)}{\\partial x^2} = k e^{\\lambda t} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   So the transformed equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\lambda t} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\lambda e^{\\lambda t} u = k e^{\\lambda t} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by \\( e^{\\lambda t} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\lambda u = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   This shows that the transformation does not change the fundamental form of the heat equation but adds a term involving \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n3. **Transformation 2**: The second transformation is given by \\( h(u) = e^{\\mu t}u \\). Applying this transformation to \\( u(x,t) \\):\n   \\[\n   h(u) = e^{\\mu t}u\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( h(u) \\) into the transformed heat equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial (e^{\\mu t}u)}{\\partial t} + \\lambda e^{\\mu t} u = k \\frac{\\partial^2 (e^{\\mu t}u)}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left-hand side:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial (e^{\\mu t}u)}{\\partial t} = e^{\\mu t} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\mu e^{\\mu t} u\n   \\]\n   And the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   k \\frac{\\partial^2 (e^{\\mu t}u)}{\\partial x^2} = k e^{\\mu t} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   So the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\mu t} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\mu e^{\\mu t} u + \\lambda e^{\\mu t} u = k e^{\\mu t} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by \\( e^{\\mu t} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + (\\mu + \\lambda) u = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   Again, this transformation adds a term involving \\( \\mu + \\lambda \\).\n\n4. **Final Form at Time \\( T \\)**: At time \\( T \\), the function \\( u(x,T) \\) will be affected by both transformations. The presence of \\( \\mu \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) indicates that these transformations introduce additional terms into the heat equation, meaning the solution at time \\( T \\) will depend on both \\( k \\), \\( \\mu \\), and \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nTherefore, the final form of \\( u(x,T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is not solely determined by the initial heat equation parameter \\( k \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation**: The function \\( u(x,t) \\) initially satisfies the heat equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   We then apply the transformation \\( g(u) = e^{\\lambda t} u \\).
