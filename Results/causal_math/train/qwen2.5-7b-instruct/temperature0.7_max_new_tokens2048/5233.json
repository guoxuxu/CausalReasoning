    "To determine whether the state of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) will be the same after applying the linear transformation \\( M \\) to the initial conditions \\((x_0, y_0)\\) compared to evolving the initial conditions directly under the given differential equation, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions and Transformation:**\n   - Initial conditions: \\( (x_0, y_0) \\)\n   - Linear transformation matrix: \\( M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n   - Transformed initial conditions: \\( (x_1, y_1) = M \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax_0 + by_0 \\\\ cx_0 + dy_0 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\n2. **Differential Equation:**\n   - The given PDE is \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + k z = 0 \\).\n   - This can be solved using the method of separation of variables or by recognizing it as a first-order linear PDE.\n   - The general solution for \\( z(t) \\) is \\( z(t) = A e^{-kt} \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n3. **Evolving the Transformed Initial Conditions:**\n   - For the transformed initial conditions \\( (x_1, y_1) \\), the initial value of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) is \\( z(0) = x_1 + iy_1 = (ax_0 + by_0) + i(cx_0 + dy_0) \\).\n   - Under the differential equation, the solution is \\( z(t) = (ax_0 + by_0 + i(cx_0 + dy_0)) e^{-kt} \\).\n\n4. **Direct Evolution of Initial Conditions:**\n   - For the original initial conditions \\( (x_0, y_0) \\), the initial value of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) is \\( z(0) = x_0 + iy_0 \\).\n   - Under the differential equation, the solution is \\( z(t) = (x_0 + iy_0) e^{-kt} \\).\n\n5. **Comparison at \\( t = T \\):**\n   - Transformed initial condition evolution: \\( z(T) = (ax_0 + by_0 + i(cx_0 + dy_0)) e^{-kT} \\)\n   - Direct evolution: \\( z(T) = (x_0 + iy_0) e^{-kT} \\)\n\nFor the states to be the same at \\( t = T \\):\n\\[ (ax_0 + by_0 + i(cx_0 + dy_0)) e^{-kT} = (x_0 + iy_0) e^{-kT} \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ ax_0 + by_0 + i(cx_0 + dy_0) = x_0 + iy_0 \\]\n\nFor this equality to hold for all \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\), the coefficients must match:\n\\[ a = 1, b = 0, c = 0, d = 1 \\]\nwhich means the matrix \\( M \\) must be the identity matrix.\n\nSince the problem does not specify that \\( M \\) is the identity matrix, the states will generally not be the same unless \\( M \\) is the identity matrix.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether applying a linear transformation \\( M \\) to the initial conditions \\((x_0, y_0)\\) at \\( t = 0 \\) results in the same state of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) as evolving the initial conditions directly under the given differential equation, we need to analyze the transformation and the evolution process step-by-step.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions and Transformation:**\n   - Let the initial conditions be \\((x_0, y_0)\\).\n   - Applying the transformation \\( M \\) gives us:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = M \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\\\ y_0 \\end{pmatrix}\n     \\]\n   - This results in new initial conditions \\((x', y')\\).\n\n2. **Evolution Under Differential Equation:**\n   - The differential equation governing \\( z(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + k z = 0\n     \\]\n   - The solution to this differential equation is:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = e^{-kt} z(0)\n     \\]\n   - For the transformed initial conditions, the evolution is:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = e^{-kt} \\left( a x_0 + b y_0 \\right) + i \\left( c x_0 + d y_0 \\right)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Direct Evolution of Initial Conditions:**\n   - If the initial conditions \\((x_0, y_0)\\) are directly evolved, the solution is:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = e^{-kt} \\left( x_0 + i y_0 \\right)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Comparison at Time \\( T \\):**\n   - For the transformed initial conditions:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{-kT} \\left( a x_0 + b y_0 \\right) + i \\left( c x_0 + d y_0 \\right)\n     \\]\n   - For the direct evolution:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{-kT} \\left( x_0 + i y_0 \\right)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - These two expressions are not generally equal unless \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = 0 \\), and \\( d = 1 \\). In other words, the transformation \\( M \\) changes the initial conditions in a way that does not preserve the form of the solution to the differential equation.\n\nTherefore, the state of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) after applying the transformation \\( M \\) is not the same as if the initial conditions had been directly evolved under the same differential equation.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
