This implies that the system changes its behavior from \\( e^z \\) to \\( e^{Cz} \\).\n\n4. **Post-Intervention Dynamics**: After \\( t_1 \\), the new evolution of \\( z \\) would be influenced by both \\( A \\) and \\( C \\). However, we need to consider the effect of the intervention on the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\).\n\n5. **Endpoint Calculation**:\n   - From \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = t_1 \\), \\( z(t) \\) evolves as \\( z(t) = z(0)e^{At} \\).\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), the state of \\( z \\) is \\( z(t_1) = z(0)e^{At_1} \\).\n   - From \\( t = t_1 \\) to \\( t = T \\), the intervention \\( g(z) = e^{Cz} \\) modifies the dynamics. Assuming the intervention directly modifies the exponential term, the new evolution can be approximated as \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\) (since \\( e^{Cz} \\) suggests a linear transformation in the exponent).\n\n6. **New Dynamics Post-Intervention**:\n   - The solution to \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\) is \\( z(t) = z(t_1)e^{C(t-t_1)} \\) for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\).\n   - Therefore, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = z(t_1)e^{C(T-t_1)} = z(0)e^{At_1}e^{C(T-t_1)}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) through the terms \\( e^{At_1} \\) and \\( e^{C(T-t_1)} \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) does indeed depend on both \\( A \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Dynamics**: We start with the function \\( f(z) = e^z \\).

However, this intervention does not directly change the dynamics of \\( z \\). Instead, it transforms the state of \\( z \\) at \\( t_1 \\). The transformed state can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(t_1) = z(0)e^{At_1}e^{Cz(t_1)}\n   \\]\n   But since we are considering the effect of \\( g(z) \\) on \\( z \\) at \\( t_1 \\), we need to focus on how \\( z \\) evolves after \\( t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Post-Intervention Dynamics**: After \\( t_1 \\), the dynamics continue as \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\). So, from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\) (where \\( T > t_1 \\)), the evolution of \\( z \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(t_1)e^{A(t-t_1)} \\quad \\text{for } t_1 < t \\leq T\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**: To determine if the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( C \\), we need to evaluate \\( z(T) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z(t_1)e^{A(T-t_1)}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( z(t_1) \\) itself already incorporates the effect of the initial condition and the dynamics up to \\( t_1 \\), any transformation due to \\( g(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) is already factored into \\( z(t_1) \\). Therefore, the subsequent evolution from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\) depends solely on \\( A \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) indeed depends only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( C \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
