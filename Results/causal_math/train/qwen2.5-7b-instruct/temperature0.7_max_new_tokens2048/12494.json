This means the new input function becomes \\( e^{Bt}x(t) \\).\n\nSubstituting this into the original integral equation, we get:\n\\[ y(T) = \\int_0^T e^{-sA}(e^{Bs}x(s)) \\, ds \\]\n\\[ y(T) = \\int_0^T e^{(B-A)s}x(s) \\, ds \\]\n\nThis shows that the transformed input function \\( e^{Bt}x(t) \\) results in a modified integral kernel \\( e^{(B-A)s} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Introducing the Additional Transformation \\( U(x) \\)\nAt time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( U(x) = e^{Ct}x(t) \\) is applied. This implies that from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, the input function becomes \\( e^{Ct}x(t) \\).\n\nThe combined effect of both transformations can be written as:\n\\[ y(T) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{(B-A)s}x(s) \\, ds + \\int_{t_1}^T e^{(B-A)s}e^{C(s-t_1)}x(s) \\, ds \\]\n\\[ y(T) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{(B-A)s}x(s) \\, ds + \\int_{t_1}^T e^{(B-A)s}e^{Cs- Ct_1}x(s) \\, ds \\]\n\\[ y(T) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{(B-A)s}x(s) \\, ds + e^{Ct_1}\\int_{t_1}^T e^{(B-A+C)s}x(s) \\, ds \\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Dependence on Matrix \\( A \\)\nFrom the expression above, we see that the output \\( y(T) \\) involves two parts:\n1.
