Without knowing the exact form of \\( h(t) \\), we cannot isolate \\( y(T) \\) from \\( z(T) \\) alone.\n   - The value of \\( z(T) \\) depends on the entire history of \\( y(t) \\) up to \\( t = T \\) and the filter characteristics \\( h(t) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given only \\( z(T) \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( y(T) \\) because the convolution process mixes multiple past values of \\( y(t) \\) and the filter \\( h(t) \\) in a way that does not allow for a unique inverse transformation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
