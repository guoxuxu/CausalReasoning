Since \\(T\\) only adds a term to the interior of the domain, it does not affect the boundary values directly unless the cosine term happens to match the boundary conditions in a specific way, which is unlikely given the general nature of boundary conditions.\n\nGiven these points, if we know \\(u(x, t)\\) and recognize that it includes the term \\(c \\cos(x)\\), we can indeed subtract \\(c \\cos(x)\\) to get back to \\(u(x)\\).
