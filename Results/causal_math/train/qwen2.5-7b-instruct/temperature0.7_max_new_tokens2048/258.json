    "Let's break down the problem to determine if we can reconstruct the matrix \\(A\\) accurately from the Laplace transform \\(L(w)(s)\\) of the function \\(w(z) = e^{Az}\\).\n\n1. **Understand the Function and Transform:**\n   - The function is \\(w(z) = e^{Az}\\), where \\(z\\) is a complex number and \\(A\\) is a complex matrix.\n   - Applying the Laplace transform to \\(w(z)\\) gives us \\(L(w)(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{Az} e^{-sz} dz\\).\n\n2. **Properties of the Laplace Transform:**\n   - The Laplace transform of \\(e^{Az}\\) is known to be \\(\\frac{1}{s - A}\\) for appropriate conditions (specifically, when the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) have negative real parts).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform:**\n   - If we know \\(L(w)(s)\\), we can write it as \\(L(w)(s) = \\frac{1}{s - A}\\).\n   - Taking the inverse Laplace transform would ideally allow us to recover \\(e^{Az}\\).
