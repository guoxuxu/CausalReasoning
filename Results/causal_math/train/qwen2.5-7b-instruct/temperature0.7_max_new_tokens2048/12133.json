This means if \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\), then \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t - a)\\} = e^{-as}F(s) \\).\n\n5. **Application to Our Problem**: If \\( H(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( h(t) \\), then:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t - a)\\} = e^{-as}H(s)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, applying the inverse Laplace transform to \\( H'(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   h'(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H'(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{e^{-as}H(s)\\} = h(t - a)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the above steps, the modification by \\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\) directly results in a time-shifted version of \\( h(t) \\) in the time domain, specifically \\( h(t - a) \\).\n\nTherefore, we can definitively confirm that the modification by \\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\) was responsible for the observed shift in \\( h(t) \\) to \\( h(t - a) \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a function \\( h(t) \\) and its Laplace transform \\( H(s) \\).\n\n2. **Modification by \\( G(s) \\)**: The function \\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\) is introduced. When multiplied with \\( H(s) \\), it modifies \\( H(s) \\) to \\( H(s) \\cdot G(s) = H(s) \\cdot e^{-as} \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform of \\( H(s) \\cdot e^{-as} \\) gives us a new function in the time domain, which we'll call \\( h_1(t) \\).\n\n4. **Effect of \\( e^{-as} \\)**: The term \\( e^{-as} \\) in the Laplace domain corresponds to a time-shifting property in the time domain. Specifically, multiplying by \\( e^{-as} \\) in the Laplace domain results in shifting the time-domain function \\( h(t) \\) to the right by \\( a \\) units.\n\n5. **Resulting Function**: Therefore, \\( h_1(t) = h(t-a) \\).\n\n6. **Observation**: If we observe a shift in \\( h(t) \\) to \\( h(t-a) \\), this directly corresponds to the effect of multiplying \\( H(s) \\) by \\( e^{-as} \\).\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that if we observe a shift in \\( h(t) \\) to \\( h(t-a) \\), then it is indeed due to the modification by \\( G(s) = e^{-as} \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
