It simply maps the values of \\(z(t)\\) to a new set of values.\n\n3. **Observing \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t=T\\)**:\n   If we observe \\(z(T)\\), we can use the solution form to express it as:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{pT}z_0 + \\frac{q}{p}(e^{pT} - 1)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Effect of Transformation**:\n   If \\(g(z) = z^k\\) was applied, then the observed value would actually be \\(z(T)^k\\).
