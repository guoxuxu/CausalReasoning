For simplicity, assume \\( A \\) is such that it commutes with \\( i\\omega \\) (which is often true for many matrices in linear algebra problems of this nature).\n   - If \\( A \\) commutes with \\( i\\omega \\), then we can write:\n     \\[\n     e^{sA} e^{i\\omega s} = e^{s(A + i\\omega I)}.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the integral becomes:\n     \\[\n     T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{s(A + i\\omega I)} ds.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Exponential**:\n   - The integral can be simplified using the property of exponentials:\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^t e^{s(A + i\\omega I)} ds = \\left[ \\frac{e^{s(A + i\\omega I)}}{A + i\\omega I} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{e^{t(A + i\\omega I)} - I}{A + i\\omega I}.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Transforming at Time \\( T \\)**:\n   - At time \\( T \\), the transformed function is:\n     \\[\n     T[z](T) = \\frac{e^{T(A + i\\omega I)} - I}{A + i\\omega I}.\n     \\]\n\n6. **Comparing with Original Function**:\n   - The original function at time \\( T \\) is:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{i\\omega T}.\n     \\]\n   - For \\( T[z](T) \\) to be the same as \\( z(T) \\), we would need:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{e^{T(A + i\\omega I)} - I}{A + i\\omega I} = e^{i\\omega T}.\n     \\]\n   - This equality holds if and only if the matrix \\( A \\) is such that \\( e^{TA} = I \\), meaning \\( A = 0 \\) (since the matrix exponential of zero is the identity matrix).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Generally, \\( A \\neq 0 \\), so the equality does not hold in most cases.
