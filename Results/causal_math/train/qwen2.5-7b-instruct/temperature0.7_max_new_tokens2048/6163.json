    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**: The given differential equation is \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 - 2x + 1\\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\(g(x) = x + k\\)**: This transformation shifts the value of \\(x\\) by a constant \\(k\\). If we apply \\(g(x)\\) to the differential equation, it changes the state variable from \\(x\\) to \\(y = x + k\\). Thus, the new differential equation in terms of \\(y\\) would be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dy}{dt} = (y - k)^2 - 2(y - k) + 1\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dy}{dt} = y^2 - 2ky + k^2 - 2y + 2k + 1 = y^2 - 2(k+1)y + (k^2 + 2k + 1)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transformation \\(h(x) = x - k\\)**: This is the inverse transformation of \\(g(x)\\), shifting the value back by \\(k\\). When this transformation is applied after the first one, it essentially undoes the shift caused by \\(g(x)\\).\n\n4. **Impact on Endpoint \\(x(T)\\)**: The endpoint \\(x(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) depends on the initial conditions and the solution of the differential equation over the interval \\([t_1, T]\\). Since \\(h(x)\\) is simply reversing the effect of \\(g(x)\\), the overall effect of applying both transformations \\(g(x)\\) and then \\(h(x)\\) is equivalent to not applying any transformation at all. Therefore, the endpoint \\(x(T)\\) should be the same as if no transformation had been applied.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The endpoint \\(x(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will not depend on the value of \\(k\\) because the transformations \\(g(x)\\) and \\(h(x)\\) cancel each other out.
