This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\hat{u}(t, k) + a i k \\hat{u}(t, k) = 0.\n   \\]\n   This is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time for each fixed \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt} \\hat{u}(t, k) = -a i k \\hat{u}(t, k).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solution to the ODE**: The solution to this ODE is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(t, k) = \\hat{u}(0, k) e^{-a i k t}.\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{u}(t, k)\\) evolves over time with a phase factor \\(e^{-a i k t}\\).\n\n5. **Recovering Initial Condition**: At time \\(T\\), the Fourier transform is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(T, k) = \\hat{u}(0, k) e^{-a i k T}.\n   \\]\n   To find \\(\\hat{u}(0, k)\\), we need to isolate it from \\(\\hat{u}(T, k)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(0, k) = \\hat{u}(T, k) e^{a i k T}.\n   \\]\n   This means that knowing \\(\\hat{u}(T, k)\\) allows us to directly compute \\(\\hat{u}(0, k)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is that we can indeed recover the initial condition \\(\\mathcal{F}[u(0, x)]\\) from \\(\\mathcal{F}[u(T, x)]\\) using the relationship derived above.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE**: The given PDE \\(u_t + a u_x = 0\\) describes a wave propagating with speed \\(a\\) in the positive \\(x\\)-direction.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)]\\) converts the spatial variable \\(x\\) into frequency space. For a function \\(u(t, x)\\), the Fourier transform in \\(x\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[u(t, x)] = \\hat{u}(t, k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(t, x) e^{-ikx} dx\n   \\]\n   where \\(k\\) is the wavenumber.\n\n3. **Evolution in Frequency Space**: Applying the Fourier transform to the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[u_t] + a \\mathcal{F}[u_x] = 0\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Fourier transform, this becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\hat{u}(t, k) - ika \\hat{u}(t, k) = 0\n   \\]\n   This is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time for each \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}\\hat{u}(t, k) = ika \\hat{u}(t, k)\n   \\]\n   The solution to this ODE is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(t, k) = \\hat{u}(0, k) e^{ika t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Recovering Initial Condition**: From the above, we see that the Fourier transform at time \\(T\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(T, k) = \\hat{u}(0, k) e^{ika T}\n   \\]\n   To find \\(\\hat{u}(0, k)\\), we would need to solve for \\(\\hat{u}(0, k)\\) from \\(\\hat{u}(T, k)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(0, k) = \\hat{u}(T, k) e^{-ika T}\n   \\]\n   This shows that knowing \\(\\mathcal{F}[u(T, x)]\\) allows us to directly compute \\(\\mathcal{F}[u(0, x)]\\) without needing any additional information about the spatial evolution or initial spatial conditions.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Yes, given \\(\\mathcal{F}[u(T, x)]\\), we can recover \\(\\mathcal{F}[u(0, x)]\\) using the relationship derived above.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
