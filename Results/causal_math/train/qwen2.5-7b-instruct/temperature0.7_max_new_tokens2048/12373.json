    "Let's break down the problem and analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation and Domain**: The given PDE is the Laplace equation \\( u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 \\). This equation describes a harmonic function \\( u(x, y) \\) defined over a domain \\( D \\).\n\n2. **Boundary Condition**: The boundary condition is \\( u = f \\) on \\( \\partial D \\). This means that the value of the function \\( u \\) on the boundary of the domain \\( D \\) is given by the function \\( f \\).\n\n3. **Eigenfunction Expansions**: The solution to the Laplace equation with the given boundary conditions can often be expressed as an eigenfunction expansion.
