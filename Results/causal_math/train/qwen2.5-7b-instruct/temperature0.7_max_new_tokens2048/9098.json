    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original system dynamics are given by:\n   \\[ \\dot{x} = Dx + u \\]\n   \n2. A transformation \\( h(x) = Qx \\) is applied, which changes the state representation but not the underlying dynamics of the system.\n\n3. If the transformation \\( h(x) = Qx \\) is applied, the new state variables \\( y \\) would be related to the original state \\( x \\) by:\n   \\[ y = Qx \\]\n\n4. To determine if the original state \\( x_0 \\) can be found without knowing whether \\( h(x) \\) was applied, we need to consider two scenarios:\n   - Scenario 1: Transformation \\( h(x) \\) was applied.\n   - Scenario 2: Transformation \\( h(x) \\) was not applied.\n\n5. In Scenario 1, the state at time \\( t = T \\) would be \\( y(T) \\), and we know that \\( y(T) = Qx(T) \\).\n\n6. In Scenario 2, the state at time \\( t = T \\) would simply be \\( x(T) \\).\n\n7.

This transformation changes the state vector \\(x(t)\\) to \\(Qx(t)\\).\n\n3. **Effect of Transformation**: When the transformation \\(h(x) = Qx\\) is applied, the dynamics of the system change to \\(\\dot{y} = D' y + u'\\), where \\(y = Qx\\).
