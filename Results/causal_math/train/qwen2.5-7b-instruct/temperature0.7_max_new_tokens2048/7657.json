  "Problem": "Consider a system where the output \\\\( z \\\\) is given by the Fourier transform of a function \\\\( h(t) \\\\), applied to an input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\). Assume that the Fourier transform pair is represented by \\\\( X(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( x(t) \\\\) and \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) for \\\\( h(t) \\\\), and the resulting output in the frequency domain is \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) X(\\\\omega) \\\\).\n\nIf the input signal \\\\( x(t) \\\\) at \\\\( t = 0 \\\\) is a delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) and no intervention is applied, will the output \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) \\\\) be equivalent to \\\\( H(\\\\omega) \\\\) without any modifications?",
  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The delta function \\\\( \\\\delta(t) \\\\) has a Fourier transform that is a constant across frequencies. Thus, \\\\( X(\\\\omega) = 1 \\\\) for all \\\\( \\\\omega \\\\). The output then naturally becomes \\\\( Z(\\\\omega) = H(\\\\omega) \\\\times 1 = H(\\\\omega) \\\\), which implies that without any modification, the output will just reflect the frequency response of the system defined by \\\\( h(t) \\\\).",
