    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have two functions \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) with their respective Laplace transforms \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\). The product of these transforms in the s-domain is given as \\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\).\n\n2. **Convolution Theorem**: According to the Convolution Theorem, if we take the inverse Laplace transform of the product \\( H(s) \\), it corresponds to the convolution of \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   h(t) = (f * g)(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} f(\\tau)g(t-\\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   where \\( h(t) \\) is the result of the convolution.\n\n3. **Inverse Transform**: Given \\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\), the inverse Laplace transform of \\( H(s) \\) gives us:\n   \\[\n   h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)G(s)\\}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform is not unique. This means that different pairs of functions \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) could yield the same \\( H(s) \\). For example, if \\( f(t) = e^{-at}u(t) \\) and \\( g(t) = u(t) \\), then their Laplace transforms would be \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s+a} \\) and \\( G(s) = \\frac{1}{s} \\), respectively, and their product \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s(s+a)} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without additional constraints or information about the specific forms of \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\), we cannot uniquely determine both functions from just \\( H(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform and Convolution**: \n   - The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is given by \\( F(s) = L\\{f(t)\\} \\).\n   - If two functions \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) are convolved, their Laplace transforms multiply in the s-domain: \\( L\\{f(t) * g(t)\\} = F(s)G(s) \\), where \\( * \\) denotes convolution.\n\n2. **Given Information**:\n   - We know \\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\), which is the product of the Laplace transforms of \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\).\n\n3. **Question Analysis**:\n   - The question asks if we can uniquely determine \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) from \\( H(s) \\) alone.\n   - Uniqueness means that there should be no other pair of functions \\( f'(t) \\) and \\( g'(t) \\) such that \\( L\\{f'(t) * g'(t)\\} = H(s) \\) unless \\( f'(t) = f(t) \\) and \\( g'(t) = g(t) \\).\n\n4. **Reasoning**:\n   - In general, the inverse Laplace transform of \\( H(s) \\) does not uniquely determine the original functions \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\). This is because the convolution theorem only tells us about the relationship between the transforms but does not specify the unique pairs of functions that produce a given \\( H(s) \\).\n   - For example, if \\( f(t) = e^{-t}u(t) \\) (where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function) and \\( g(t) = e^{-t}u(t) \\), then \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+1)^2} \\). However, if \\( f(t) = 2e^{-t}u(t) \\) and \\( g(t) = \\frac{1}{2}e^{-t}u(t) \\), we still have \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+1)^2} \\), showing that multiple pairs of functions can lead to the same \\( H(s) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without additional constraints or information, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) from \\( H(s) \\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
