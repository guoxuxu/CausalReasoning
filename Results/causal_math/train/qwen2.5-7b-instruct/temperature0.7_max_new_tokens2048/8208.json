  "Explanation": "Both h(z) and g(z) are complex operations that can result in changes to the input of f which are difficult to reverse engineer uniquely. The exponential function and squaring of complex numbers can lead to multiple possible pre-images, making it impossible to definitely ascertain the interventions used just from the output.",
