    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Equation**:\n   The PDE given is \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = -i\\nabla^2 z \\). This is a linear partial differential equation that describes how the function \\( z(t) \\) changes over time. Here, \\( \\nabla^2 \\) is the Laplacian operator in two dimensions, which means it involves second derivatives with respect to \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Initial Condition**:\n   The initial condition for \\( z(t) \\) is given as \\( z(0) = e^{ax+by} \\). This is a specific form of the function at \\( t=0 \\).\n\n3. **Evolution of the Function**:\n   According to the PDE, the function \\( z(t) \\) evolves over time. Since the equation is linear and homogeneous (no external forcing terms), the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) will be determined solely by the initial condition and the given PDE.\n\n4. **Solution Form**:\n   The solution to such equations often takes the form of an eigenfunction expansion or can sometimes be found through separation of variables if applicable. However, for the initial condition \\( z(0) = e^{ax+by} \\), we need to consider if this form remains consistent with the evolution described by the PDE.\n\n5. **Consistency Check**:\n   For the function \\( z(t) \\) to remain consistent with the given PDE, it must satisfy both the initial condition and the PDE throughout its evolution. The form \\( e^{ax+by} \\) does not change under the Laplacian operator because the Laplacian of a linear function of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) is zero. Therefore, the initial condition itself is a solution to the PDE when \\( t=0 \\).\n\n6. **General Solution**:\n   The general solution to the PDE can be expressed as a superposition of solutions of the form \\( e^{kx + ly}e^{-i(k^2 + l^2)t} \\), where \\( k \\) and \\( l \\) are constants related to the modes of the Laplacian. The initial condition \\( e^{ax+by} \\) can be decomposed into such modes, and each mode will evolve independently according to the PDE.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   Since the evolution is governed by the given PDE and the initial condition is consistent with this evolution, the function \\( z(t) \\) at any later time \\( T \\) will indeed reflect only the effects of the original PDE without any additional interventions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
