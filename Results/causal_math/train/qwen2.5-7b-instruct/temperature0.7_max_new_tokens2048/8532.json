    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The given PDE \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\) describes how temperature \\( u \\) changes over time due to heat conduction. Here, \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity constant.\n\n2. **Initial Condition**: The initial condition is \\( u(x, 0) = \\phi(x) \\), meaning the initial temperature distribution along the spatial domain is known.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform to the heat equation, we get an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time for \\( \\hat{u}(s, t) \\), the Fourier transform of \\( u(x, t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k s^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   Solving this ODE with the initial condition \\( \\hat{u}(s, 0) \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(s, t) = \\hat{u}(s, 0) e^{-k s^2 t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Thermal Diffusivity Change**: Suppose the thermal diffusivity \\( k \\) changes to \\( k' \\) at some unknown time \\( t_1 \\). This would change the ODE to two parts:\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\): \\( \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k s^2 \\hat{u} \\)\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\): \\( \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k' s^2 \\hat{u} \\)\n\n5. **Solution Form**: The solution can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(s, t) = \n   \\begin{cases} \n   \\hat{u}(s, 0) e^{-k s^2 t_1} e^{-k s^2 (t - t_1)} & \\text{for } t < t_1 \\\\\n   \\hat{u}(s, 0) e^{-k s^2 t_1} e^{-k' s^2 (t - t_1)} & \\text{for } t \\geq t_1 \n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determining \\( t_1 \\)**: To determine \\( t_1 \\) from \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\), we need to compare the solutions for \\( t < t_1 \\) and \\( t \\geq t_1 \\). However, without additional information such as the exact form of \\( \\hat{u}(s, 0) \\) or specific values of \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( t_1 \\) just from \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclusively determine the time \\( t_1 \\) at which the thermal diffusivity changed.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
