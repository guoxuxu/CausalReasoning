Without knowing the exact form of \\(u(x, t_1)\\), it is not possible to fully predict the state of the system at any future time \\(T\\).\n\n- **Effect of Fourier Transform**: While the Fourier transform provides a useful tool for solving certain types of PDEs (like those with constant coefficients), the specific values of the function in the spatial domain at \\(t = t_1\\) (after the inverse Fourier transform) are necessary to propagate the solution forward.\n\nGiven these considerations, the knowledge of \\(L\\) alone is insufficient to predict the state of the system at \\(t = T\\) without also knowing the initial conditions after the inverse Fourier transform.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
