    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We start with \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant complex frequency.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i \\omega' t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i \\omega t} e^{-i \\omega' t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i (\\omega - \\omega') t} dt\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Result of Fourier Transform**: For the Fourier transform to yield a non-zero value, the integral must converge. However, for the general case of \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), the Fourier transform will be a Dirac delta function:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\omega') = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\n   \\]\n   This indicates that if \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\neq 0 \\), then \\( \\omega' \\) must equal \\( \\omega \\). \n\n4. **Implication of Non-Zero Value**: If \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\) is non-zero at a specific \\( \\omega' \\), it implies that \\( \\omega' \\) is equal to \\( \\omega \\).\n\n5. **Original Function**: Given that \\( \\omega' = \\omega \\), the original function \\( z(t) \\) would indeed be \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) (or more precisely, a scaled version of it, but no additional phase or amplitude adjustments were mentioned).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since \\( \\omega' \\) directly corresponds to \\( \\omega \\) from the Fourier transform result, we can deduce that the original function \\( z(t) \\) was exactly \\( e^{i \\omega' t} \\) without any additional phase or amplitude adjustments.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a complex constant.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i \\omega t} e^{-i \\omega' t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i (\\omega - \\omega') t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral does not converge for most values of \\( \\omega - \\omega' \\) due to the unbounded nature of the exponential function over the entire real line.

If \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\neq 0 \\), then \\( \\omega = \\omega' \\).\n\n5. **Phase and Amplitude Consideration**: However, the Fourier transform only provides information about the frequency content and does not capture phase shifts or amplitude changes in the original time-domain signal. Therefore, knowing \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega') \\neq 0 \\) at a specific \\( \\omega' \\) tells us that the original function had a frequency component at \\( \\omega' \\), but it doesn't specify the exact form of the function (e.g., it could have been \\( e^{i \\omega' t} \\) with some phase shift or amplitude change).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given only the Fourier transform result and no additional information about the original function's phase or amplitude, we cannot conclusively state that the original function was exactly \\( e^{i \\omega' t} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
