    "To determine if the solution obtained through the Laplace Transform (L) and Inverse Laplace Transform (L⁻¹) will precisely match the original solution of the ODE, let's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Applying the Laplace Transform (L):**\n   - The given ODE is \\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\).\n   - Applying the Laplace Transform to each term:\n     - \\( L[y''] = s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) \\)\n     - \\( L[y'] = sY(s) - y(0) \\)\n     - \\( L[y] = Y(s) \\)\n   - Substituting these into the ODE gives us an algebraic equation in terms of \\( Y(s) \\), the Laplace transform of \\( y(t) \\).\n\n2. **Solving the Algebraic Equation:**\n   - We solve the resulting algebraic equation for \\( Y(s) \\).
