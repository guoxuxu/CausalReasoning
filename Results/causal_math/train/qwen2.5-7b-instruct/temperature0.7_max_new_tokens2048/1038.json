    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral Transform**: The given function \\(u(z)\\) is an integral transform of \\(f(t)\\).

However, adding \\(h(t)\\) to \\(f(t)\\) before transforming means that the inverse transform will not be able to distinguish between \\(f(t)\\) and \\(f(t) + h(t)\\) because both will result in the same \\(u(z)\\) plus their respective transforms.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about \\(h(t)\\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\(f(t)\\) from \\(u(z)\\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
