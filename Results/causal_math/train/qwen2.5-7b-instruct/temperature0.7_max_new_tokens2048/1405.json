    "To determine if the integral \\( F(z) = \\int_{0}^{z} e^t dt \\) is path-independent for a straight path from 0 to \\( z \\), we need to analyze the properties of the integrand and the fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals.\n\n1. **Identify the Integrand**: The integrand here is \\( e^t \\), which is an entire function (holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane).\n\n2. **Path Independence for Holomorphic Functions**: A key property of holomorphic functions is that their integrals over closed paths are zero. More specifically, for any two points \\( z_1 \\) and \\( z_2 \\) in the domain of a holomorphic function, the integral from \\( z_1 \\) to \\( z_2 \\) depends only on the endpoints and not on the path taken. This follows from the Cauchy-Goursat theorem and the fact that holomorphic functions have primitives.\n\n3. **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals**: For a holomorphic function \\( f(z) \\), the integral \\( \\int_{\\gamma} f(z) dz \\) where \\( \\gamma \\) is a path from \\( z_1 \\) to \\( z_2 \\) can be evaluated as \\( F(z_2) - F(z_1) \\) where \\( F(z) \\) is a primitive (antiderivative) of \\( f(z) \\).
