Therefore, knowing \\(w(z)\\) allows us to determine \\(C\\) because it's explicitly present in the expression for \\(w(z)\\).\n\n6. **Determine \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)**: The values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not directly observable from \\(w(z)\\) alone. They are part of the exponential term \\(e^{Az + B\\overline{z}}\\), which encapsulates their combined effect. Without additional information (such as the behavior of \\(w(z)\\) at different points or specific values of \\(z\\)), \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) cannot be uniquely determined from \\(w(z)\\) alone.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: We can determine the value of \\(C\\) from \\(w(z)\\), but we cannot determine the values of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) based solely on the observation of \\(w(z)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
