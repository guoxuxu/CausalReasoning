    "To determine if we can deduce the original transformation parameter from the output function \\( g(z) \\), let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Transformation**: The original integral is \\( g(z) = \\int_{C} \\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\).

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral Transformation**:\n   The given integral is \\( g(z) = \\int_{C} \\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\), where \\( w \\) is inside the contour \\( C \\). This is a Cauchy integral, and its value depends on the residue at the singularity \\( z = w \\).\n\n2. **Residue Calculation**:\n   For the integral \\( \\int_{C} \\frac{e^{az}}{z - w} dz \\), the residue at \\( z = w \\) is \\( e^{aw} \\).
