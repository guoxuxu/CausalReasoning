This introduces an additional phase factor \\( e^{i\\theta t_1} \\) to the function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\).\n\n3. **State at \\( t_1^+ \\)**: After applying the transformation \\( g(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\), the function becomes \\( z(t_1^+) = e^{i\\theta t_1}z(t_1) \\). Here, \\( z(t_1) \\) is already transformed by \\( e^{i\\omega t_1} \\), so the combined effect up to \\( t_1 \\) is \\( z(t_1) = e^{i\\omega t_1}u(t_1) + i e^{i\\omega t_1}v(t_1) \\).\n\n4. **Further Evolution from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\)**: For \\( t > t_1 \\), the function continues to evolve according to the original transformation \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z(t) \\). Therefore, from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\), the function evolves as:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} e^{i\\theta t_1} z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( z(t_1) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} e^{i\\theta t_1} \\left( e^{i\\omega t_1} u(t_1) + i e^{i\\omega t_1} v(t_1) \\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i\\omega (T - t_1) + i\\theta t_1} \\left( e^{i\\omega t_1} u(t_1) + i e^{i\\omega t_1} v(t_1) \\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i(\\omega T + (\\theta - \\omega) t_1)} \\left( u(t_1) + i v(t_1) \\right)\n   \\]\n\nFrom the above expression, it is clear that the ultimate state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does not solely depend on the initial transformation by \\( \\omega \\) but also includes the effect of \\( \\theta \\) through the term \\( e^{i(\\theta - \\omega) t_1} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
