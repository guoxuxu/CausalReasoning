The integral transformation introduces a new state vector at \\( t = T \\) which is a function of all previous states up to \\( t = T \\). This new state cannot be equivalent to the original state unless the transformation \\( f(z) \\) is trivial (i.e., \\( C = 0 \\)), which would imply no change.\n\nTherefore, the function \\( z(T) \\) will not be the same as if the integral transformation \\( f(z) \\) was not applied, because the integral transformation fundamentally changes the state of the system by integrating the weighted values over time.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
