    "To determine if the trajectory of \\( w(t) \\) for \\( t > 0 \\) will be a scaled version of \\( z(t) \\) without further alteration, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: At \\( t = 0 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   z(0) = e^{i\\omega \\cdot 0} = 1\n   \\]\n   So, initially, both \\( z(t) \\) and \\( w(t) \\) are the same, i.e., \\( w(0) = Mz(0) = M \\cdot 1 = M \\).\n\n2. **Time Evolution**:\n   - The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n   - The transformed function is \\( w(t) = Mz(t) = M e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n3. **Analysis of Transformation**:\n   - Since \\( M \\) affects the amplitude and frequency, it can be represented as a matrix that modifies the complex exponential function.\n   - For simplicity, assume \\( M \\) scales the magnitude (amplitude) but does not alter the frequency. This means \\( M \\) can be written as \\( |M|e^{i\\phi} \\) where \\( |M| \\) is the scaling factor and \\( \\phi \\) is the phase shift.\n   - Therefore, \\( w(t) = |M|e^{i\\phi} e^{i\\omega t} = |M|e^{i(\\omega t + \\phi)} \\).\n\n4. **Trajectory Comparison**:\n   - The trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), which lies on the unit circle in the complex plane.\n   - The trajectory of \\( w(t) \\) is \\( |M|e^{i(\\omega t + \\phi)} \\), which also lies on a circle of radius \\( |M| \\) in the complex plane.\n   - The phase shift \\( \\phi \\) and the scaling factor \\( |M| \\) do not change the fact that \\( w(t) \\) is still a scaled version of \\( z(t) \\) in terms of its trajectory.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The trajectory of \\( w(t) \\) for \\( t > 0 \\) will indeed be a scaled version of \\( z(t) \\) because the transformation \\( w(t) = Mz(t) \\) scales the amplitude but does not change the fundamental periodic nature of the exponential function.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). This represents a complex exponential function, which describes a circular motion in the complex plane with angular frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\n2. **Transformation by Matrix \\( M \\)**: The transformation is given by \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\). Here, \\( M \\) is a matrix that can affect both the amplitude and frequency of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Evaluate at \\( t = 0 \\)**: At \\( t = 0 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   z(0) = e^{i\\omega \\cdot 0} = e^0 = 1\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   w(0) = M \\cdot z(0) = M \\cdot 1 = M\n   \\]\n\n4. **Time-Evolution**: For \\( t > 0 \\), the function \\( z(t) \\) evolves as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). If \\( w(t) \\) is a scaled and possibly phase-shifted version of \\( z(t) \\), it should take the form:\n   \\[\n   w(t) = A e^{i(\\omega' t + \\phi)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( A \\) is the scaling factor (amplitude), \\(\\omega'\\) is the new angular frequency, and \\(\\phi\\) is the phase shift.\n\n5. **Matrix Transformation Analysis**: The matrix \\( M \\) can be represented in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Suppose \\( M \\) has eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) corresponding to eigenvectors \\( v_1 \\) and \\( v_2 \\). Then, \\( M \\) can be diagonalized as:\n   \\[\n   M = PDP^{-1}\n   \\]\n   where \\( D \\) is the diagonal matrix with \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\) on the diagonal, and \\( P \\) is the matrix of eigenvectors.\n\n6. **Applying \\( M \\) to \\( z(t) \\)**: When applying \\( M \\) to \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   w(t) = M z(t) = PDP^{-1} e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( z(t) \\) is a vector in the complex plane, we need to consider how \\( M \\) acts on this vector. If \\( z(t) \\) is a unit vector (as in our case, since \\( |z(t)| = 1 \\)), then the transformation \\( M \\) scales and rotates this vector.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The transformation \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\) will generally scale and rotate \\( z(t) \\). It does not simply scale \\( z(t) \\) without further alteration because the rotation part of the transformation cannot be ignored. Therefore, the trajectory of \\( w(t) \\) for \\( t > 0 \\) will not be a scaled version of \\( z(t) \\) without further alteration.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the trajectory of \\( w(t) \\) for \\( t > 0 \\) will be a scaled version of \\( z(t) \\) without further alteration, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Transformation**: The transformation applied to \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\).\n\n2. **Original Function Definition**: The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n3. **Transformation Application**: Applying the transformation, we get \\( w(t) = M e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n4. **Matrix \\( M \\)**: Since \\( M \\) is a matrix that can affect both the amplitude and frequency, it can be decomposed into a product of a scaling factor and a rotation factor. For simplicity, assume \\( M \\) can be represented as \\( M = S \\cdot R \\), where \\( S \\) scales the amplitude and \\( R \\) rotates the phase.\n\n5. **Effect on \\( z(t) \\)**: When applying \\( M \\) to \\( z(t) \\):\n   - The scaling part \\( S \\) will change the magnitude (amplitude) of \\( z(t) \\).\n   - The rotation part \\( R \\) will change the phase of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n6. **Trajectory Analysis**: The trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) is a circle in the complex plane with radius 1 and angular velocity \\( \\omega \\). The transformation \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\) will scale the radius of this circle and possibly change its angular velocity, but it will not introduce any additional non-linearities or alterations beyond scaling and rotating the original circle.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The trajectory of \\( w(t) \\) for \\( t > 0 \\) will indeed be a scaled version of \\( z(t) \\) because the transformation only scales the amplitude and rotates the phase. There is no indication from the given information that any other form of alteration would occur.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
