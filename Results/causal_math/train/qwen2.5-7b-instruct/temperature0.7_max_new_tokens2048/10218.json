    "To determine if we can infer the original function \\( f(z) \\) around the contour \\( C \\) from the modified integral result, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Original Integral**:\n   The original integral is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\oint_C \\frac{dz}{z-a}\n   \\]\n   According to the Cauchy integral formula, for a closed contour \\( C \\) around a point \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   \\oint_C \\frac{dz}{z-a} = 2\\pi i\n   \\]\n\n2. **Modified Integral**:\n   The modified integral is:\n   \\[\n   \\oint_C \\frac{e^{z^2}}{z-a} dz\n   \\]\n   This integral is not directly solvable using elementary methods without more specific information about the contour \\( C \\) and the behavior of \\( e^{z^2} \\).\n\n3. **Transformation Analysis**:\n   We need to consider the transformations mentioned:\n   - \\( f(z) \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{z-a} \\)\n   - \\( f(z) \\rightarrow \\frac{e^{z^2}}{z-a} \\)\n\n   In both cases, the function \\( \\frac{1}{z-a} \\) and \\( \\frac{e^{z^2}}{z-a} \\) are being integrated over the same contour \\( C \\).\n\n4. **Inference of Original Function**:\n   To infer the original function \\( f(z) \\) from the modified integral, we would need additional information about how the transformation affects the integral result. However, based solely on the given transformations and the integral results, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( f(z) \\). Both transformations involve integrating \\( \\frac{1}{z-a} \\) and \\( \\frac{e^{z^2}}{z-a} \\) respectively, but the specific form of \\( f(z) \\) before the transformation is not recoverable just from these integrals alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
