    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: The system involves an integral transformation using the Laplace Transform, where \\(Y(s)\\) is the Laplace transform of \\(y(t)\\). The convolution with \\(h(t) = e^{-at}\\) in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by \\(H(s) = \\frac{1}{s+a}\\) in the Laplace domain.\n\n2. **Effect of Convolution**: When the system is modified through convolution with \\(h(t)\\), the Laplace transform of the resulting function (let's call it \\(z(t)\\)) will be:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = Y(s) \\cdot H(s) = Y(s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s+a}\n   \\]\n   This means that in the Laplace domain, the effect of the convolution is to divide \\(Y(s)\\) by \\(s+a\\).\n\n3. **Reversing the Operation**: To determine if we can definitively conclude \\(y(t)\\) from \\(Z(s)\\), we need to reverse the operation.
