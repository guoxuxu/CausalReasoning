First, let's find \\( z(0) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(0) = e^{i \\cdot 0} = \\cos(0) + i\\sin(0) = 1 + 0i = 1.\n   \\]\n   Applying \\( f(z) \\) to \\( z(0) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(z(0)) = 1^2 = 1.\n   \\]\n   However, this does not provide enough information to conclude whether \\( f(z) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) specifically, because there could be other points in time where \\( z(t) = -1 \\) and then \\( f(z) \\) could have been applied.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Without additional information about the sequence of events (i.e., when exactly \\( f(z) \\) was applied), we cannot definitively determine if \\( f(z) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) based solely on the given data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function \\( z(t) \\):**\n   - The function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) describes a point on the unit circle in the complex plane as \\( t \\) (time) varies.\n   - At \\( t = \\pi \\), \\( z(\\pi) = e^{i\\pi} = -1 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( f(z) \\):**\n   - The function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) squares the complex number \\( z \\).\n   - If \\( z(\\pi) = -1 \\), then applying \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = \\pi \\) gives \\( f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Determining Application of \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\):**\n   - We need to check if \\( f(z) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) without intervention.\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), \\( z(0) = e^{i \\cdot 0} = 1 \\).\n   - Applying \\( f(z) \\) to \\( z(0) = 1 \\) gives \\( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Checking Consistency:**\n   - We know that \\( z(\\pi) = -1 \\) and \\( f(z) \\) transforms it to 1.\n   - However, the initial value at \\( t = 0 \\) is \\( z(0) = 1 \\), which under \\( f(z) \\) also results in 1.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the transformation \\( f(z) \\) applied to \\( z(0) = 1 \\) results in 1, and there is no indication of any other intervention, we can infer that \\( f(z) \\) was indeed applied at \\( t = 0 \\) without any additional changes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function \\( z(t) \\):**\n   - The function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) describes a unit circle in the complex plane as \\( t \\) (time) varies over the real numbers.\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), \\( z(0) = e^{i \\cdot 0} = 1 \\).\n   - At \\( t = \\pi \\), \\( z(\\pi) = e^{i \\pi} = -1 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( f(z) \\):**\n   - The function \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) squares the complex number \\( z \\).\n   - If \\( z(\\pi) = -1 \\), then applying \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = \\pi \\) gives \\( f(z(\\pi)) = (-1)^2 = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Determine if \\( f(z) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\):**\n   - We know that \\( z(\\pi) = -1 \\) after applying \\( f(z) \\).\n   - To find out if \\( f(z) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\), we need to trace back from \\( z(\\pi) = -1 \\).\n   - Since \\( f(z) = z^2 \\), the square root of \\( -1 \\) is \\( \\pm i \\). This means \\( z(0) \\) could have been \\( i \\) or \\( -i \\).\n\n4. **Initial Condition at \\( t = 0 \\):**\n   - From \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), at \\( t = 0 \\), \\( z(0) = 1 \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( z(0) \\) cannot be \\( i \\) or \\( -i \\) based on the initial condition.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \\( z(0) = 1 \\) and not \\( i \\) or \\( -i \\), it implies that \\( f(z) \\) was not applied at \\( t = 0 \\) because the transformation would have changed the initial value from 1 to either \\( i \\) or \\( -i \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
