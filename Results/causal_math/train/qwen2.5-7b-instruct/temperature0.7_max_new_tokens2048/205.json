    "To determine if the state \\(x(t)\\) at time \\(T\\) depends only on the matrix \\(D\\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **System Dynamics**: The system dynamics are described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Dx + Cu\\), where \\(C\\) is the control input matrix and \\(u(t) = e^{Et}u_0\\) is the control input applied to the system.\n\n2. **Control Input**: The control input \\(u(t)\\) is given as \\(u(t) = e^{Et}u_0\\).
