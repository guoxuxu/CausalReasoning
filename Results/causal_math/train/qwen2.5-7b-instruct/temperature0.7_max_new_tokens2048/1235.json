    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the complex function \\( f(z) = z^2 + c \\), where \\( c \\) is a fixed complex constant. We also have an external transformation \\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\), which rotates \\( z \\) by an angle \\( \\theta \\).\n\n2. **Iteration Without Transformation**:\n   - The sequence generated by iterating \\( f(z) \\) without any transformation would be:\n     \\[\n     z_0, z_1 = f(z_0) = z_0^2 + c, z_2 = f(z_1) = (z_0^2 + c)^2 + c, \\ldots\n     \\]\n   - The boundedness of this sequence depends on the value of \\( c \\).

Therefore, the magnitude of \\( z_n \\) in the transformed sequence is the same as in the original sequence.\n   - The rotation merely changes the direction of the complex numbers in the complex plane but does not alter their magnitudes.\n\n5. **Boundedness Consideration**:\n   - Since the magnitudes of the terms in the sequence do not change due to the rotation, the boundedness property of the sequence is preserved. If the original sequence was bounded, it will remain bounded after applying the transformation because the magnitudes of the terms remain the same.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The nature of the boundedness of the sequence does not change with the application of the external transformation \\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\). The boundedness is determined by the dynamics of the function \\( f(z) \\) itself, and the rotation does not introduce any unbounded growth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
