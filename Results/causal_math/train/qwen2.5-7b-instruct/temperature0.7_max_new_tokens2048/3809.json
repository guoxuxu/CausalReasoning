For the Laplace transform to converge, \\(y(t)\\) must go to zero faster than \\(e^{st}\\) as \\(t \\to \\infty\\). Thus, the first term vanishes at infinity, leaving us with:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} \\frac{dy(t)}{dt} dt = s \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} y(t) dt\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substituting the Laplace Transform**: Recognize that \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} y(t) dt\\) is just the definition of \\(Y(s)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} \\frac{dy(t)}{dt} dt = sY(s)\n   \\]\n\n7. **Considering Initial Conditions**: If there is an initial condition \\(y(0)\\), it would appear as a constant term in the expression. However, the standard form of the Laplace transform of the derivative includes this initial condition as well:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{Dy(t)\\} = sY(s) - y(0)\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the Laplace transform of the derivative \\(Dy(t)\\) is indeed \\(sY(s) - y(0)\\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
