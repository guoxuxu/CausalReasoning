    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the governing equation**:\n   The evolution of the velocity field \\(v(x, t)\\) is governed by the Navier-Stokes equation with an additional external force term:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 v + F(x, t)\n   \\]\n   Given that \\(F(x, t) = e^{Mt}x\\), this means we have a specific form for the external force.\n\n2. **Final observation at time T**:\n   We know the state of the system at a final time \\(T\\), i.e., \\(v(x, T)\\). This is our only information about the system at that point in time.\n\n3. **Identifying the force(s)**:\n   To determine whether the force \\(F(x, t)\\) was applied, we need to consider the influence of the force on the velocity field over time. Since the force term \\(F(x, t) = e^{Mt}x\\) depends on time through the exponential factor, its effect will be integrated into the velocity field over the interval from \\(t=0\\) to \\(T\\).\n\n4. **Inverse problem**:\n   The inverse problem here would be to deduce the history of the force from the final state of the velocity field. However, without knowing the initial conditions and other parameters (like viscosity \\(\\nu\\) and the pressure field \\(p\\)), it is challenging to uniquely identify the exact form of the force \\(F(x, t)\\) from just the final observation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Given that the force \\(F(x, t)\\) is time-dependent and its effect is integrated into the velocity field over time, it is not straightforward to uniquely identify the applied force based solely on the final observation at time \\(T\\). There could be multiple scenarios (including the application of another force \\(G(x, t)\\)) that could lead to the same final state \\(v(x, T)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
