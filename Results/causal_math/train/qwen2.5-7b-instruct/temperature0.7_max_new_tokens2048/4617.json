  "Problem": "Consider a complex function Z, where Z(s) = integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) * cos(t) dt.

  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The operation G derived from the function's definition and the properties of Laplace transforms results in the same transformed function regardless of when it is applied, given no further transformations are involved. The nature of G(Z) being purely based on s makes it invariant to the timing relative to the initial transformation.",
