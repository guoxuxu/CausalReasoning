    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: We start with \\( z(x) = e^{Ax + B} \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are matrices.\n2. **Additional Transformation**: An additional linear transformation represented by matrix \\( C \\) is applied to \\( z(x) \\). This results in a new function \\( z'(x) = Cz(x) = Ce^{Ax + B} \\).\n3. **Fourier Transformation**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(x) \\) is given by \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\). The Fourier transform of \\( z'(x) \\) is \\( \\hat{z}'(\\omega) \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the effect of applying the linear transformation \\( C \\) on the Fourier transform:\n\n4. **Effect of Linear Transformation on Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of a product of a matrix and a function can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{Ce^{Ax + B}\\}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} Ce^{Ax + B} e^{-i\\omega x} dx\n   \\]\n5. **Simplification**: Since \\( C \\) is a constant matrix, it can be factored out of the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{Ce^{Ax + B}\\}(\\omega) = C \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{Ax + B} e^{-i\\omega x} dx\n   \\]\n6. **Fourier Transform of Original Function**: The Fourier transform of \\( e^{Ax + B} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{Ax + B}\\}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{Ax + B} e^{-i\\omega x} dx\n   \\]\n7. **Independence of \\( B \\)**: Notice that the term \\( e^B \\) is a constant matrix (since \\( B \\) is a constant matrix) and does not depend on \\( x \\). Therefore, it can be factored out of the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{Ax + B}\\}(\\omega) = e^B \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{Ax} e^{-i\\omega x} dx\n   \\]\n8. **Conclusion**: The Fourier transform \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\) of \\( z(x) = e^{Ax + B} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\omega) = e^B \\hat{z}_A(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\hat{z}_A(\\omega) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( e^{Ax} \\).\n\nWhen we apply the linear transformation \\( C \\), the Fourier transform becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}'(\\omega) = C e^B \\hat{z}_A(\\omega)\n   \\]\n\nThe factor \\( e^B \\) is still present, but it is multiplied by \\( C \\). Therefore, the resulting Fourier transform \\( \\hat{z}'(\\omega) \\) is not independent of \\( B \\).\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
