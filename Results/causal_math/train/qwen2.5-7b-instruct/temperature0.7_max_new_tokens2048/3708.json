This provides information about the degree of the polynomial used to transform \\( g(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, knowing \\( H(s) \\), we can uniquely identify the original function being multiplied by \\( t^2 \\) rather than any other polynomial or operation because each polynomial will produce a distinct form when transformed through the Laplace transform.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can uniquely identify that the original function \\( g(t) \\) was multiplied by \\( t^2 \\) based on the Laplace transform \\( H(s) \\) after the transformation, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. **Laplace Transform of \\( g(t) \\)**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is given by \\( G(s) = L[g(t)] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}g(t) dt \\).\n\n2. **Transformation to \\( h(t) \\)**:\n   - The new function \\( h(t) \\) is defined as \\( h(t) = t^2 g(t) \\).\n   - We need to find the Laplace transform of \\( h(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     H(s) = L[h(t)] = L[t^2 g(t)].\n     \\]\n   - Using the property of the Laplace transform for multiplication by \\( t^n \\), we know that:\n     \\[\n     L[t^n f(t)] = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} F(s),\n     \\]\n     where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\). For \\( n = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     L[t^2 g(t)] = -\\frac{d^2}{ds^2} G(s).\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( H(s) = -\\frac{d^2}{ds^2} G(s) \\).\n\n3. **Identifying the Original Function**:\n   - Given \\( H(s) \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     H(s) = -\\frac{d^2}{ds^2} G(s).\n     \\]\n   - To uniquely identify that \\( g(t) \\) was multiplied by \\( t^2 \\), we would need to reverse this process and check if the only function \\( g(t) \\) that satisfies this relationship is the one that was originally multiplied by \\( t^2 \\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness Analysis**:\n   - Suppose there exists another function \\( k(t) \\) such that when transformed by \\( t^2 \\), it also results in \\( H(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     L[t^2 k(t)] = -\\frac{d^2}{ds^2} K(s) = H(s).\n     \\]\n   - This implies:\n     \\[\n     K(s) = -\\frac{d^2}{ds^2} H(s).\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( H(s) = -\\frac{d^2}{ds^2} G(s) \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     K(s) = G(s).\n     \\]\n   - This means:\n     \\[\n     k(t) = g(t).\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the only function \\( g(t) \\) that satisfies the condition is indeed \\( g(t) \\) itself, multiplied by \\( t^2 \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can conclude that given the Laplace transform \\( H(s) \\), we can uniquely identify that the original function was multiplied by \\( t^2 \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
