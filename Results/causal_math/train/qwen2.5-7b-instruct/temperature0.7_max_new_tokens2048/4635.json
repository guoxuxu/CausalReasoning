    "Let's analyze the given differential equation and the Fourier transform step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Differential Equation\nThe differential equation is:\n\\[ \\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\omega z + k \\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. The general solution can be found using the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor is \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\). Multiplying both sides by this factor gives:\n\\[ e^{i\\omega t} \\frac{dz}{dt} + i\\omega e^{i\\omega t} z = k e^{i\\omega t} \\]\n\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of \\( z(t) e^{i\\omega t} \\):\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} (z(t) e^{i\\omega t}) = k e^{i\\omega t} \\]\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to \\( t \\):\n\\[ z(t) e^{i\\omega t} = \\int k e^{i\\omega t} dt + C \\]\n\\[ z(t) e^{i\\omega t} = \\frac{k}{i\\omega} e^{i\\omega t} + C \\]\n\\[ z(t) = \\frac{k}{i\\omega} + C e^{-i\\omega t} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply Initial Conditions\nTo find the constant \\( C \\), we need an initial condition. Let's assume \\( z(0) = z_0 \\):\n\\[ z_0 = \\frac{k}{i\\omega} + C \\]\n\\[ C = z_0 - \\frac{k}{i\\omega} \\]\n\nThus, the solution becomes:\n\\[ z(t) = \\frac{k}{i\\omega} + \\left(z_0 - \\frac{k}{i\\omega}\\right) e^{-i\\omega t} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Fourier Transform Before Intervention\nThe Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) before any intervention is:\n\\[ F(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{k}{i\\omega} + \\left(z_0 - \\frac{k}{i\\omega}\\right) e^{-i\\omega t} \\right) e^{-i\\omega' t} dt \\]\n\\[ F(\\omega') = \\frac{k}{i\\omega} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i(\\omega' + \\omega) t} dt + \\left(z_0 - \\frac{k}{i\\omega}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i(\\omega' - \\omega) t} dt \\]\n\nBoth integrals are Dirac delta functions:\n\\[ F(\\omega') = \\frac{k}{i\\omega} \\delta(\\omega' + \\omega) + \\left(z_0 - \\frac{k}{i\\omega}\\right) \\delta(\\omega' - \\omega) \\]\n\n### Step 4: Introduce the Intervention\nAt time \\( t_1 \\), \\( k \\) changes to \\( k' \\). This means for \\( t > t_1 \\), the new solution is:\n\\[ z(t) = \\frac{k'}{i\\omega} + \\left(z_0 - \\frac{k'}{i\\omega}\\right) e^{-i\\omega t} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Fourier Transform After Intervention\nThe Fourier transform of the new \\( z(t) \\) after \\( t_1 \\) is:\n\\[ F(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t_1} \\left( \\frac{k}{i\\omega} + \\left(z_0 - \\frac{k}{i\\omega}\\right) e^{-i\\omega t} \\right) e^{-i\\omega' t} dt + \\int_{t_1}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{k'}{i\\omega} + \\left(z_0 - \\frac{k'}{i\\omega}\\right) e^{-i\\omega t} \\right) e^{-i\\omega' t} dt \\]\n\nFor large \\( t \\), the exponential term \\( e^{-i\\omega t} \\) decays rapidly, so the main contribution comes from the region around \\( t_1 \\). The Fourier transform will effectively \"switch\" between the contributions of \\( k \\) and \\( k' \\) at \\( t_1 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega) \\) after the intervention does not simply depend solely on the new parameter \\( k' \\) but also retains information about the initial \\( k \\) through the initial conditions and the switching point \\( t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
