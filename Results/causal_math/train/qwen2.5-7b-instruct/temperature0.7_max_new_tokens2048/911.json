    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine if \\(X_{new}(T)\\) depends solely on the initial kernel \\(K(s, t)\\) and not on the transformations applied.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Original Process\nThe original process is defined as:\n\\[ X(s) = \\int_0^s K(s, t) Y(t) dt \\]\nwhere \\(Y(t)\\) is a Brownian motion process, and \\(K(s, t)\\) is a deterministic kernel function.\n\n### Step 2: Applying the First Transformation\nThe first transformation modifies the kernel as follows:\n\\[ K_{new}(s, t) = e^{At} K(s, t) \\]\nApplying this to the integral, we get:\n\\[ X_{new1}(s) = \\int_0^s e^{At} K(s, t) Y(t) dt \\]\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Second Transformation\nThe second transformation further modifies the kernel at a specific time \\(t_1\\):\n\\[ K_{int}(s, t) = e^{Bt} K(s, t) \\]\nThis transformation is only applied for \\(t \\geq t_1\\). Therefore, the modified kernel can be written as:\n\\[ K_{new2}(s, t) = \n\\begin{cases} \ne^{At} K(s, t) & \\text{if } t < t_1 \\\\\ne^{At} e^{Bt} K(s, t) & \\text{if } t \\geq t_1 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThus, the new integral becomes:\n\\[ X_{new2}(s) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{At} K(s, t) Y(t) dt + \\int_{t_1}^s e^{A t} e^{B t} K(s, t) Y(t) dt \\]\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating \\(X_{new2}(T)\\)\nWe need to evaluate \\(X_{new2}(T)\\) at \\(s = T\\):\n\\[ X_{new2}(T) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{At} K(T, t) Y(t) dt + \\int_{t_1}^T e^{A t} e^{B t} K(T, t) Y(t) dt \\]\n\n### Step 5: Dependence Analysis\nFrom the expression above, it is clear that \\(X_{new2}(T)\\) depends on both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) through the exponential terms \\(e^{At}\\) and \\(e^{Bt}\\).
