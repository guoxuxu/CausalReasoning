    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **System Description**: The system has a transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\).\n\n2. **Disturbance Introduction**: A disturbance \\( d(t) = e^{\\lambda t} \\) is introduced into the system at \\( t = 0 \\). This means that the input to the system is now \\( d(t) \\) instead of the usual zero input (assuming no external input other than the disturbance).\n\n3. **Output Calculation**: To find the output \\( z(t) \\) in the presence of the disturbance, we need to consider the Laplace transform of the disturbance and then apply the transfer function \\( H(s) \\).\n\n4. **Laplace Transform of Disturbance**: The Laplace transform of \\( d(t) = e^{\\lambda t} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   D(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{\\lambda t}\\} = \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Output in Frequency Domain**: Using the transfer function \\( H(s) \\), the output in the frequency domain \\( Z(s) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = H(s) \\cdot D(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{s}{(s^2 + s + 1)(s - \\lambda)}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Output**: To determine if the final output \\( z(t) \\) at a later time \\( t \\) is solely governed by the original transfer function \\( H(s) \\) without the inclusion of \\( \\lambda \\), we need to consider the effect of \\( \\lambda \\) on the output.\n\n7. **Effect of \\( \\lambda \\)**: The term \\( \\lambda \\) introduces a non-zero disturbance that affects the output. Therefore, the final output \\( z(t) \\) will not be solely governed by \\( H(s) \\) but will also include the influence of \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the final output \\( z(t) \\) at a later time \\( t \\) is influenced by both the transfer function \\( H(s) \\) and the disturbance parameter \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the final output \\( z(t) \\) at a later time \\( t \\) will be solely governed by the original transfer function \\( H(s) \\) without the inclusion of \\( \\lambda \\), we need to analyze how the disturbance \\( d(t) = e^{\\lambda t} \\) affects the system.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Transfer Function and Laplace Transform:**\n   - The transfer function \\( H(s) \\) relates the Laplace transform of the input to the Laplace transform of the output.\n   - Given \\( H(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of Disturbance:**\n   - The disturbance function \\( d(t) = e^{\\lambda t} \\) has a Laplace transform:\n     \\[\n     D(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{\\lambda t}\\} = \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Output in the Frequency Domain:**\n   - The output \\( Z(s) \\) in the frequency domain can be found using the transfer function and the Laplace transform of the disturbance:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = H(s) \\cdot D(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\frac{s}{(s^2 + s + 1)(s - \\lambda)}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform:**\n   - To find the time-domain response \\( z(t) \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( Z(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     z(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{s}{(s^2 + s + 1)(s - \\lambda)} \\right\\}\n     \\]\n   - This involves partial fraction decomposition and then applying the inverse Laplace transform.\n\n5. **Effect of \\( \\lambda \\):**\n   - The presence of \\( \\lambda \\) in the denominator indicates that the disturbance \\( e^{\\lambda t} \\) directly influences the form of \\( z(t) \\).\n   - Therefore, the final output \\( z(t) \\) will not be solely governed by the original transfer function \\( H(s) \\) but will also include the effect of \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe final output \\( z(t) \\) at a later time \\( t \\) will indeed include the effect of \\( \\lambda \\) due to the disturbance \\( d(t) = e^{\\lambda t} \\).
