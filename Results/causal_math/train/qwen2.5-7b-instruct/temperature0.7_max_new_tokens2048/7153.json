    "To determine whether the inverse Fourier transform will retrieve the original function \\(z(t)\\) as it would develop under the initial differential equation, let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Differential Equation**: We have the differential equation \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = iAz\\).
