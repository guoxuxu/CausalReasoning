    "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform \\( F(p) \\) of a function \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(p) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-pt} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral maps the time-domain function \\( z(t) \\) to the frequency domain.\n\n2. **Sudden Change in \\( z(t) \\)**: A sudden change in \\( z(t) \\) would imply a discontinuity in \\( z(t) \\). Discontinuities in the time domain correspond to impulses (Dirac delta functions) in the frequency domain. Specifically, if \\( z(t) \\) has a sudden change at \\( t = t_0 \\), then \\( z(t) \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z_1 u(t - t_0) + z_2 u(t - t_0)^c\n   \\]\n   where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function, and \\( z_1 \\) and \\( z_2 \\) are the values just before and after the discontinuity, respectively. The term \\( u(t - t_0)^c \\) represents the complementary unit step function.\n\n3. **Impulse Response in Frequency Domain**: The Laplace transform of a Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(t - t_0) \\) is \\( e^{-t_0 p} \\). Therefore, the Laplace transform of the sudden change at \\( t = t_0 \\) would include an impulse at \\( p \\cdot t_0 \\).\n\n4. **Determining the Time of Sudden Change**: While the Laplace transform \\( F(p) \\) does contain information about the presence of impulses, it does not directly provide the time \\( t_0 \\) at which the sudden change occurred. The location of the impulse in the frequency domain only gives us \\( t_0 p \\), but not \\( t_0 \\) itself without additional information.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without knowing the specific form of \\( F(p) \\) or having some additional information about the nature of \\( z(t) \\) (such as its known behavior around the time of the change), we cannot unequivocally determine the exact time \\( t_0 \\) at which the sudden change occurred.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

In the frequency domain, such a discontinuity would appear as high-frequency components or a broad spectrum.\n\n4. **Information Loss in Transformation**: The process of taking the Laplace transform involves integration, which smooths out rapid changes and loses information about the exact times of these changes.
