    "To determine if the final phase shift of the output voltage \\(v(t)\\) at time \\(T\\) (where \\(T > t_1\\)) will be independent of the initial input frequency \\(\\omega\\), let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Circuit Analysis**:\n   - The input voltage \\(u(t) = U_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\).\n   - The impedance of the resistor \\(R\\) is purely resistive and does not affect the phase.\n   - The impedance of the capacitor \\(C\\) is \\(X_C = \\frac{1}{i\\omega C} = -i\\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\).\n\n2. **Output Voltage Across Capacitor**:\n   - The voltage across the capacitor \\(v(t)\\) can be found using the impedance of the capacitor.\n   - Using Ohm's law in the frequency domain, the output voltage \\(V(s)\\) (Laplace transform of \\(v(t)\\)) is given by:\n     \\[\n     V(s) = \\frac{U_0}{R + X_C} = \\frac{U_0}{R - i\\frac{1}{\\omega C}}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     V(s) = \\frac{U_0}{R - i\\frac{1}{\\omega C}} = \\frac{U_0 (R + i\\frac{1}{\\omega C})}{R^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\right)^2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Phase Shift Due to Capacitor**:\n   - The phase shift introduced by the capacitor is \\(-90^\\circ\\) because the imaginary part is negative.\n   - The overall phase shift at the input frequency \\(\\omega\\) is thus \\(-90^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Effect of Filter**:\n   - A filter that adjusts the phase shift by \\(\\phi\\) degrees at time \\(t_1\\) introduces an additional phase shift \\(\\phi\\) at that point.\n   - This phase shift will affect the output voltage starting from \\(t_1\\).\n\n5. **Final Phase Shift at Time \\(T\\)**:\n   - For \\(T > t_1\\), the phase shift at \\(T\\) will include both the inherent \\(-90^\\circ\\) phase shift due to the capacitor and the additional phase shift \\(\\phi\\) introduced by the filter.\n   - The total phase shift at \\(T\\) is \\(-90^\\circ + \\phi\\).\n\n6. **Independence from Initial Input Frequency \\(\\omega\\)**:\n   - The phase shift introduced by the capacitor is independent of \\(\\omega\\).\n   - The additional phase shift \\(\\phi\\) introduced by the filter is also independent of \\(\\omega\\).\n\nTherefore, the final phase shift of the output voltage at time \\(T\\) will indeed be independent of the initial input frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
