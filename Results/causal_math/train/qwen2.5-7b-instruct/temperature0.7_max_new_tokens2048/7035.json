However, this modification does not change the underlying dynamics defined by \\(A\\); it only transforms the state vector itself.\n\n3. **Intervention with Operator \\(U(z)\\)**: An intervention is introduced at time \\(t_1\\) using the operator \\(U(z) = e^{Ct}z(t)\\). This means that from time \\(t_1\\) onwards, the state vector \\(z(t)\\) is further modified by the exponential of matrix \\(C\\).\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**:\n    - Before \\(t_1\\): The state \\(z(t)\\) evolves as \\(z(t) = e^{iAt}z(0)\\).\n    - At \\(t_1\\): The state is transformed by \\(U(z(t_1)) = e^{Ct_1}z(t_1) = e^{Ct_1}e^{iAt_1}z(0)\\).\n    - From \\(t_1\\) to \\(T\\): The state continues to evolve under the influence of \\(A\\), but now it is also influenced by the transformation due to \\(C\\).
