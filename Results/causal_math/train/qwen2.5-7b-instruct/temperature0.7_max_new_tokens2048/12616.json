    "To determine if \\(H(g(z))\\) at some later time T will be equivalent to \\(H(h(z))\\), let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a function \\(g(z) = e^{iw}z\\), where \\(w\\) is a complex constant. This function represents a transformation on the complex plane. At \\(t = 0\\), we apply \\(g(z)\\) to a function \\(h(z)\\). The goal is to see how \\(H(z)\\) evolves under this transformation.\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: Applying \\(g(z)\\) to \\(h(z)\\) gives us a new function, which we can denote as \\(h'(z) = g(z) \\cdot h(z) = e^{iw}h(z)\\).\n\n3. **Integral Transformation**: The function \\(H(z)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   H(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(z) e^{-ixz} dx.\n   \\]\n   For the transformed function \\(h'(z) = e^{iw}h(z)\\), we need to compute \\(H(g(z))\\):\n   \\[\n   H(g(z)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iw}h(z) e^{-ixz} dx.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Integral**: We can factor out the constant \\(e^{iw}\\) from the integral since it does not depend on the variable of integration \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   H(g(z)) = e^{iw} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(z) e^{-ixz} dx.\n   \\]\n   Recognize that the remaining integral is simply \\(H(z)\\):\n   \\[\n   H(g(z)) = e^{iw} H(z).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Evolution Over Time**: Since the problem states that the function \\(H(z)\\) evolves under the integral transformation without further intervention, and given that \\(g(z)\\) is a simple scaling and rotation transformation (which doesn't change the form of the integral but scales its value by \\(e^{iw}\\)), the function \\(H(g(z))\\) at any time \\(T\\) would still be scaled by \\(e^{iw}\\) relative to \\(H(h(z))\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, \\(H(g(z))\\) at any time \\(T\\) will not be equivalent to \\(H(h(z))\\); instead, it will be scaled by \\(e^{iw}\\). Thus, the answer is no.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if \\(H(g(z))\\) at some later time \\(T\\) is equivalent to \\(H(h(z))\\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Transformation**: The function \\(g(z) = e^{iw}z\\) is applied to \\(h(z)\\) at time \\(t = 0\\). This means we start with \\(h(z)\\) and transform it into \\(g(z)\\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: Both \\(g(z)\\) and \\(h(z)\\) undergo an integral transformation:\n   - For \\(h(z)\\): \\(H(h(z)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(z) e^{-ixz} dx\\)\n   - For \\(g(z)\\): \\(H(g(z)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(z) e^{-ixz} dx\\)\n\n3. **Substitute \\(g(z)\\) into the Integral Transformation**:\n   - Since \\(g(z) = e^{iw}z\\), we substitute this into the integral for \\(H(g(z))\\):\n     \\[\n     H(g(z)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iw}z \\cdot e^{-ixz} dx\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the expression inside the integral:\n     \\[\n     H(g(z)) = e^{iw} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z \\cdot e^{-ixz} dx\n     \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   - Notice that the integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z \\cdot e^{-ixz} dx\\) is not straightforward to evaluate directly due to the presence of \\(z\\). However, we can use properties of the Fourier transform and the fact that the integral transformation \\(H(z)\\) is linear and depends on the specific form of \\(h(z)\\).\n\n5. **Compare \\(H(g(z))\\) and \\(H(h(z))\\)**:\n   - By definition, \\(H(h(z))\\) is the Fourier transform of \\(h(z)\\).\n   - \\(H(g(z))\\) involves a modified version of \\(h(z)\\) through the transformation \\(g(z) = e^{iw}z\\). This transformation scales the argument of the function \\(h(z)\\) by \\(e^{iw}\\), which changes the phase but not the overall structure of the function when considering the Fourier transform.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The transformation \\(g(z) = e^{iw}z\\) modifies the argument of \\(h(z)\\) but does not change the fundamental nature of the function in terms of its Fourier transform. Therefore, the integral transformation applied to \\(g(z)\\) will result in a phase shift compared to the integral transformation applied to \\(h(z)\\), but they are not equivalent unless \\(w = 0\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the transformed function \\(H(g(z))\\) at any later time \\(T\\) will not be equivalent to \\(H(h(z))\\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
