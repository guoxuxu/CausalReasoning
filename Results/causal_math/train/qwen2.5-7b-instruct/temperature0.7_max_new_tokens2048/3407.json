    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal and Transformation**:\n   - We start with a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\).\n   - Applying the first phase shift transformation \\( h(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     h(z) = e^{i\\theta}(u(t) + iv(t)) = e^{i\\theta}u(t) + ie^{i\\theta}v(t)\n     \\]\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( h(z) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     H(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i\\theta}z(t)\\} = e^{i\\theta}Z(\\omega)\n     \\]\n     where \\( Z(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\).\n\n2. **Second Transformation**:\n   - A second phase shift transformation \\( g(z) = e^{i\\phi}z \\) is applied at a specific time \\( t_1 \\). This means that \\( g(z) \\) only affects the signal after \\( t_1 \\).\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\), \\( g(z) = z(t) \\).\n   - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), \\( g(z) = e^{i\\phi}z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Effect on Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier transform of the signal after applying \\( g(z) \\) can be split into two parts:\n     - For \\( t < t_1 \\), the signal remains unchanged, so its Fourier transform is \\( Z(\\omega) \\).\n     - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the signal is multiplied by \\( e^{i\\phi} \\), so its Fourier transform is \\( e^{i\\phi}Z(\\omega) \\).\n\n4. **Final Fourier Transform**:\n   - The overall effect of the transformations on the Fourier transform depends on the time interval \\( t_1 \\):\n     - For \\( t < t_1 \\), the contribution to the Fourier transform is \\( Z(\\omega) \\).\n     - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the contribution is \\( e^{i\\phi}Z(\\omega) \\).\n   - Therefore, the final Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) will include both contributions:\n     \\[\n     Z(\\omega) = Z(\\omega) + e^{i\\phi}Z(\\omega) \\cdot \\text{for } t \\geq t_1\n     \\]\n\nGiven this analysis, the final Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) does not depend solely on the initial phase shift \\( \\theta \\) but also includes the effect of the second phase shift \\( \\phi \\) starting from time \\( t_1 \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze the transformations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal Transformation by \\( h(z) \\):**\n   - The initial signal is \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\).\n   - Applying the phase shift \\( h(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\) to \\( z(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     h(z(t)) = e^{i\\theta} (u(t) + iv(t)) = u(t)\\cos(\\theta) - v(t)\\sin(\\theta) + i(u(t)\\sin(\\theta) + v(t)\\cos(\\theta))\n     \\]\n   - The Fourier transform of this new signal \\( h(z(t)) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     H(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i\\theta}z(t)\\} = e^{i\\theta}Z(\\omega)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Second Transformation by \\( g(z) \\):**\n   - At a specific time \\( t_1 \\), applying another phase shift \\( g(z) = e^{i\\phi}z \\) to the signal:\n     \\[\n     g(h(z(t_1))) = e^{i\\phi} h(z(t_1)) = e^{i\\phi} e^{i\\theta} z(t_1) = e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)} z(t_1)\n     \\]\n   - The Fourier transform of this transformed signal at \\( t_1 \\) is:\n     \\[\n     G(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)} z(t_1)\\} = e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)} Z(\\omega)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Fourier Transform Analysis:**\n   - The Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) itself does not change; it remains the same as it was before the second transformation.\n   - The effect of the second transformation \\( g(z) \\) is only to modify the phase of \\( Z(\\omega) \\) by \\( \\phi + \\theta \\).\n\nGiven that the Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) is modified by the combined phase shift \\( \\phi + \\theta \\), but the original Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) itself does not depend solely on the initial phase shift \\( \\theta \\) without considering the additional phase shift \\( \\phi \\) introduced by \\( g(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the final Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) for \\( \\omega \\) will depend on both the initial phase shift \\( \\theta \\) and the additional phase shift \\( \\phi \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
