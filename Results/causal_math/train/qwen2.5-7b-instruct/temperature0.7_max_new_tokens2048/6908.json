    "To determine whether a function was modulated and to identify the modulation frequency \\( w \\) from its Fourier spectrum \\( F'(\\omega) \\), let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding Modulation**: In signal processing, modulation involves changing some property of a carrier wave (such as amplitude, frequency, or phase) according to the information-bearing signal. Mathematically, if the original signal is \\( z(t) \\), then a simple form of modulation can be represented as \\( z_m(t) = e^{iwt} z(t) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of Modulated Signal**: The Fourier transform of the modulated signal \\( z_m(t) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   F_m'(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}(z_m(t))(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}(e^{iwt} z(t))(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   Using properties of the Fourier transform, this can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   F_m'(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - w) * \\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( * \\) denotes convolution with the impulse response of the modulation, which results in a shift in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Fourier Spectrum**: If the original signal \\( z(t) \\) has a Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega) \\), then the Fourier transform of the modulated signal \\( z_m(t) \\) will have a peak at \\( \\omega = w \\) if the modulation is present. This is due to the convolution with the delta function \\( 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - w) \\).\n\n4. **Identifying Modulation Frequency**: By observing the Fourier spectrum \\( F'(\\omega) \\), one can look for a distinct peak at a specific frequency \\( w \\). This peak indicates the presence of modulation and the frequency \\( w \\) of the modulation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the above steps, it is indeed possible to determine whether a function was modulated and to identify the modulation frequency \\( w \\) from its Fourier spectrum \\( F'(\\omega) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To answer this question, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Understanding Modulation**: In signal processing, modulation refers to the process of varying a carrier wave according to the information signal. For a complex function \\( z(t) \\), modulation typically involves multiplying it by a complex exponential term \\( e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\), where \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the modulation frequency.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Properties**: The Fourier transform of a modulated function \\( z(t)e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\) will have its frequency spectrum centered around \\( \\omega_0 \\). This means that if we observe a significant component in the Fourier spectrum at a specific frequency, it suggests that the original function might have been modulated with that frequency.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Fourier Spectrum**: Given the Fourier spectrum \\( F'(\\omega) \\), we need to look for a peak or significant component at a particular frequency. If such a peak exists, it indicates that the function was likely modulated. The frequency corresponding to this peak would be the modulation frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above points, if there is a distinct peak in the Fourier spectrum at a certain frequency, we can determine that the function was modulated, and we can identify the modulation frequency as the frequency of this peak.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega) \\) of a function \\( z(t) \\) decomposes it into its frequency components. For a modulated signal, the Fourier transform will show peaks at frequencies that correspond to the original signal's frequencies as well as additional frequencies due to the modulation.\n\n2. **Modulation Effect on Fourier Spectrum**: When a signal is modulated by multiplying it with a cosine or sine wave (which is common in amplitude or frequency modulation), the resulting Fourier spectrum will have sidebands around the original frequency components. These sidebands indicate the presence of modulation.\n\n3. **Identifying Modulation Frequency**: If the original signal has a frequency component at \\( f_0 \\) and is modulated by a carrier frequency \\( w \\), the Fourier spectrum will show sidebands at \\( f_0 + w \\) and \\( f_0 - w \\). The distance between these sidebands gives information about the modulation frequency \\( w \\).\n\n4. **Analyzing the Given Information**: We are given the Fourier spectrum \\( F'(\\omega) \\) of a modulated function. This means we can observe the presence of sidebands in the spectrum.\n\n5. **Determining Modulation Presence**: By observing the presence of sidebands in \\( F'(\\omega) \\), we can determine that the function was indeed modulated.\n\n6. **Identifying the Specific Modulation Frequency**: The exact value of the modulation frequency \\( w \\) can be identified by measuring the distance between the sidebands in the Fourier spectrum.\n\nTherefore, based on the given Fourier spectrum \\( F'(\\omega) \\), one can determine that the function was modulated and can also identify the specific modulation frequency \\( w \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Modulation Process**: Modulation in signal processing typically involves changing the amplitude, frequency, or phase of a carrier wave according to the information to be transmitted. In the context of the given function \\(z(t)\\), if it has been modulated, it implies that some part of the function has been altered in a periodic manner.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Analysis**: The Fourier transform \\(F(\\omega)\\) of \\(z(t)\\) decomposes the signal into its constituent frequencies. If the original signal \\(z(t)\\) was unmodulated, its Fourier transform would show peaks at the fundamental frequency and possibly harmonics, depending on the nature of the signal.\n\n3. **Effect of Modulation on Fourier Spectrum**: When a signal is modulated, its Fourier spectrum changes. Specifically, if a signal \\(x(t)\\) is modulated by a carrier with frequency \\(w\\), the resulting modulated signal \\(x(t)\\cos(wt)\\) (or similar form for other types of modulation) will have sidebands around the carrier frequency \\(w\\) in the Fourier domain. These sidebands indicate the presence of modulation.\n\n4. **Identifying the Modulation Frequency**: Given the Fourier spectrum \\(F'(\\omega)\\), if there are significant spectral lines or energy concentrated around a particular frequency \\(w\\), it suggests that the signal was modulated with a carrier frequency close to \\(w\\). However, determining the exact modulation frequency requires more detailed analysis, such as observing the spacing between sidebands in the case of frequency modulation or the shape of the modulating signal in the case of amplitude modulation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the above points, if the Fourier spectrum \\(F'(\\omega)\\) shows distinct spectral lines or energy concentrated around a specific frequency \\(w\\), it strongly indicates that the function was modulated, and the modulation frequency can be identified as \\(w\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"} because the Fourier spectrum can indeed provide information about whether a function was modulated and help in identifying the modulation frequency."
