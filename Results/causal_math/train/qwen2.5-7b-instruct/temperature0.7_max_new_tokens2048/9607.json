Specifically, it modifies the right-hand side of the differential equation from \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\) to \\(\\dot{x} = Dx + g(x)\\).\n\n5. **Transforming the State with \\(g(x)\\)**: The presence of \\(g(x)\\) changes the form of the differential equation, leading to a modified system behavior. The Laplace transform of the new system would involve the term related to \\(g(x)\\), which is not a simple function of \\(D\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the introduction of \\(g(x)\\) changes the system dynamics, the transformed state \\(x(s)\\) will no longer solely depend on \\(D\\).
