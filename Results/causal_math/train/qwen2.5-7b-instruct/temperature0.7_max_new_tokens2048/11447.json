This introduces another phase rotation at \\(t_1\\). The position at \\(t_1\\) after applying \\(h(x)\\) would be:\n   \\[\n   x(t_1) = A e^{i\\theta} e^{i\\phi} \\cos(\\omega t_1 + \\phi_0)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   x(t_1) = A e^{i(\\theta + \\phi)} \\cos(\\omega t_1 + \\phi_0)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Impact on Position at Time \\(T > t_1\\)**:\n   To find the position at time \\(T > t_1\\), we need to consider the evolution of the system from \\(t_1\\) to \\(T\\).
