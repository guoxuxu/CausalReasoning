For this, we need to consider the nature of the transformations \\( M \\) and \\( N \\).\n\n4. **Assumption about Transformation N**:\n   Since \\( N \\) is not specified, we assume it could be any other transformation. However, for the sake of this problem, let's assume \\( N \\) is another linear transformation that also combines rotation and scaling but with different parameters than \\( M \\). Let \\( N = \\begin{bmatrix} c & -d \\\\ d & c \\end{bmatrix} \\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Transformation Identification**:\n   To pinpoint exactly which transformation(s) were used, we need to check if the application of \\( M \\) or \\( N \\) or both can lead to the same final state \\( z(T) \\). Given that \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are distinct matrices with different parameters, they will generally produce different outcomes unless there is a specific condition where their combined effect is the same.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Without additional information about \\( N \\) and the exact form of \\( z(T) \\), we cannot definitively conclude that we can always pinpoint exactly which transformations were used. However, if \\( N \\) is known to be different from \\( M \\), then theoretically, we should be able to distinguish between them based on the transformation properties.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThis is because without knowing the exact form of \\( N \\), we cannot guarantee that we can always distinguish between the use of \\( M \\) alone, \\( N \\) alone, or both transformations to reach \\( z(T) \\)."
