    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial System Impedance**: The initial system has a complex impedance given by \\( Z(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d} \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Adding a Capacitor**: When a parallel capacitor with impedance \\( \\frac{1}{sC} \\) is added, the new overall impedance \\( Z_{\\text{new}}(s) \\) can be found using the formula for parallel impedances:\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{Z(s)} + \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{sC}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{Z(s)} + sC}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the New Impedance**: Substituting \\( Z(s) \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d}} + sC} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{s^2 + cs + d}{s^2 + as + b} + sC}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{s^2 + cs + d + sC(s^2 + as + b)}{s^2 + as + b}} = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + as + b + sC(s^2 + as + b)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + as + b + Cs^3 + Cas^2 + Cbs}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{Cs^3 + (Ca + 1)s^2 + (Cb + a)s + b}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Recovering Original Impedance**: To determine if we can recover \\( Z(s) \\) from \\( Z_{\\text{new}}(s) \\), we need to see if the value of \\( C \\) can be isolated from the new expression.
