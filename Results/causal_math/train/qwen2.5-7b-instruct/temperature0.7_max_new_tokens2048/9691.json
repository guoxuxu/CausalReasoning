    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Transfer Function and Impulse Response:**\n   - The transfer function is \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s-a} \\).\n   - The impulse response \\( h(t) \\) is the inverse Laplace transform of \\( H(s) \\). Therefore, \\( h(t) = e^{at} u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function.\n\n2. **Convolution with External Function \\( \\gamma(t) \\):**\n   - When \\( \\gamma(t) \\) is convolved with \\( h(t) \\), the resulting function is \\( y(t) = h(t) * \\gamma(t) \\).\n   - By the properties of convolution and the Laplace transform, the Laplace transform of \\( y(t) \\) is \\( Y(s) = H(s) \\cdot G(s) \\), where \\( G(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( \\gamma(t) \\).\n\n3. **Differentiation of the Convolution:**\n   - Differentiating \\( y(t) \\) in the time domain is equivalent to multiplying its Laplace transform by \\( s \\). So, the Laplace transform of \\( y'(t) \\) is \\( sY(s) \\).\n   - Substituting \\( Y(s) = H(s) \\cdot G(s) \\) into the above, we get \\( sY(s) = sH(s) \\cdot G(s) = \\frac{s}{s-a} \\cdot G(s) \\).\n\n4. **Analyzing the Resultant Function:**\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( y'(t) \\) is \\( \\frac{s}{s-a} \\cdot G(s) \\).\n   - To find the time-domain function corresponding to this Laplace transform, we need to perform the inverse Laplace transform.\n   - The term \\( \\frac{s}{s-a} \\) can be decomposed as \\( 1 + \\frac{a}{s-a} \\). Thus, the inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{s}{s-a} \\cdot G(s) \\) involves both \\( G(s) \\) and \\( \\frac{a}{s-a} \\cdot G(s) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the resultant function involves terms that depend on both the convolution \\( \\gamma(t) \\) and the constant \\( a \\), it cannot be said that the resultant function depends only on \\( a \\). The external function \\( \\gamma(t) \\) also influences the result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
