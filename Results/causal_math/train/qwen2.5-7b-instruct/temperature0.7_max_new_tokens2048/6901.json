    "To address this question, let's break down the process and reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function and Transformation**:\n   - The given function is \\( h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\).\n   - The Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\{h(x, y)\\} \\) converts \\( h(x, y) \\) from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, resulting in \\( H(u, v) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Properties**:\n   - The Fourier transform of a function in the spatial domain provides information about the function's frequency components.\n   - If no additional operations are applied to \\( H(u, v) \\) after the Fourier transform, it remains just a representation of \\( h(x, y) \\) in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Effect of Linear Operations on \\( H(u, v) \\)**:\n   - Without any further operations (such as filtering, scaling, etc.), \\( H(u, v) \\) retains the exact frequency components of \\( h(x, y) \\).\n   - Linear operations in the frequency domain would modify these components according to specific rules (e.g., convolution in the spatial domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain).\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:\n   - If no modifications are made to \\( H(u, v) \\), applying the inverse Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\{H(u, v)\\} \\) should return us to the original function \\( h(x, y) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since no additional operations are mentioned that alter \\( H(u, v) \\) other than the initial Fourier transform, the function in the spatial domain \\( h(x, y) \\) remains unchanged.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThis is because the statement \"the function in the spatial domain \\( h(x, y) \\) remains unchanged\" is incorrect if we consider the natural behavior of the Fourier transform and its inverse. The function \\( h(x, y) \\) is inherently transformed into \\( H(u, v) \\) and then back to \\( h(x, y) \\) when the inverse Fourier transform is applied. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect that the function does not remain unchanged unless no transformation or operation is explicitly stated to be applied to \\( H(u, v) \\).",
    "To address this question, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function \\( h(x, y) \\):**\n   - The function \\( h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\) represents a paraboloid in three-dimensional space. This function describes a surface where each point \\((x, y)\\) maps to a height \\(z\\) based on the sum of the squares of its coordinates.\n\n2. **Applying the Fourier Transform:**\n   - The Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{h(x, y)\\}(u, v)\\) converts the function from the spatial domain (where it is expressed in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)) to the frequency domain (where it is expressed in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\)).\n   - For \\( h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\), the Fourier transform results in a function \\( H(u, v) \\) that is not straightforward to express in closed form but involves complex mathematical operations.\n\n3. **Effect of Linear Operations in Frequency Domain:**\n   - If we apply linear operations to \\( H(u, v) \\) (such as scaling, shifting, or filtering), these operations will modify \\( H(u, v) \\) in the frequency domain.\n   - These modifications do not directly translate back to the spatial domain without an inverse Fourier transform.\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform and Its Impact:**\n   - When we apply the inverse Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{H(u, v)\\}(x, y)\\) to return to the spatial domain, the function \\( h(x, y) \\) will be modified according to the nature of the operations performed on \\( H(u, v) \\).\n   - Since the operations in the frequency domain affect the coefficients and structure of \\( H(u, v) \\), the resulting function in the spatial domain will generally differ from the original \\( h(x, y) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without further intervention to restore the original form after applying linear operations in the frequency domain, the function \\( h(x, y) \\) will not remain unchanged.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To address this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function and Transform**: The function \\( h(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \\) is given.

Applying the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) to \\( h(x, y) \\) yields \\( H(u, v) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Properties**: The Fourier transform has several key properties, including linearity and the property that it converts multiplication in one domain (spatial or frequency) to convolution in the other domain. However, the Fourier transform itself does not generally preserve the original function form unless the original function has specific symmetries or properties that simplify the transformation.\n\n3. **Effect of Linear Operations in Frequency Domain**: If we apply some linear operations to \\( H(u, v) \\) in the frequency domain, these operations would typically involve convolutions or multiplications in the spatial domain due to the convolution theorem and properties of Fourier transforms. These operations do not inherently preserve the original function form unless they are specifically designed to do so.\n\n4. **Reversibility and Preservation**: Without further intervention, such as applying an inverse Fourier transform and ensuring that the operations in the frequency domain do not alter the original information, the function \\( h(x, y) \\) in the spatial domain will not remain unchanged. The Fourier transform and its inverse are reversible, but the application of arbitrary linear operations in the frequency domain can change the spatial domain representation.\n\nGiven these points, the function \\( h(x, y) \\) in the spatial domain will not remain unchanged if only the Fourier transform is applied and then subjected to some unspecified linear operations in the frequency domain.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

However, the nature of the Fourier transform is such that any operation performed on \\( H(u, v) \\) corresponds to a specific transformation in the spatial domain when the inverse Fourier transform is applied.\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: When the modified \\( H(u, v) \\) is inverse-transformed back to the spatial domain, the resulting function is no longer the same as \\( h(x, y) \\). The inverse Fourier transform recovers the spatial domain function based on the modified frequency components, which have been altered by the linear operations.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the linear operations in the frequency domain change the frequency components, and the inverse Fourier transform recovers a new spatial domain function from these altered components, the function \\( h(x, y) \\) in the spatial domain will not remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
