    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Equation**: The Laplace equation \\(\\Delta u = 0\\) describes a steady-state situation where there are no sources or sinks of the quantity \\(u\\).\n\n2. **Boundary Conditions**: For the Laplace equation, we need boundary conditions to fully determine the solution. These can be Dirichlet (prescribing \\(u\\) on the boundary), Neumann (prescribing the derivative of \\(u\\) on the boundary), or mixed.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Application**: When we apply the Fourier transform to the boundary data \\(g(x)\\), we obtain \\(\\hat{g}(k)\\). The Fourier transform essentially decomposes the function into a sum of sinusoidal functions with different frequencies.\n\n4. **Modified Problem**: If we replace the boundary condition \\(g(x)\\) with \\(\\hat{g}(k)\\) and solve the modified problem, we are effectively changing the boundary condition from a spatially varying function to a frequency-domain representation.\n\n5. **Fundamental Solution Change**: The fundamental solution to the Laplace equation depends on the geometry of \\(\\Omega\\) and the specific form of the boundary condition.
