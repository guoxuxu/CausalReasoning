    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: Before the shift at \\( t = 0 \\), the environmental temperature is \\( T_{env} = T_{base} \\). The system is in equilibrium with the temperature \\( T \\) also equal to \\( T_{base} \\).\n\n2. **Sudden Shift**: At \\( t = 0 \\), the environmental temperature changes to \\( T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + S \\). This represents a sudden increase in the environmental temperature by a constant amount \\( S \\).\n\n3. **Differential Equation**: The differential equation governing the system is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env})\n   \\]\n   Substituting the new \\( T_{env}(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - (T_{base} + S)) = -k(T - T_{base} - S)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Equilibrium Analysis**: To find the new equilibrium temperature, we set \\( \\frac{dT}{dt} = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   0 = -k(T - T_{base} - S)\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( T \\):\n   \\[\n   T = T_{base} + S\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The new equilibrium temperature after the sudden shift is \\( T_{base} + S \\), not \\( T_{base} \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the system's new equilibrium temperature will not remain at \\( T_{base} \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
