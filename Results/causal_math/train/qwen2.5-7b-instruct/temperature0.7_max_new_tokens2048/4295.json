    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The initial trajectory of the particle is given by \\( z(t) = R(t)e^{i\\theta(t)} \\).\n   - A transformation \\( g(z) = z e^{i\\omega t} \\) is applied at a specific time \\( t = t_1 \\).\n\n2. **Intervention**:\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), an intervention is introduced using a new function \\( h(z) = z e^{i\\beta t} \\).\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**:\n   - We need to determine if the position \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is independent of \\( \\omega \\) and only reflects the effects of \\( \\beta \\).\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:\n   - **Transformation \\( g(z) \\)**: \n     - At \\( t = t_1 \\), applying \\( g(z) \\) results in \\( z(t_1) = z(t_1) e^{i\\omega t_1} \\). This introduces a phase shift at \\( t = t_1 \\).\n   - **Intervention \\( h(z) \\)**:\n     - Starting from \\( t = t_1 \\), applying \\( h(z) \\) results in \\( z(t) = z(t) e^{i\\beta (t - t_1)} \\). This phase shift is now governed by \\( \\beta \\).\n   - **Final Position \\( z(T) \\)**:\n     - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the position \\( z(T) \\) will include both the phase shift due to \\( \\omega \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\) and the phase shift due to \\( \\beta \\) from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\).\n     - Therefore, \\( z(T) = z(t_1) e^{i\\omega t_1} e^{i\\beta (T - t_1)} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \\( z(T) \\) includes the effect of \\( \\omega \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\), it cannot be independent of \\( \\omega \\). The position \\( z(T) \\) will reflect the combined effects of both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the position \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is not independent of \\( \\omega \\) and does reflect the effects of both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
