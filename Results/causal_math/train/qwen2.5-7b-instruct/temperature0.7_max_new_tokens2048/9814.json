This means that if we know the exact form of \\( F(p) \\) for all \\( p \\), we can uniquely determine the original function \\( f(x) \\). However, with only one value of \\( F(p) \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( f(x) \\) because multiple functions could have the same Laplace transform at a single point.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Since we only have \\( F(2) = \\frac{2}{5} \\) and not the full transform \\( F(p) \\) for all \\( p \\), we cannot uniquely infer that the original function is \\( \\cos(x) \\). There could be other functions that would yield the same value for \\( F(2) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
