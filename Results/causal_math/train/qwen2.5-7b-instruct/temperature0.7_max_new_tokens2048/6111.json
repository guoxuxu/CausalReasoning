The application of this filter modifies the frequency spectrum of the input signal \\( x(t) \\) to produce \\( X_H(\\omega) \\).\n\n2. **Transformation and Observation Period**: The signal then undergoes some transformation (which is not specified in detail but assumed to be part of the process), and halfway through the observation period, another transformation \\( G(\\omega) = e^{b\\omega^2} \\) is applied.
