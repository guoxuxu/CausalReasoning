In the Fourier domain, the wave equation becomes an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time, which can be solved easily. This is because the spatial derivatives are transformed into multiplication by \\(-\\omega^2\\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform also simplifies the wave equation but in a different way. It transforms the time domain into the complex frequency domain, turning the second-order PDE into a first-order ODE. However, it does not simplify the spatial part as effectively as the Fourier transform does.\n\n4. **Solution Characteristics**: The Fourier transform provides a clear spectral representation of the wave, showing how the wave's energy is distributed across different spatial frequencies.
