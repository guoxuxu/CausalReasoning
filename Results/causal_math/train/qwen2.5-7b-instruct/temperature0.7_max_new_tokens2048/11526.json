    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Linear Differential Operator**: We start with a function \\( f(x) \\) and apply the linear differential operator \\( L = \\frac{d}{dx} \\).

However, we need to be careful because the inverse Fourier transform of \\( G(\\omega) \\) involves dividing by \\( i\\omega \\):\n   \\[\n   g(x) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{G(\\omega)\\} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{i\\omega F(\\omega)\\}.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{i\\omega F(\\omega)\\} = \\frac{df(x)}{dx} \\), we can integrate \\( g(x) \\) to get back \\( f(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(x) = \\int g(x) \\, dx.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determining the Original Function**: To determine the original function \\( f(x) \\) uniquely, we would need additional information such as initial conditions or boundary conditions.
