Therefore, the Fourier transform of the product \\( z(t) \\cdot h(t) \\) is the convolution of \\( Z(f) \\) and the Fourier transform of \\( h(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{int}}(f) = Z(f) * 1 = Z(f)\n   \\]\n   Thus, the frequency spectrum remains unchanged as \\( \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}) \\).\n\n5. **Observation at Time \\( T \\)**: Observing the frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\) will still yield the same result since the intervention does not change the frequency content over time. Specifically, the frequency spectrum at any time \\( t \\) will be \\( \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}) \\).\n\n6. **Determining the Time of Intervention**: Since the frequency spectrum does not change due to the intervention, it is impossible to determine when the intervention occurred (\\( t = T/2 \\)) just by observing the frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\). The frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\) would be the same regardless of whether the intervention happened at \\( t = T/2 \\) or not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To analyze whether the intervention \\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\) was applied at \\( t = T/2 \\) only by observing the frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial State Analysis:**\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), the function is \\( z(0) = e^{i\\omega \\cdot 0} = 1 \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(0) = 1 \\) is a Dirac delta function centered at 0, indicating that all frequencies contribute equally.\n\n2. **Intervention Application:**\n   - The intervention \\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\) is applied at \\( t = T/2 \\).\n   - This intervention modifies the function at \\( t = T/2 \\) to \\( z(T/2) = e^{i\\omega (T/2)} \\cdot e^{-i\\omega (T/2)} = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Intervention on Frequency Spectrum:**\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) after the intervention at \\( t = T/2 \\) will show a phase shift but not a change in magnitude.\n   - Specifically, the phase of the frequency components will be shifted by \\( -\\omega \\cdot T/2 \\).\n\n4. **Observing the Frequency Spectrum at \\( t = T \\):**\n   - At \\( t = T \\), the function \\( z(T) \\) will have been affected by the intervention if it occurred within the interval leading up to \\( T \\).\n   - Since the intervention is applied at \\( t = T/2 \\), the effect on the frequency spectrum will still be present at \\( t = T \\) because the Fourier transform is a linear operation and the phase shift due to the intervention will persist.\n\n5. **Determining the Time of Intervention:**\n   - By observing the frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\), we can see a phase shift corresponding to the intervention at \\( t = T/2 \\).\n   - However, without additional information about the exact form of the function or the nature of the intervention, we cannot definitively pinpoint that the intervention was applied exactly at \\( t = T/2 \\) just from the frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, while we can observe a phase shift indicating the intervention, we cannot conclusively determine that the intervention was applied at \\( t = T/2 \\) only based on the frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
