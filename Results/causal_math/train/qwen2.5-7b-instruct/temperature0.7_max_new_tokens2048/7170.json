    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original system is described by \\(z(t) = e^{it}\\). At \\(t = 0\\), we have:\n   \\[z(0) = e^{i \\cdot 0} = e^0 = 1\\]\n   So, the original complex value \\(z_0\\) at \\(t = 0\\) is 1.\n\n2. The transformation applied is \\(g(z) = z^2\\). If this transformation is applied to \\(z(t)\\), it becomes:\n   \\[g(z(t)) = (e^{it})^2 = e^{2it}\\]\n\n3. Now, let's consider what happens at time \\(T\\):\n   - Without any transformation, at \\(t = T\\), we would have \\(z(T) = e^{iT}\\).\n   - If the transformation \\(g(z)\\) is applied, then at \\(t = T\\), we would have \\(z(T) = e^{2iT}\\).\n\n4. The key point here is that the transformation \\(g(z) = z^2\\) squares the argument of the exponential function. This means that if we observe \\(z(T)\\) at some time \\(T\\), the phase angle could either come from \\(z(T)\\) itself or from \\(g(z(T))\\).\n\n5. To deduce \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(T)\\), we need to determine if the observed \\(z(T)\\) came directly from \\(z(t)\\) or if it has been transformed by \\(g(z)\\). However, there's no way to distinguish between these two cases just by looking at \\(z(T)\\) alone because both \\(z(T)\\) and \\(g(z(T))\\) can result in the same observed value if we only know \\(z(T)\\).\n\n6. For example, if \\(z(T) = e^{i\\theta}\\), then \\(z(T)\\) could be the result of either \\(e^{i\\theta}\\) or \\(e^{2i\\theta/2}\\) after applying \\(g(z)\\). Without additional information about whether the transformation was applied, we cannot uniquely determine the original \\(z_0\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Transformation**:\n   - The original function is \\(z(t) = e^{it}\\).\n   - The transformation applied is \\(g(z) = z^2\\).\n\n2. **Initial Condition**:\n   - At \\(t = 0\\), \\(z(0) = e^{i \\cdot 0} = 1\\).
