    "Let's analyze the given function and transformation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\( z(x) = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x) \\).

Applying this transformation to the initial function, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(x, t) = (\\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)) \\cdot e^{tx}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplification Using Euler's Formula**: We can rewrite \\( e^{tx} \\) using Euler's formula:\n   \\[\n   e^{tx} = \\cos(tx) + i\\sin(tx)\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   z(x, t) = (\\cos(x) + i\\sin(x))(\\cos(tx) + i\\sin(tx))\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiplication of Complex Numbers**: When multiplying two complex numbers, we use the distributive property:\n   \\[\n   z(x, t) = \\cos(x)\\cos(tx) - \\sin(x)\\sin(tx) + i(\\sin(x)\\cos(tx) + \\cos(x)\\sin(tx))\n   \\]\n   Recognizing trigonometric identities, we have:\n   \\[\n   z(x, t) = \\cos(x + tx) + i\\sin(x + tx) = \\cos((1+t)x) + i\\sin((1+t)x)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Interpretation**: The expression \\( \\cos((1+t)x) + i\\sin((1+t)x) \\) again represents Euler's formula with an argument of \\((1+t)x\\). This means that the phase angle of the complex number has changed from \\( x \\) to \\((1+t)x\\).\n\n6. **Rotation in the Complex Plane**: A change in the argument of a complex number corresponds to a rotation in the complex plane.
