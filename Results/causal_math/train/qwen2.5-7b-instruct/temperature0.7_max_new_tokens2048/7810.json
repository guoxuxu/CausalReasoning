    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation \\( x_{new}(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(t-\\tau)}Bu(\\tau) d\\tau \\) is an integral form that relates the system's state \\( x(t) \\) to the input \\( u(t) \\).

This suggests that the transformation might be reversible.\n\n4. **Reversibility Check**: For the transformation to allow us to uniquely determine \\( u(\\tau) \\), it must be possible to reverse the process. In other words, given \\( x_{new}(t) \\), we should be able to find \\( u(\\tau) \\) uniquely.\n\n5. **Inverse Problem**: The inverse problem here would involve solving the integral equation for \\( u(\\tau) \\). Given the properties of the matrix exponential and the linearity of the system, it is theoretically possible to solve for \\( u(\\tau) \\) if we have \\( x_{new}(t) \\) and knowledge of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: With the correct mathematical tools (such as convolution and Laplace transforms), we can indeed determine the input history \\( u(\\tau) \\) uniquely from \\( x_{new}(t) \\), provided we know \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n\nThe reasoning above shows that while the transformation allows us to relate the state to the input, it does not inherently imply that the input history can be uniquely determined without additional information or specific conditions on the matrices involved. The question specifically asks if we can uniquely determine the input history without additional data, which implies that there could be scenarios where the input history cannot be uniquely determined, such as when the system is underdetermined or when there are multiple inputs that produce the same state response.",
