    "To determine if we can reconstruct the exact initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( \\hat{u}(\\omega, T) \\), let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Heat Equation**: The function \\( u(x, t) \\) describes the heat distribution along a rod and is governed by the heat equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   This tells us how the temperature changes over time due to diffusion.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( u(x, t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\omega, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x, t) e^{-i\\omega x} dx\n   \\]\n   Applying the Fourier transform to the heat equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k \\omega^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   This is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) in \\( t \\).\n\n3. **Initial Condition in Fourier Domain**: The Fourier transform of the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0)\n   \\]\n   Using the ODE derived from the Fourier transform of the heat equation, we can solve for \\( \\hat{u}(\\omega, t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\omega, t) = \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) e^{-k \\omega^2 t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Reconstructing Initial Condition**: To find \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( \\hat{u}(\\omega, T) \\), we need to reverse the Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   u(x, 0) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(\\omega, T)]\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\) denotes the inverse Fourier transform. Since we know the form of \\( \\hat{u}(\\omega, T) \\) in terms of \\( \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\omega, T) = \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) e^{-k \\omega^2 T}\n   \\]\n   We can isolate \\( \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) \\) by dividing both sides by \\( e^{-k \\omega^2 T} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) = \\hat{u}(\\omega, T) e^{k \\omega^2 T}\n   \\]\n   Then, applying the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   u(x, 0) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(\\omega, T) e^{k \\omega^2 T}]\n   \\]\n   This shows that we can indeed reconstruct the exact initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( \\hat{u}(\\omega, T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To address this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation given is \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\). This describes how the temperature \\(u(x, t)\\) evolves over time \\(t\\) along a rod of length \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: The Fourier transform \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x, t) e^{-i\\omega x} dx\\) converts the spatial part of the heat equation into a frequency domain representation. Applying the Fourier transform to both sides of the heat equation gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k \\omega^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   This is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time for each frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\n3. **Initial Condition Transformation**: The initial condition \\(u(x, 0)\\) transforms to \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, 0)\\) via the Fourier transform. The solution to the ODE in the Fourier domain is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\omega, t) = \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) e^{-k \\omega^2 t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Reconstruction from \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, T)\\)**: Knowing \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, T)\\), we can express \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, 0)\\) as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) = \\hat{u}(\\omega, T) e^{k \\omega^2 T}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: The inverse Fourier transform allows us to recover \\(u(x, 0)\\) from \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, 0)\\):\n   \\[\n   u(x, 0) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(\\omega, 0)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[ \\hat{u}(\\omega, T) e^{k \\omega^2 T} ]\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\) denotes the inverse Fourier transform.\n\nGiven all these steps, we can indeed reconstruct the exact initial condition \\(u(x, 0)\\) from \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, T)\\) if we know that the evolution follows the Fourier-transformed heat equation. This is because the relationship between \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, T)\\) and \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, 0)\\) is deterministic and invertible through the inverse Fourier transform.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
