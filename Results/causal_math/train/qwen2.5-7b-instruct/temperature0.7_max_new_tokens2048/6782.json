    "To determine if we can find the original function \\( g(x) \\) without knowing whether the linear operator \\( L \\) was applied, let's reason through the steps:\n\n1. **Define the Transformation**: The given transformation is \\( G(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\), which is the Laplace transform of \\( g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Linear Operator**: The linear operator \\( L \\) is defined as \\( Lg(x) = xg(x) \\). If \\( L \\) is applied to \\( g(x) \\), the new function becomes \\( Lg(x) = xg(x) \\).\n\n3. **Transform the New Function**: We need to find the Laplace transform of \\( Lg(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{Lg(x)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} (xg(x)) dx.\n   \\]\n   Using integration by parts, where \\( u = x \\) and \\( dv = e^{-sx} g(x) dx \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} (xg(x)) dx = \\left[ -\\frac{x}{s} e^{-sx} g(x) \\right]_0^\\infty + \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{s} e^{-sx} g(x) dx.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( g(x) \\) is assumed to be well-behaved and decays sufficiently fast at infinity, the boundary term vanishes, and we are left with:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} (xg(x)) dx = \\frac{1}{s} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) dx = \\frac{1}{s} G(s).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine \\( g(x) \\)**: From the above result, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{Lg(x)\\}(s) = \\frac{1}{s} G(s).\n   \\]\n   This means that if we know \\( G(s) \\) (the Laplace transform of \\( g(x) \\)), we can determine the Laplace transform of \\( Lg(x) \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{s} G(s) \\). However, this does not provide us with the original function \\( g(x) \\) directly.\n\n5. **Inverse Transform**: To find \\( g(x) \\) from \\( G(s) \\), we would use the inverse Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   g(x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\}(x).\n   \\]\n   Similarly, to find \\( Lg(x) \\) from \\( \\frac{1}{s} G(s) \\), we would use:\n   \\[\n   Lg(x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s} G(s)\\right\\}(x).\n   \\]\n   Knowing \\( Lg(x) \\) alone does not give us \\( g(x) \\) because the inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s} G(s) \\) involves a multiplication by \\( x \\), which is the effect of the operator \\( L \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about the nature of \\( g(x) \\) or the specific form of \\( L \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( g(x) \\) just from \\( Lg(x) \\) and \\( G(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can find the original function \\( g(x) \\) from \\( G(s) \\) without knowing whether the linear operator \\( L \\) was applied, let's analyze the given information step-by-step.\n\n1. **Definition of the Transform**: \n   The transform \\( G(s) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) \\, dx\n   \\]\n   This is the Laplace transform of \\( g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Effect of the Linear Operator**:\n   The linear operator \\( L \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   Lg(x) = xg(x)\n   \\]\n   Applying \\( L \\) to \\( g(x) \\) gives us \\( Lg(x) \\).\n\n3. **Transform of \\( Lg(x) \\)**:\n   The Laplace transform of \\( Lg(x) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{Lg(x)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} (xg(x)) \\, dx\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Laplace transform for multiplication by \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{xg(x)\\}(s) = -\\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) \\, dx \\right)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( G(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) \\, dx \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{xg(x)\\}(s) = -\\frac{dG(s)}{ds}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Recovering \\( g(x) \\)**:\n   To recover \\( g(x) \\) from \\( G(s) \\), we need to invert the Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   g(x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\}\n   \\]\n   However, to recover \\( g(x) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Lg(x)\\}(s) \\), which is \\( -\\frac{dG(s)}{ds} \\), we need to know the derivative of \\( G(s) \\).
