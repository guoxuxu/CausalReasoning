    "To determine if the alterations by \\( e^{at} \\) or \\( e^{bt} \\) (or both) can be uniquely identified from \\( U(s) \\), let's analyze the transformations step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Transformation**: We start with the original function \\( u(t) \\) and its Laplace transform \\( U(s) \\).\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( e^{at} \\)**: If \\( u(t) \\) is altered by \\( e^{at} \\), the new function becomes \\( u(t)e^{at} \\). The Laplace transform of \\( u(t)e^{at} \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)e^{at}\\}(s) = U(s-a)\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Laplace transform \\( U(s) \\) shifts to the right by \\( a \\) when \\( e^{at} \\) is applied.\n\n3. **Transformation by \\( e^{bt} \\)**: Similarly, if \\( u(t) \\) is altered by \\( e^{bt} \\), the new function becomes \\( u(t)e^{bt} \\). The Laplace transform of \\( u(t)e^{bt} \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)e^{bt}\\}(s) = U(s-b)\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Laplace transform \\( U(s) \\) shifts to the right by \\( b \\) when \\( e^{bt} \\) is applied.\n\n4. **Combined Transformations**:\n   - If both \\( e^{at} \\) and \\( e^{bt} \\) are applied, the new function is \\( u(t)e^{at}e^{bt} = u(t)e^{(a+b)t} \\). The Laplace transform of \\( u(t)e^{(a+b)t} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)e^{(a+b)t}\\}(s) = U(s-(a+b))\n     \\]\n   - If only one of them is applied, say \\( e^{at} \\), then:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)e^{at}\\}(s) = U(s-a)\n     \\]\n   - If only \\( e^{bt} \\) is applied, then:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)e^{bt}\\}(s) = U(s-b)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Determination**: To determine uniquely whether the alterations by \\( e^{at} \\) or \\( e^{bt} \\) were applied, we need to check if the shift in \\( U(s) \\) can be uniquely attributed to either \\( a \\) or \\( b \\) or both. Since the shifts are distinct (i.e., \\( a \\neq b \\)), the transformed \\( U(s) \\) will show a specific shift that indicates which alteration was made. Specifically:\n   - A shift to the right by \\( a \\) indicates \\( e^{at} \\) was applied.\n   - A shift to the right by \\( b \\) indicates \\( e^{bt} \\) was applied.\n   - A shift to the right by \\( a+b \\) indicates both \\( e^{at} \\) and \\( e^{bt} \\) were applied.\n\nSince each shift corresponds to a unique alteration, we can determine uniquely whether the alterations by \\( e^{at} \\) or \\( e^{bt} \\) were applied, just by examining \\( U(s) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
