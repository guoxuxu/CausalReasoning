This is a nonlinear first-order differential equation.\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**:\n   The transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\). This transformation integrates \\( z(t) \\) with a weight factor \\( e^{-s} \\).\n\n3. **Knowledge of \\( T(z(T)) \\)**:\n   We know \\( T(z(T)) \\) at some \\( T > t \\), which means we have the value of the integral transformation up to time \\( T \\).\n\n4. **Inverting the Transformation**:\n   To determine if we can deduce \\( z(t) \\) for all \\( t \\in [0, T] \\) from \\( T(z(T)) \\), we need to consider if this transformation is invertible. The key issue here is that \\( T(z(T)) \\) only provides information about the weighted average of \\( z(t) \\) from 0 to \\( T \\), not the exact values of \\( z(t) \\) at each point.\n\n5. **Non-uniqueness and Nonlinearity**:\n   - The differential equation is nonlinear, meaning small changes in initial conditions can lead to large differences in solutions (sensitive dependence on initial conditions).\n   - The integral transformation averages out the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) over the interval, losing specific details about the function's behavior at different times.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Given the nonlinearity and the averaging effect of the integral transformation, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) for all \\( t \\in [0, T] \\) just from \\( T(z(T)) \\) without additional information such as initial conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
