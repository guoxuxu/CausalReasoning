If we apply the transformation \\( P(t) \\) to the state vector at each time \\( t \\), the transformed state vector \\( y(t) \\) satisfies:\n   \\[\n   y'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} (e^{Mt} x(t)) = e^{Mt} x'(t) + M e^{Mt} x(t) = e^{Mt} (L x(t) + M x(t)) = e^{Mt} (L + M) x(t).\n   \\]\n   However, since \\( y(t) = e^{Mt} x(t) \\), it follows that:\n   \\[\n   y'(t) = (L + M) y(t).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparison**: The original system without transformation evolves according to \\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\). The transformed system evolves according to \\( y'(t) = (L + M) y(t) \\). These are different differential equations unless \\( M = 0 \\), which would imply no transformation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: For the states to be the same at time \\( T \\), the solutions to these two differential equations must be identical. Since \\( y'(t) = (L + M) y(t) \\neq L y(t) \\) unless \\( M = 0 \\), the states will generally differ unless the transformation matrix \\( M \\) is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
