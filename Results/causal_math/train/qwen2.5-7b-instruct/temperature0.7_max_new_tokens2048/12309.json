    "To determine if we can deduce the value of the transformed function \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) at \\( t=0 \\) from observing \\( z(T) \\), let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Given Differential System**: The system is described by \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\), where \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) and \\( c \\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\n2. **Integral Transform**: The transform is given by \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\).\n\n3. **Observation at Time T**: We know \\( z(T) \\), but we need to determine \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) at \\( t=0 \\).\n\n4. **Causal Reasoning**:\n    - The differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = z^2 + c \\) describes how \\( z(t) \\) evolves over time.\n    - The integral transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) involves integrating \\( z(t) \\) from 0 to infinity, which means it depends on the entire history of \\( z(t) \\).\n    - Knowing \\( z(T) \\) only gives us information about the state of \\( z(t) \\) at a specific time \\( T \\), but does not provide information about the initial condition \\( z(0) \\) without additional constraints or knowledge of the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) between \\( 0 \\) and \\( T \\).\n\n5. **Deduction**:\n    - Without knowing the exact form of \\( z(t) \\) for all \\( t \\) from 0 to \\( T \\) (or beyond), it is impossible to directly deduce \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) at \\( t=0 \\) just from \\( z(T) \\). The integral transform involves the entire history of \\( z(t) \\), so even if we knew \\( z(T) \\), we would still lack the necessary information about the initial conditions and the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) before \\( T \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we conclude that it is not possible to deduce the exact value of \\( \\mathcal{F}(z) \\) at \\( t=0 \\) solely from observing \\( z(T) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
