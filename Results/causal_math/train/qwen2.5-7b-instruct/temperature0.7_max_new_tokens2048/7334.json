The solution \\(u(x,y)\\) is uniquely determined by the boundary conditions and does not change over time.\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, we cannot deduce the original function \\(u(x,y)\\) at any past state just by observing \\(U(k_x, k_y)\\) at a current time.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
