The general solution can be found using the integrating factor method or by recognizing it as a form of exponential growth/decay with a constant term.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Transformation \\(g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z\\)\nAt times \\(t_n = nT\\), the transformation \\(g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z\\) is applied. This changes the state of the system from \\(z(t)\\) to \\(z'(t) = e^{\\alpha t}z(t)\\). \n\nSubstituting \\(z(t) = e^{-\\alpha t}z'(t)\\) into the original differential equation:\n\\[ \\frac{d(e^{-\\alpha t}z'(t))}{dt} = i\\omega e^{-\\alpha t}z'(t) + k \\]\n\\[ -\\alpha e^{-\\alpha t}z'(t) + e^{-\\alpha t}\\frac{dz'}{dt} = i\\omega e^{-\\alpha t}z'(t) + k \\]\n\\[ e^{-\\alpha t}\\left(\\frac{dz'}{dt} - (\\alpha + i\\omega)z'\\right) = k \\]\n\\[ \\frac{dz'}{dt} - (\\alpha + i\\omega)z' = ke^{\\alpha t} \\]\n\nThis is another first-order linear differential equation, but now with a non-homogeneous term \\(ke^{\\alpha t}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Additional Transformation \\(h(z) = e^{\\beta t}z\\)\nAfter some time \\(t_1\\), an additional transformation \\(h(z) = e^{\\beta t}z\\) is applied. This changes the state of the system from \\(z'(t)\\) to \\(z''(t) = e^{\\beta t}z'(t)\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(z'(t) = e^{-\\beta t}z''(t)\\) into the transformed differential equation:\n\\[ \\frac{d(e^{-\\beta t}z''(t))}{dt} - (\\alpha + i\\omega)e^{-\\beta t}z''(t) = ke^{\\alpha t}e^{\\beta t} \\]\n\\[ -\\beta e^{-\\beta t}z''(t) + e^{-\\beta t}\\frac{dz''}{dt} - (\\alpha + i\\omega)e^{-\\beta t}z''(t) = ke^{\\alpha t + \\beta t} \\]\n\\[ e^{-\\beta t}\\left(\\frac{dz''}{dt} - (\\alpha + \\beta + i\\omega)z''\\right) = ke^{(\\alpha + \\beta)t} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{dz''}{dt} - (\\alpha + \\beta + i\\omega)z'' = ke^{\\alpha t + \\beta t} \\]\n\nThis is again a first-order linear differential equation, but with a different non-homogeneous term \\(ke^{\\alpha t + \\beta t}\\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Long-Term Behavior\nTo understand the long-term behavior, consider the homogeneous part of the differential equations:\n- For \\(z(t)\\): \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\)\n- For \\(z'(t)\\): \\(\\frac{dz'}{dt} = (\\alpha + i\\omega)z'\\)\n- For \\(z''(t)\\): \\(\\frac{dz''}{dt} = (\\alpha + \\beta + i\\omega)z''\\)\n\nThe solutions to these homogeneous equations are:\n- \\(z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t}\\)\n- \\(z'(t) = Ce^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)t}\\)\n- \\(z''(t) = Ce^{(\\alpha + \\beta + i\\omega)t}\\)\n\nIn the limit as \\(t \\to \\infty\\), the terms involving \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) become less significant compared to \\(i\\omega\\) because they are exponential growth/decay factors.
