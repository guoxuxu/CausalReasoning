The inverse Laplace transform can be used to recover \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) from \\(T(u)\\) and \\(T(v)\\):\n   \\[\n   u(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{T(u)\\}(t)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{T(v)\\}(t)\n   \\]\n   Once we have \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\), we can define \\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Given that the inverse Laplace transform is well-defined and unique for appropriate functions, we can indeed recover \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) from \\(T(u)\\) and \\(T(v)\\), and subsequently \\(z(t)\\) from \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, with the necessary conditions met (such as the functions being Laplace transformable), we can exactly recover the original function \\(z(x)\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can exactly recover the original function \\( z(x) \\) from \\( T(z)(x) \\), let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**:\n   The transformation \\( T \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   T(z)(x) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt} z(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real-valued functions of \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Decomposition of \\( T(z)(x) \\)**:\n   Substituting \\( z(t) \\) into the transformation, we get:\n   \\[\n   T(z)(x) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt} (u(t) + iv(t)) dt\n   \\]\n   This can be separated into real and imaginary parts:\n   \\[\n   T(z)(x) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt} u(t) dt + i \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt} v(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Let:\n   \\[\n   A(x) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt} u(t) dt \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B(x) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-xt} v(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Then:\n   \\[\n   T(z)(x) = A(x) + iB(x)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Recovery of \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\)**:\n   To recover \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) from \\( A(x) \\) and \\( B(x) \\), we need to find the inverse Laplace transform. The inverse Laplace transform of \\( A(x) \\) and \\( B(x) \\) would give us back \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\), respectively.\n\n4. **Inversion Using Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   The inverse Laplace transform of \\( A(x) \\) and \\( B(x) \\) are:\n   \\[\n   u(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{A(x)\\}(t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{B(x)\\}(t)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the original function \\( z(t) \\) can be recovered as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{A(x)\\}(t) + i\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{B(x)\\}(t)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Given that the inverse Laplace transform exists and is unique for well-behaved functions, we can indeed exactly recover \\( z(t) \\) from \\( T(z)(x) \\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
