    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Given Function**: \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\)\n2. **Transformation**: \\( F[z](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\)\n\nFirst, we need to apply the transformation \\( F[z](s) \\) to \\( z(t) \\):\n\n\\[ F[z](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} \\, dt \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ F[z](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s - i\\omega)t} \\, dt \\]\n\nThe integral converges if the real part of \\( s \\) (denoted as \\( \\Re(s) \\)) is greater than the real part of \\( i\\omega \\), which is 0.

At \\( t = 0 \\), it is 1. Therefore:\n\n\\[ F[z](s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) after applying \\( F[z](s) \\). The problem states that \\( z(T) \\) should be evaluated for any \\( T > 0 \\) without further intervention, implying that \\( z(t) \\) should follow its original form.\n\nSince the transformation \\( F[z](s) \\) does not change the original function \\( z(t) \\) over time (it only provides a representation in the Laplace domain), \\( z(t) \\) will continue to follow its original form:\n\n\\[ z(T) = e^{i\\omega T} \\]\n\nThus, for any \\( T > 0 \\), \\( z(T) \\) will indeed be equal to \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
