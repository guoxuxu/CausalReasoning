At time \\( T \\), \\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\).\n- **Scenario 2 (With \\( g(z) \\))**: After applying \\( g(z) \\) once, the value remains \\( 1 \\). Then, it evolves according to \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\). At time \\( T \\), \\( z(T) = e^{iT} \\).\n\nIn both scenarios, the value at time \\( T \\) is \\( e^{iT} \\). Therefore, \\( z(T) \\) will be the same in both cases if \\( T \\) is a real number.\n\nThe answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
