    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: The system described is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system because the differential equations are linear and the coefficients (A, B, C, D) are constants. LTI systems have the property that their response to a shifted input is the same as the original response shifted in time.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform and Initial Conditions**: The Fourier transform of a function represents its frequency content. For an LTI system, the Fourier transform of the output depends on the Fourier transform of the input and the system's transfer function. However, the initial conditions can affect the time-domain solution but not necessarily the frequency-domain representation directly.\n\n3. **Effect of Initial Conditions**: Changing the initial condition from \\( z(0) \\) to \\( z'(0) \\) will change the time-domain solution of the system. This is because the solution to a differential equation depends on both the differential equation itself and the initial conditions.\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of the Solution**: The Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) of the solution \\( z(t) \\) will depend on the specific form of \\( z(t) \\).
