    "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform for \\( g(t) \\):**\n   - The given Laplace transform for \\( g(t) = t^2 \\) is \\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) = \\frac{2}{s^3} \\).\n   - This is derived from the general formula for the Laplace transform of \\( t^n \\), which is \\( \\mathcal{L}(t^n) = \\frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \\).

However, since the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is explicitly given, we need to check if any other function could yield the same transform.\n\n3. **Uniqueness of Laplace Transforms:**\n   - The Laplace transform is unique for each function under certain conditions (analyticity and decay at infinity).
