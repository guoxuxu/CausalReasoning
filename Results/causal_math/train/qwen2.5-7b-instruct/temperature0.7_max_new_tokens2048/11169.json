Since \\( G(s) = s^n F(s) \\) corresponds to \\( t^n f(t) \\) after inverse transformation, and directly applying \\( M(s) \\) in the time domain means differentiating \\( f(t) \\) \\( n \\) times, the results are not the same unless \\( f(t) \\) itself is a polynomial of degree less than \\( n \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is no, because the operations do not yield the same result in general.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if \\( L^{-1}[G(s)](t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) will be the same as \\( L^{-1}[F(s)](t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) after applying the operation defined by \\( M(s) = s^n \\) to \\( F(s) \\) to generate \\( G(s) = s^n F(s) \\), let's reason through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation**: We start with \\( F(s) \\) which is the Laplace transform of some function \\( f(t) \\). That is, \\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\).\n\n2. **Application of \\( M(s) \\)**: Applying \\( M(s) = s^n \\) to \\( F(s) \\) results in \\( G(s) = s^n F(s) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform of \\( G(s) \\)**: The inverse Laplace transform of \\( G(s) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   L^{-1}[G(s)](t) = L^{-1}[s^n F(s)](t)\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Laplace transform that states:\n   \\[\n   L^{-1}[s^n F(s)](t) = \\frac{d^n}{dt^n} f(t)\n   \\]\n   This means that \\( L^{-1}[G(s)](t) \\) is the \\( n \\)-th derivative of \\( f(t) \\).\n\n4. **Direct Application Without \\( M(s) \\)**: If we had applied the operation directly on \\( f(t) \\) without transforming it to the Laplace domain, the result would be the \\( n \\)-th derivative of \\( f(t) \\) evaluated at \\( t = T \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^n}{dt^n} f(t) \\Bigg|_{t=T}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**: Since both methods result in taking the \\( n \\)-th derivative of \\( f(t) \\), the values at \\( t = T \\) should be the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
