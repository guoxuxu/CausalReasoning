This path is influenced by the initial transformation \\( g(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( g(z) \\)**: At any time \\( t \\), the transformation \\( g(z) \\) modifies the position of \\( z \\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z\n   \\]\n   This means that at time \\( t_1 \\), the function becomes:\n   \\[\n   g(z(t_1)) = e^{i\\omega t_1}z(t_1)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention \\( h(z) \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( h(z) = e^{i\\theta t}z \\) is applied. This introduces another phase shift:\n   \\[\n   h(z(t_1)) = e^{i\\theta t_1}z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   However, since \\( h(z) \\) is only applied at \\( t_1 \\) and not continuously, it does not affect the path traced after \\( t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Natural Dynamics Post-Intervention**: For \\( t > t_1 \\), the path continues under the influence of \\( g(z) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)}z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( z(t_1) \\) is the state of the system at \\( t_1 \\), which has been modified by both \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\) up to that point.\n\n5. **Effect of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\)**: The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on the combined effect of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\) up to \\( t_1 \\). Specifically, the phase shift introduced by \\( h(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) will be part of the overall phase factor:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)}e^{i\\theta t_1}z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\( z(T) \\) indeed depends on both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
