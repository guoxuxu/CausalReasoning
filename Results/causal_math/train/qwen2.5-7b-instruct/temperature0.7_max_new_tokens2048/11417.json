    "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Convolution**: The convolution of the function \\( p(x) \\) with a Gaussian kernel \\( G(x; \\sigma) \\) results in a new function \\( p_{new}(x) = p(x) * G(x; \\sigma) \\). Convolution in the spatial domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Properties**: The Fourier transform of a convolution of two functions is the product of their Fourier transforms. Mathematically, if \\( P(f) = F(p(x)) \\) and \\( G(f) = F(G(x; \\sigma)) \\), then the Fourier transform of \\( p_{new}(x) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   F(p_{new}(x)) = F(p(x) * G(x; \\sigma)) = P(f) \\cdot G(f)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Gaussian Kernel in Frequency Domain**: The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function \\( G(x; \\sigma) \\) is another Gaussian function in the frequency domain. Specifically, \\( G(f; \\sigma) = e^{-\\pi^2 \\sigma^2 f^2} \\).\n\n4. **Effect on Characteristic Frequencies**: When we multiply \\( P(f) \\) by \\( G(f) \\), we are effectively attenuating the amplitudes of the characteristic frequencies in \\( P(f) \\) according to the shape of \\( G(f) \\). This means that while the characteristic frequencies are retained, their amplitudes are modified by the Gaussian envelope.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While the characteristic frequencies of \\( F(p(x)) \\) are not strictly retained because their amplitudes are changed by the Gaussian kernel, the qualitative nature of the frequency components is preserved. However, the statement \"strictly retain the characteristic frequencies\" implies no changes in both amplitude and phase, which is not accurate here.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
