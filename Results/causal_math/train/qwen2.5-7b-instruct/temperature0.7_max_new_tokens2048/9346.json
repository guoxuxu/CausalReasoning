    "To determine if the initial distribution \\( u(x, 0) \\) can be precisely determined from observing the temperature distribution \\( u(x, T) \\) at some time \\( T \\), let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\) describes how the temperature \\( u(x, t) \\) changes over time due to thermal diffusion.
