Therefore, it cannot be said to depend solely on the original differential equations without considering the impact of the intervention.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the above reasoning, the output of \\( T(z)(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on the intervention caused by \\( u(t) = e^{kt} \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
