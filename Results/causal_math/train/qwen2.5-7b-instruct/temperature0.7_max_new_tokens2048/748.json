    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation \\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\) represents an exponential scaling and rotation of the complex function \\( z(t) \\). Here, \\( e^{St} \\) is a matrix exponential, which can be thought of as a continuous-time version of a linear transformation that includes both scaling and rotation properties.\n\n2. **Effect on the System**: Applying \\( f(z) \\) to the system means multiplying the entire state vector \\( z(t) \\) by \\( e^{St} \\).
