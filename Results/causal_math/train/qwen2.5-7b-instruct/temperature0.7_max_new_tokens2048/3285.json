This transformation modifies the state vector \\( z \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Transformation on Initial State**: If we apply the transformation \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), it changes the initial state of the system.

The transformation \\( f(z) \\) does not affect the subsequent evolution of the system; it only modifies the starting point.\n   - Therefore, the state \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t > 0 \\) will follow the same dynamics as before, but starting from \\( Cz(0) \\) instead of \\( z(0) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the system's evolution after \\( t = 0 \\) is solely determined by its dynamics and the initial condition, and since no additional transformations are applied after the initial transformation, the function \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T \\) will not remain unchanged compared to the scenario where no initial transformation was applied.
