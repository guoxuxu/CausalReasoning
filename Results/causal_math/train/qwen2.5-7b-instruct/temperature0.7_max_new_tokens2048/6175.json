    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Kz\\). The solution to this differential equation is given by \\(z(t) = z(0)e^{Kt}\\), where \\(z(0)\\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: Applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Kz\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   s\\tilde{z}(s) - z(0) = K\\tilde{z}(s)\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(\\tilde{z}(s)\\), we obtain:\n   \\[\n   \\tilde{z}(s) = \\frac{z(0)}{s - K}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\(t_1\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), the value of \\(K\\) is changed to \\(M\\). This means that for \\(t > t_1\\), the differential equation becomes \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\).\n\n4. **New Solution After Intervention**: For \\(t > t_1\\), the solution to the new differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\) is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(t_1)e^{M(t-t_1)}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(z(t_1)\\) is the state of the system just after the intervention at \\(t_1\\).\n\n5. **State Just Before Intervention**: The state of the system just before the intervention (at \\(t = t_1\\)) is:\n   \\[\n   z(t_1) = z(0)e^{Kt_1}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final State for \\(t > t_1\\)**: Substituting \\(z(t_1) = z(0)e^{Kt_1}\\) into the expression for \\(z(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0)e^{Kt_1}e^{M(t-t_1)} = z(0)e^{(K-M)(t_1-t_1)}e^{M(t-t_1)} = z(0)e^{M(t-t_1)}\n   \\]\n   This shows that the state of the system for \\(t > t_1\\) depends only on the new constant \\(M\\) and not on the original constant \\(K\\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the state \\(z(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) will indeed be altered by the change from \\(K\\) to \\(M\\) at \\(t_1\\), and it will not be unaltered by the original \\(K\\) before \\(t_1\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to \\( \\dot{z} = Kz \\). The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\tilde{z}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\frac{z(0)}{s - K}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( z(0) \\) is the initial condition of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n2. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), \\( K \\) is modified to \\( M \\). This changes the differential equation to \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Impact of the Intervention**: For \\( t > t_1 \\), the new differential equation is \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\).

Therefore, the state \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) is not independent of the original \\( K \\) before \\( t_1 \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the state \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) is indeed influenced by the original \\( K \\) before \\( t_1 \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
