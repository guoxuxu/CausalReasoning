It only scales the entire system by a factor that depends on time. The transformed system can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{x} = Ae^{Ct}x - Be^{Ct}y \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\dot{y} = Be^{Ct}x + Ae^{Ct}y.\n   \\]\n   However, this scaling does not alter the fundamental behavior of \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) defined by \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n3. **Intervention by \\(g(z) = e^{Dt}z\\)**: Introducing an additional transformation \\(g(z) = e^{Dt}z\\) at some time \\(t_1\\) means that from \\(t_1\\) onwards, the system is scaled by an additional factor \\(e^{D(t-t_1)}\\).
