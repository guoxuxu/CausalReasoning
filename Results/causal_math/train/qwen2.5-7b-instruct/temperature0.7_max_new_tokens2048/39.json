This implies that there is an impulse input at \\( t_1 \\), which can be represented as \\( \\delta(t - t_1) \\) in the context of differential equations.\n\n3. **Effect of Impulse**: When an impulse is applied at \\( t_1 \\), it affects the state of the system immediately after \\( t_1 \\). However, the effect of the impulse will decay over time due to the natural dynamics of the system described by the differential equation.\n\n4. **Laplace Transform Analysis**: Applying the Laplace transform to the differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   s^2 Y(s) + Y(s) = G(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( Y(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( y(t) \\) and \\( G(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\).

It transforms the differential equation into an algebraic equation, making it easier to solve. However, for the purpose of this problem, we need to consider how the Laplace transform affects our understanding of causality.\n\n3. **Causal Inference**: Causality in this context means that the state of the system at any time \\( t_2 > t_1 \\) should be influenced only by the information available up to time \\( t_1 \\).
