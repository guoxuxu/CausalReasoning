This is done by convolving \\( f(t) \\) with \\( h(t) \\), resulting in \\( g(t) = (h * f)(t) \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the properties and relationships involved:\n\n- The transfer function \\( H(s) \\) in the frequency domain corresponds to the impulse response \\( h(t) \\) in the time domain. Specifically, \\( H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\} \\).\n- When a signal \\( f(t) \\) is filtered in the time domain using \\( h(t) \\), it results in the convolution \\( g(t) = (h * f)(t) \\).\n- In the frequency domain, the effect of filtering is multiplication of the input's frequency response by the filter's transfer function. So, \\( G(s) = H(s)F(s) \\) represents the same operation.\n\nGiven that the inverse Laplace Transform of \\( G(s) \\) is \\( g(t) \\), and the convolution in the time domain with \\( h(t) \\) also results in \\( g(t) \\), we can conclude that both methods yield the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To address this question, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation**: The function \\( f(t) \\) is transformed into the frequency domain using the Laplace Transform, resulting in \\( F(s) \\).\n2. **Filtering in Frequency Domain**: The signal \\( F(s) \\) is then multiplied by the transfer function \\( H(s) \\) to get \\( G(s) = H(s)F(s) \\). This multiplication corresponds to a convolution in the time domain.\n3. **Inverse Transformation**: The inverse Laplace Transform of \\( G(s) \\) yields \\( g(t) \\).\n4. **Time Domain Filtering**: If we were to filter \\( f(t) \\) directly in the time domain using the impulse response \\( h(t) \\) of \\( H(s) \\), the result would be the convolution of \\( f(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\).\n\nThe key point here is that the multiplication of two functions in the frequency domain (i.e., \\( H(s)F(s) \\)) corresponds to the convolution of their respective time-domain counterparts. Therefore, the inverse Laplace Transform of \\( G(s) \\) should indeed yield the same result as convolving \\( f(t) \\) with \\( h(t) \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is \"Yes\".\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
