The Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\) is \\(sU(x,s) - u(x,0)\\), where \\(U(x,s)\\) is the Laplace transform of \\(u(x,t)\\).

The Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\) is \\(sU(x,s) - u(x,0)\\), where \\(U(x,s)\\) is the Laplace transform of \\(u(x,t)\\) and \\(s\\) is the Laplace variable.
