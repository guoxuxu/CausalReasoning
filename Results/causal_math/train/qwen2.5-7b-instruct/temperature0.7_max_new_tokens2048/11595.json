To analyze this, let's consider what happens when we apply the filter \\( h \\) in the Fourier domain. The Fourier transform of the filtered signal is \\( \\mathcal{F}(Mv) * h \\).

This transforms the vector from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Filter Application**: An intervention applying a filter \\( h(v) \\) in the Fourier domain is introduced.
