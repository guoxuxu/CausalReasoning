However, the inverse Laplace transform is not unique unless there are no poles on the imaginary axis and the region of convergence is specified. For \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i} \\), the inverse Laplace transform is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{it}\n   \\]\n   This is valid for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness Consideration**: The uniqueness of the inverse Laplace transform depends on the region of convergence and the nature of the poles. In this case, the function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) is uniquely determined by its Laplace transform \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i} \\) within the appropriate region of convergence.\n\nGiven the above steps, we can conclude that with the correct region of convergence and no other functions having the same Laplace transform in that region, we can uniquely determine the original function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To address this question, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Function**: The function given is \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\). This is a complex exponential function, which is periodic with period \\(2\\pi\\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Definition**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), substituting \\( z(t) \\) into the Laplace transform formula gives:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{it} \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(i-s)t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluating the Integral**: To evaluate the integral, we need to consider the condition for convergence. The integral converges if the real part of \\( s \\) (denoted as Re(s)) is greater than 1. Assuming Re(s) > 1, the integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(i-s)t}}{i-s} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{s-i}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Reversing the Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform is used to convert \\( Z(s) \\) back to \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Z(s)\\}\n   \\]\n   For \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\), the inverse Laplace transform is known to be:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s-i} \\right\\} = e^{it}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Determination**: Given that the Laplace transform \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\) uniquely corresponds to the original function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), we can infer that under the conditions where the Laplace transform exists and is unique, we can indeed determine the original function \\( z(t) \\) from \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that with the given Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) and the knowledge that it corresponds to the function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), we can uniquely determine the original function in the time domain without any additional information.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
