The Fourier Transform of \\( e^{az} \\) (for real \\( a \\)) involves a delta function, but here we have \\( e^z \\) which complicates this significantly.\n\n5. **Eigenfunction Condition**:\n   - An eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform satisfies \\( F[g(z)] = \\lambda g(z) \\).\n   - Generally, functions like \\( e^{i\\alpha z} \\) or \\( e^{-\\beta |z|} \\) can be eigenfunctions, but \\( e^z \\) does not fit this pattern in the context of the Fourier Transform over the entire complex plane.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the nature of the Fourier Transform and the form of \\( e^z \\), it is unlikely that \\( g(z) = f(z) \\cdot e^z \\) will be an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the resulting function after applying the transformation \\(g(z) = f(z)e^z\\) will be an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform operator \\(F\\), let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: Let \\(f(z)\\) be an analytic function of the complex variable \\(z\\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The function \\(f(z)\\) is transformed into \\(g(z) = f(z)e^z\\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Application**: We need to apply the Fourier Transform \\(F\\) to \\(g(z)\\). The Fourier Transform of a function \\(h(z)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(h(z)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(x) e^{-2\\pi i x t} dx\n   \\]\n   Applying this to \\(g(z)\\):\n   \\[\n   F(g(z)) = F(f(z)e^z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)e^x e^{-2\\pi i x t} dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x)e^{x(1-2\\pi i t)} dx\n   \\]\n\n4. **Eigenfunction Condition**: A function \\(h(z)\\) is an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform if there exists a scalar \\(\\lambda\\) such that:\n   \\[\n   F(h(z)) = \\lambda h(z)\n   \\]\n   For our case, we need to check if \\(F(g(z))\\) can be written in the form \\(\\lambda g(z)\\).\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - The expression for \\(F(g(z))\\) involves an integral of \\(f(x)\\) multiplied by a complex exponential.\n   - The term \\(e^{x(1-2\\pi i t)}\\) is not a simple scaling factor like \\(\\lambda\\), but rather a phase shift and growth/decay factor depending on \\(x\\).\n   - Therefore, it is unlikely that the result of the Fourier Transform can be expressed as a simple scalar multiple of \\(g(z)\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the resulting function after the transformation \\(g(z) = f(z)e^z\\) is not an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform operator \\(F\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with an analytic function \\( f(z) \\).\n\n2. **Transformation 1 - Multiplication by \\( e^z \\)**: \n   - This results in a new function \\( g(z) = f(z) \\cdot e^z \\).\n   \n3. **Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier Transform \\( F \\) is a linear operator that transforms functions from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n   - For a function \\( h(z) \\), its Fourier Transform \\( F(h(z)) \\) can be expressed in terms of an integral involving \\( h(z) \\) and a complex exponential.\n\n4. **Applying Fourier Transform to \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   - We need to determine if \\( g(z) \\) is an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform operator \\( F \\).\n   - An eigenfunction of a linear operator satisfies the equation \\( F(h(z)) = \\lambda h(z) \\) for some scalar \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - Let's consider the form of \\( g(z) \\): \\( g(z) = f(z) \\cdot e^z \\).\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( g(z) \\) would involve integrating \\( g(z) \\cdot e^{-ikz} \\) over all \\( z \\).\n   - The presence of \\( e^z \\) complicates the integration significantly, and it is not generally true that multiplying by \\( e^z \\) will result in a function that remains an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the Fourier Transform of \\( g(z) \\) does not generally simplify to a scaled version of \\( g(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\) is unlikely to be an eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform operator \\( F \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
