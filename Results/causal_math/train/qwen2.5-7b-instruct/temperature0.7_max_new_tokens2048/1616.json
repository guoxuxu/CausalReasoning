The solution to the PDE using the Laplace transform would typically involve solving for \\(u(x,t)\\) in terms of \\(s\\) and then applying the inverse Laplace transform to get back to the time domain.\n\n5. **Fourier Transform Consideration**: The Fourier transform involves spatial frequencies rather than time.
