    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Integral Transform**: The integral transform \\( I(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) involves an exponential decay factor \\( e^{-st} \\) multiplied by the function \\( f(t) = e^{At} \\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\( f(t) \\) into the Integral**: \n   \\[\n   I(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{At} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(A-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Analyze the Impact of Increasing \\( s \\)**:\n   - When \\( s \\) increases, the exponent \\((A - s)\\) in the integrand becomes more negative (since \\( s \\) is subtracted from \\( A \\)).\n   - If \\( A \\) is a complex number, increasing \\( s \\) will shift the real part of the exponent to a more negative value.\n   - For the integral to converge, the real part of the exponent must be negative.
