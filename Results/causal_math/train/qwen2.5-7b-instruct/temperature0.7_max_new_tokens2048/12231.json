This depends on the specific forms of the operations and their effects in the Laplace domain. For the operation \\( g(t) = t f(t) \\), we have a clear transformation rule \\( G(s) = -\\frac{dF(s)}{ds} \\). However, without additional information about other possible transformations \\( h(t) \\), it's not always possible to uniquely determine which operations were applied solely based on \\( H(s) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While the operation \\( g(t) = t f(t) \\) has a clear and unique effect in the Laplace domain, other potential operations could result in similar or different transformations, making it difficult to precisely determine all operations applied to \\( f(t) \\) just by analyzing \\( H(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
