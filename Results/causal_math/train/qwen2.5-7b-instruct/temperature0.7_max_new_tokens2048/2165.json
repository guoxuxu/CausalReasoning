  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( f(z) \\\\) fundamentally modifies the function. Specifically, transforming \\\\( e^{iωt} \\\\) by \\\\( f(z) = z^n \\\\) leads to \\\\( (e^{iωt})^n = e^{inωt} \\\\), which alters the frequency of oscillation. Therefore, the behavior at time T will differ from merely evolving \\\\( z(t) \\\\) without the transformation, due to the change in frequency.",
