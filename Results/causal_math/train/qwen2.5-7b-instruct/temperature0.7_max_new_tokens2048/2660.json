This means that the control modifies each component of \\(z\\) independently.\n\n3. **Effect of Control**: When the control \\(g(z) = Dz\\) is applied, it adds a deterministic component to the system dynamics.

However, the application of control does not change the underlying dynamics of the system (i.e., the operator \\(L\\)) but rather changes the state trajectory based on the current state at the moment of control application.\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**: At time \\(T\\), the final state of the system depends on both the initial conditions, the linear dynamics \\(L\\), and the noise \\(\\eta(t)\\). The control operation, while affecting the state at the exact moment of application, does not leave a clear, distinguishable signature in the final state that would allow us to pinpoint exactly when the control was applied without additional information.\n\n5. **Noise Influence**: The presence of noise \\(\\eta(t)\\) further complicates the identification of specific events in the system's evolution.
