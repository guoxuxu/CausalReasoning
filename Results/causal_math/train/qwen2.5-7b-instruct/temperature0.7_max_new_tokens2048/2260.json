    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System:**\n   - The original system is described by \\( Z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} X(s) \\, ds \\).\n   - An external control \\( u(t) \\) modifies \\( X(t) \\) to \\( X_u(t) = X(t) + u(t) \\).\n   - The new system with control is then \\( Z_u(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} X_u(s) \\, ds \\).\n\n2. **Expressing the New System:**\n   - Substituting \\( X_u(s) = X(s) + u(s) \\) into the integral equation for \\( Z_u(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     Z_u(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} (X(s) + u(s)) \\, ds\n     \\]\n   - This can be split into two integrals:\n     \\[\n     Z_u(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} X(s) \\, ds + \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} u(s) \\, ds\n     \\]\n   - Recognizing that the first term is the original \\( Z(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     Z_u(t) = Z(t) + \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} u(s) \\, ds\n     \\]\n\n3. **Given Information:**\n   - We know \\( Z(T) \\) after the control application.\n   - We need to determine if we can uniquely determine \\( u(t) \\) from \\( Z(T) \\).\n\n4. **Analysis:**\n   - From the equation \\( Z_u(T) = Z(T) + \\int_0^T e^{A(T-s)} u(s) \\, ds \\), we see that \\( Z(T) \\) includes both the original \\( Z(T) \\) and the contribution from \\( u(t) \\).\n   - The term \\( \\int_0^T e^{A(T-s)} u(s) \\, ds \\) is a convolution of \\( u(t) \\) with the kernel \\( e^{A(T-t)} \\).\n   - In general, a single point value \\( Z(T) \\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the entire function \\( u(t) \\). The convolution operation mixes the contributions of \\( u(t) \\) over the entire interval \\([0, T]\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional information about \\( u(t) \\) or constraints on its form, it is not feasible to determine the exact external control \\( u(t) \\) solely from \\( Z(T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can uniquely identify the external control \\( u(t) \\) from the final value \\( Z(T) \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the System Dynamics**:\n   - The original system is described by \\( Z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} X(s) \\, ds \\).\n   - With the introduction of the external control \\( u(t) \\), the new state function becomes \\( X_u(t) = X(t) + u(t) \\).\n   - The transformed system dynamics become \\( Z_u(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} X_u(s) \\, ds = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} (X(s) + u(s)) \\, ds \\).\n\n2. **Final State Analysis**:\n   - We know that after applying the control, the final state is given by \\( Z(T) \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( Z(T) = \\int_0^T e^{A(T-s)} (X(s) + u(s)) \\, ds \\).\n   - This can be split into two integrals: \\( Z(T) = \\int_0^T e^{A(T-s)} X(s) \\, ds + \\int_0^T e^{A(T-s)} u(s) \\, ds \\).\n   - Recognize that the first term is the original \\( Z(T) \\) without control, and the second term is the effect of the control \\( u(t) \\).\n\n3. **Isolating the Control Effect**:\n   - Let \\( Z_{\\text{original}}(T) = \\int_0^T e^{A(T-s)} X(s) \\, ds \\) be the original \\( Z(T) \\) without control.\n   - Then, \\( Z(T) = Z_{\\text{original}}(T) + \\int_0^T e^{A(T-s)} u(s) \\, ds \\).\n   - To isolate \\( u(t) \\), we would need to subtract \\( Z_{\\text{original}}(T) \\) from \\( Z(T) \\), but \\( Z_{\\text{original}}(T) \\) itself is not directly observable unless we have information about \\( X(t) \\) without control.\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Control Identification**:\n   - Without additional information about \\( X(t) \\) or specific properties of \\( A \\) and \\( u(t) \\), the integral equation for \\( Z(T) \\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\( u(t) \\) from \\( Z(T) \\) alone.\n   - The integral equation is linear in \\( u(t) \\), but solving for \\( u(t) \\) requires knowing \\( X(t) \\), which is modified by \\( u(t) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the complexity and the lack of additional constraints on \\( X(t) \\) and \\( u(t) \\), it is not generally feasible to determine the exact external control \\( u(t) \\) solely from \\( Z(T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
