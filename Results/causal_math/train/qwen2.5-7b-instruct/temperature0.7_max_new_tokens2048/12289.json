However, if \\( H(\\omega) \\) varies or is unknown, there could be multiple signals \\( x(t) \\) that would produce the same \\( G(\\omega) \\).\n\nGiven these considerations, if \\( H(\\omega) \\) is not known or varies, the original signal \\( x(t) \\) cannot be uniquely determined from the observed response \\( G(\\omega) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation**: The signal \\( x(t) \\) is transformed into the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform \\( F(x)(\\omega) \\). This transformation maps the time-domain signal into its frequency components.\n\n2. **Filtering**: The frequency response \\( F(x)(\\omega) \\) is then passed through a filter with transfer function \\( H(\\omega) \\). This introduces potential alterations to the frequency components of the signal, such as amplification, attenuation, or phase shifts.\n\n3. **Observation**: The result of the filtering process, \\( H(\\omega) \\cdot F(x)(\\omega) \\), is observed. This is the observed frequency response after the filtering.\n\n4. **Reversibility**: To determine if the original signal \\( x(t) \\) can be uniquely recovered from the observed frequency response, we need to consider whether the filtering process is invertible. If \\( H(\\omega) \\) is a non-zero function for all frequencies (i.e., no zero-padding in the frequency domain), then the filtering process is generally invertible.\n\n5. **Inverse Filtering**: In theory, if \\( H(\\omega) \\) does not introduce any zero-amplitude frequencies, we could potentially recover \\( F(x)(\\omega) \\) by dividing the observed response by \\( H(\\omega) \\): \n   \\[\n   F(x)(\\omega) = \\frac{\\text{observed\\_response}}{H(\\omega)}\n   \\]\n   Then, applying the inverse Fourier Transform would give us back \\( x(t) \\).\n\n6. **Practical Considerations**: In practice, filters often have a frequency response that includes zeros (e.g., due to anti-aliasing filters or other design choices). When \\( H(\\omega) = 0 \\) at some frequencies, these frequencies cannot be recovered directly from the observed response. Additionally, noise and other imperfections in the observation can further complicate the recovery process.\n\nGiven these considerations, the ability to uniquely determine the original signal \\( x(t) \\) depends on the specific form of the filter \\( H(\\omega) \\). If \\( H(\\omega) \\) has zeros, then the original signal cannot be uniquely determined without additional information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
