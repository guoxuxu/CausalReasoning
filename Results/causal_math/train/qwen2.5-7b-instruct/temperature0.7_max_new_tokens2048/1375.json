    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a system described by the Laplace transform \\( G(s) \\) of the function \\( g(t) \\).\n\n2. **Convolution with Kernel \\( h(t) \\)**: The effect of applying a convolution transformation with kernel \\( h(t) \\) can be represented as \\( (g * h)(t) \\). Its Laplace transform is \\( G(s)H(s) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention with New Kernel \\( j(t) \\)**: At a specific time \\( t_1 \\), we apply a new kernel \\( j(t) \\) with Laplace transform \\( J(s) \\). This intervention changes the system response.\n\n4. **Effect of Intervention**: To understand if the Laplace transform of the resultant function depends only on \\( J(s) \\) and not on the previous kernel \\( H(s) \\), we need to consider the nature of convolution and the Laplace transform properties.\n\n5. **Laplace Transform of Convolution**: The Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions \\( f(t) \\) and \\( k(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t) * k(t)\\}(s) = F(s)K(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( F(s) \\) and \\( K(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( f(t) \\) and \\( k(t) \\), respectively.\n\n6. **Application of New Kernel**: If we apply the new kernel \\( j(t) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), the effect can be modeled as a convolution with a shifted version of \\( j(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   (g * j_{t_1})(t) = g(t) * j(t - t_1)\n   \\]\n   where \\( j_{t_1}(t) = j(t - t_1) \\).\n\n7. **Laplace Transform of Shifted Kernel**: The Laplace transform of a shifted function \\( j(t - t_1) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{j(t - t_1)\\}(s) = e^{-s t_1}J(s)\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of the resultant function after applying the new kernel is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{(g * j_{t_1})(t)\\}(s) = G(s) \\cdot e^{-s t_1}J(s)\n   \\]\n   This expression clearly shows that the Laplace transform of the resultant function depends on both \\( J(s) \\) and the previous kernel \\( H(s) \\) through \\( G(s) \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the Laplace transform of the resultant function does depend on both \\( J(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\), which includes information about the previous kernel \\( H(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

However, the Laplace transform of the convolution up to any point \\( t \\) depends only on the current kernel \\( j(t) \\) from that point onward.\n\n3. **Effect of Previous Kernel \\( H(s) \\)**: The previous kernel \\( h(t) \\) with Laplace transform \\( H(s) \\) affects the system up until \\( t_1 \\).

This results in a new function \\( (g * h)(t) \\) with Laplace transform \\( G(s)H(s) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the kernel is altered to a new kernel \\( j(t) \\) with Laplace transform \\( J(s) \\).
