    "To determine if we can deduce the original function \\( z(t) \\) from the Laplace transformed system function \\( L(z)(s) \\) given the provided information, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original System Function**:\n   \\[ z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\]\n   Here, \\( A \\) is a complex constant, and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Definition**:\n   \\[ L(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\]\n\n3. **Substitute the Original Function into the Laplace Transform**:\n   Substitute \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\) into the Laplace transform definition:\n   \\[ L(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{At} z_0 \\, dt \\]\n   Simplify the exponent:\n   \\[ L(z)(s) = z_0 \\int_0^\\infty e^{(A-s)t} \\, dt \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   The integral \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{(A-s)t} \\, dt \\) converges if the real part of \\( A - s \\) is negative (i.e., Re\\((A - s) < 0\\)). Assuming this condition holds:\n   \\[ \\int_0^\\infty e^{(A-s)t} \\, dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(A-s)t}}{A-s} \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{s-A} \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[ L(z)(s) = z_0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{s-A} \\]\n\n5. **Inversion of the Laplace Transform**:\n   To find \\( z(t) \\) from \\( L(z)(s) \\):\n   \\[ L(z)(s) = \\frac{z_0}{s-A} \\]\n   The inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s-A} \\) is \\( e^{At} \\). Thus:\n   \\[ z(t) = z_0 e^{At} \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Given \\( L(z)(s) = \\frac{z_0}{s-A} \\), we can indeed deduce the original function \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\) without needing additional information about \\( A \\) and \\( z_0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
