Without \\( h(t) \\), we cannot determine \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) \\), and thus we cannot isolate \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t) + h(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, given only the Laplace transform of the modified function \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t) + h(t)\\}(s) \\) and not \\( h(t) \\), it is impossible to uniquely determine the original function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given the Laplace transform of a function \\( z(t) \\) and a modified function \\( z(t) + h(t) \\). We need to determine if we can uniquely recover \\( z(t) \\) from its Laplace transform, given only the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) + h(t) \\) and not \\( h(t) \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Properties**: Recall that the Laplace transform of a sum of functions is the sum of their individual Laplace transforms:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t) + h(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) + \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Given Information**:\n   - We know \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t) + h(t)\\}(s) \\).\n   - We know \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\n4. **Isolating \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) \\)**:\n   - From the property mentioned above, we can express \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) \\) as:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t) + h(t)\\}(s) - \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s)\n     \\]\n   - This equation allows us to find \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) \\) if we have both \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t) + h(t)\\}(s) \\) and \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\n5. **Recovering \\( h(t) \\)**:\n   - Knowing \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) \\), we could theoretically use the inverse Laplace transform to find \\( h(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{\\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s)\\}\n     \\]\n   - However, without additional information about \\( h(t) \\), there could be multiple functions \\( h(t) \\) that produce the same Laplace transform.\n\n6. **Uniqueness of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - If we know \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\) and can determine \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) \\), we can subtract these to find \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\). But knowing \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\) alone does not uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) because many different functions can have the same Laplace transform.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given only \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t) + h(t)\\}(s) \\) and \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) without additional information about \\( h(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given the Laplace transform of a function \\( z(t) \\) and the Laplace transform of a modified function \\( z(t) + h(t) \\). We need to determine if we can find the original function \\( z(t) \\) from these transforms without knowing \\( h(t) \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Properties**:\n   - The Laplace transform of a sum is the sum of the transforms: \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t) + h(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) + \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) \\).\n   - This means that \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t) + h(t)\\}(s) = Z(s) + H(s) \\), where \\( Z(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\) and \\( H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Problem**:\n   - Knowing \\( Z(s) + H(s) \\) does not allow us to uniquely determine \\( Z(s) \\) without additional information about \\( H(s) \\).\n   - Without knowing \\( H(s) \\), there are infinitely many possible functions \\( z(t) \\) that could correspond to a given \\( Z(s) + H(s) \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \\( H(s) \\) is unknown, we cannot isolate \\( Z(s) \\) from \\( Z(s) + H(s) \\) alone.\n   - Therefore, it is not possible to determine the original function \\( z(t) \\) solely from the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) + h(t) \\) and the transform itself.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
