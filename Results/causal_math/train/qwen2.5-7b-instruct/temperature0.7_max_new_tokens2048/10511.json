Since the signal \\( z(t) \\) is altered after \\( t_1 \\), the Fourier transform will reflect this change. Specifically, the presence of \\( e^{Ct}y \\) introduces new frequency components not present in the original system.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given that the Fourier transform is sensitive to the entire time-domain representation of the signal, the change in the system after \\( t_1 \\) will indeed alter the spectrum of the Fourier transform at every frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"

We need to consider how this affects the Fourier transform.\n\n3. **New Fourier Transform**:\n   The new Fourier transform for \\( t > t_1 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} (e^{At}x + e^{Ct}y) dt\n   \\]\n   This also splits into two parts:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{At}x \\, dt + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{Ct}y \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - The first part of both Fourier transforms remains the same since it does not depend on the specific form of \\( y \\).\n   - The second part changes because the exponential term \\( e^{Bt} \\) is replaced by \\( e^{Ct} \\).\n\n5. **Spectrum Change**:\n   Since the second part of the Fourier transform involves a different exponential term \\( e^{Ct} \\) compared to \\( e^{Bt} \\), the spectrum of the Fourier transform will generally change. The spectrum is determined by the frequency response of the system, which is altered by the change in the exponent.\n\nTherefore, the change from \\( e^{Bt} \\) to \\( e^{Ct} \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) will indeed change the spectrum of the Fourier transform \\( F(z) \\) at every frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Equation and Fourier Transform**:\n   - Original equation: \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\)\n   - Fourier transform: \\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt \\)\n\n2. **Effect of Changing Matrix B**:\n   - If we vary \\( B \\), it directly affects the term \\( e^{Bt}y \\) in the original equation.\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( e^{Bt}y \\) will be modified accordingly.\n   - Therefore, changing \\( B \\) will indeed change the spectrum of \\( F(z) \\).\n\n3. **Transformation Applied at Time \\( t_1 \\)**:\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), a transformation represented by matrix \\( C \\) is applied to \\( y \\).\n   - This changes the equation to \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Ct}y \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\).\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\), the equation remains \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\).\n\n4. **Fourier Transform Analysis**:\n   - The Fourier transform of the equation \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\) (for \\( t < t_1 \\)) will include contributions from both \\( e^{At}x \\) and \\( e^{Bt}y \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of the equation \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Ct}y \\) (for \\( t > t_1 \\)) will include contributions from \\( e^{At}x \\) and \\( e^{Ct}y \\).\n\n5. **Change in Spectrum**:\n   - Since the Fourier transform of \\( e^{Bt}y \\) and \\( e^{Ct}y \\) are different (as they involve different exponents), the overall spectrum of \\( F(z) \\) will be altered at every frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the application of the transformation represented by matrix \\( C \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) will indeed change the spectrum of the Fourier transform \\( F(z) \\) at every frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "To determine if the change from \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\) to \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Ct}y \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) affects the spectrum of the Fourier transform \\( F(z) \\) at every frequency \\( \\omega \\), let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Fourier Transform:**\n   - For the initial condition \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\), the Fourier transform \\( F(z) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} (e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y) \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - This can be split into two integrals:\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{At}x \\, dt + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{Bt}y \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - Each integral represents the Fourier transform of the corresponding term.\n\n2. **Change in Equation:**\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), the transformation represented by matrix \\( C \\) is applied to \\( y \\), changing the equation to \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Ct}y \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\).\n   - The Fourier transform after this change is:\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t_1} e^{-i\\omega t} (e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y) \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} (e^{At}x + e^{Ct}y) \\, dt\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparison of Fourier Transforms:**\n   - The first part of the integral remains unchanged as it corresponds to the period before \\( t_1 \\).\n   - The second part of the integral now includes \\( e^{Ct}y \\) instead of \\( e^{Bt}y \\):\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t_1} e^{-i\\omega t} (e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y) \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{At}x \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{Ct}y \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - The additional term \\( \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{Ct}y \\, dt \\) introduces a new component that was not present in the original Fourier transform.\n\n4. **Effect on Spectrum:**\n   - Since the additional term \\( \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{Ct}y \\, dt \\) introduces a new frequency content due to the different exponential growth rate \\( e^{Ct} \\), the spectrum of the Fourier transform will indeed change at every frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the change does affect the spectrum of the Fourier transform at every frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
