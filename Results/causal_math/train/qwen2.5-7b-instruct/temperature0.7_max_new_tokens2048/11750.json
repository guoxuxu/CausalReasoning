    "To determine whether the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the differential equation parameters A, B, C, D and not on M or N, let's analyze the given system step by step.\n\n1. **Initial System Dynamics**:\n   - The function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) is a complex representation of the real functions \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\).\n   - The differential equations for \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are:\n     \\[\n     \\dot{x} = Ax + By\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\n     \\]\n\n2. **Intervention by \\( K(z) \\)**:\n   - An intervention by the function \\( K(z) = e^{Nt}z \\) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\).
