However, without additional information about the exact form of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) before the intervention, we cannot uniquely determine which signal (either \\( x(t) \\) or \\( y(t) \\)) the cosine function was added to.\n\n3. **Indistinguishability Without Additional Information**: The presence of peaks at \\( \\omega_1 \\) and \\( \\omega_2 \\) does not provide enough information to distinguish whether the cosine function was added to \\( x(t) \\) or \\( y(t) \\). Both signals could independently have cosine components, or one could have a cosine component while the other does not.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot uniquely determine if a specific cosine function was added to \\( x(t) \\) or \\( y(t) \\) based solely on the observation of peaks in \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if a specific cosine function was added to \\(x(t)\\) or \\(y(t)\\) based on the observation of specific peaks in \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) at frequencies \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\), we need to consider the properties of the Fourier transform.\n\n1. **Fourier Transform of a Cosine Function**: \n   - The Fourier transform of a cosine function \\( \\cos(\\beta t) \\) results in two delta functions, one at \\( \\beta \\) and one at \\( -\\beta \\). Specifically, \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{\\cos(\\beta t)\\} = \\frac{\\pi}{i}[\\delta(\\omega - \\beta) - \\delta(\\omega + \\beta)] \\).\n\n2. **Implication for \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\)**:\n   - If a cosine function is added to \\(x(t)\\), it will contribute to the Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\) at the same frequency as the cosine.\n   - Similarly, if a cosine function is added to \\(y(t)\\), it will also contribute to the Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\) at the same frequency as the cosine.\n\n3. **Observation of Peaks**:\n   - The presence of peaks at specific frequencies \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) in \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) indicates the presence of cosine functions in either \\(x(t)\\), \\(y(t)\\), or both.\n   - However, these peaks alone do not specify whether the cosine function was added to \\(x(t)\\) or \\(y(t)\\). They only indicate that there is a contribution from a cosine function at those frequencies.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the given information, observing specific peaks in \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) at frequencies \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine if a specific cosine function was added to \\(x(t)\\) or \\(y(t)\\). There could be contributions from cosines in both \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\), or just one of them.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
