  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "The transformation alters the function from \\\\( t^2 \\\\) to \\\\( t^5 \\\\), significantly changing the outcome of the integral in the Laplace transform. Specifically, Laplace transform of \\\\( t^5 \\\\) differs from that of \\\\( t^2 \\\\) due to different powers of t contributing differently under the integration against \\\\( e^{-st} \\\\).
