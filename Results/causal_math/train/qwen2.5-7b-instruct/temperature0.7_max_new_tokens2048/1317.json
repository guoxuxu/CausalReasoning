Substituting \\( t = At \\) into the original function, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(At) = \\int_{0}^{At} e^{s(At)} \\, ds\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the exponent:\n   \\[\n   z(At) = \\int_{0}^{At} e^{As^t} \\, ds\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate at Time \\( T \\)**:\n   We need to evaluate \\( z(At) \\) at \\( t = T \\):\n   \\[\n   z(At) \\Big|_{t=T} = \\int_{0}^{AT} e^{As^T} \\, ds\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compare with Direct Integral Transformation**:\n   The direct integral transformation of \\( t = T \\) under the original definition is:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{st} \\, ds = \\frac{e^{sT} - 1}{s}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Consistency Check**:\n   For consistency, we need to check if:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{AT} e^{As^T} \\, ds = \\frac{e^{sT} - 1}{s}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Matrix Exponential**:\n   Since \\( A \\) is a constant matrix, \\( e^{As^T} \\) involves the matrix exponential function. However, the form of the integrand \\( e^{As^T} \\) does not simplify to \\( e^{st} \\) for any scalar \\( t \\) due to the nature of matrix exponentials. Therefore, the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{AT} e^{As^T} \\, ds \\) does not directly equate to \\( \\frac{e^{sT} - 1}{s} \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the transformed function \\( z(At) \\) evaluated at \\( t = T \\) does not remain consistent with the direct integral transformation of \\( t = T \\) under the original definition.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the function \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( T \\) is consistent with the direct integral transformation of \\( t = T \\) under the original definition after applying the linear transformation \\( t = At \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Original Function Definition**:\n   The original function is given by:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} \\, ds\n   \\]\n   To find \\( z(t) \\), we need to evaluate the integral:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{st} \\, ds = \\left[ \\frac{e^{st}}{s} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{e^{st} - 1}{s}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Linear Transformation**:\n   We introduce a linear transformation \\( t = At \\) where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix. This implies that \\( t \\) is now a vector and \\( A \\) is a matrix. For simplicity, let's assume \\( t \\) is a scalar for now and generalize later.\n\n3. **Transformed Function**:\n   If \\( t \\) is transformed to \\( t' = At \\), then we need to evaluate the integral with respect to the new variable \\( t' \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t') = \\int_{0}^{t'} e^{s t'} \\, dt'\n   \\]\n   Using the same steps as before, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(t') = \\int_{0}^{t'} e^{s t'} \\, dt' = \\left[ \\frac{e^{s t'}}{s} \\right]_0^{t'} = \\frac{e^{s t'} - 1}{s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Consistency Check**:\n   We need to check if the transformed function \\( z(t') \\) at \\( t' = T \\) is consistent with the direct integral transformation of \\( t = T \\) under the original definition. Since the transformation does not change the form of the integral, we have:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = \\frac{e^{s T} - 1}{s}\n   \\]\n   This is exactly the same as evaluating the original function at \\( t = T \\).\n\nTherefore, the function \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( T \\) is indeed consistent with the direct integral transformation of \\( t = T \\) under the original definition after applying the linear transformation \\( t = At \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
