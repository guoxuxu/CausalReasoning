    "To determine if we can fully recover the original function \\( w(u) \\) from \\( T[w](u) \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral Transformation**: The transformation \\( T[f](u) = \\int_C f(v)e^{-uv} dv \\) involves integrating a complex function \\( f(v) \\) over a contour \\( C \\) in the complex plane, multiplied by the exponential term \\( e^{-uv} \\).\n\n2. **Recovering \\( w(u) \\)**: We want to know if \\( T[w](u) \\) can uniquely determine \\( w(u) \\). This is essentially asking if the inverse operation exists and is unique.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Inverse Problem**: To recover \\( w(u) \\) from \\( T[w](u) \\), we would need an inversion formula that allows us to go from the transformed function back to the original function. A well-known example of such a transformation is the Laplace transform, which has an inverse Laplace transform.\n\n4. **Laplace Transform Context**: The integral transformation given is very similar to the Laplace transform, which is defined as \\( L[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt \\). For the Laplace transform, under certain conditions (like the function being piecewise continuous and of exponential order), the inverse Laplace transform can be used to recover the original function.\n\n5. **Contour Integration Consideration**: In our case, the contour \\( C \\) is not necessarily along the positive real axis but can be any contour in the complex plane. However, the essence of the problem remains similar to the Laplace transform when considering the properties of the integral.\n\n6. **Uniqueness and Conditions**: For the Laplace transform and its inversion, there are conditions under which the original function can be recovered uniquely. These conditions include the function being analytic within a certain region and satisfying certain growth conditions.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given the similarity to the Laplace transform and assuming appropriate conditions on \\( w(u) \\) and the contour \\( C \\), it is theoretically possible to recover \\( w(u) \\) from \\( T[w](u) \\) using an appropriate inversion formula.\n\nTherefore, with the right conditions and assumptions, we can indeed fully recover the original function \\( w(u) \\) from \\( T[w](u) \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**:\n   - The transformation \\( T \\) involves integrating the product of a function \\( f(v) \\) and \\( e^{-uv} \\) over a contour \\( C \\) in the complex plane.\n   - This is reminiscent of the Laplace transform when \\( f(v) = w(v) \\).\n\n2. **Inversion of the Laplace Transform**:\n   - The Laplace transform is a well-known integral transform that maps a function of time to a function of complex frequency.\n   - The inverse Laplace transform allows us to recover the original function from its Laplace transform.\n   - However, for the inverse to be unique, certain conditions (like the function being of exponential order) must be met.\n\n3. **Conditions for Unique Recovery**:\n   - For the Laplace transform and its inversion to work uniquely, the function \\( w(u) \\) must satisfy certain conditions.\n   - These conditions typically include the function being analytic in a right half-plane and satisfying an exponential bound.\n\n4. **Effect of the Contour C**:\n   - The choice of contour \\( C \\) can affect the properties of the transformed function.\n   - Different contours can lead to different results, especially if they cross singularities or branch cuts.\n\n5. **Recovery Without Additional Information**:\n   - Without additional information about \\( w(u) \\), such as its analyticity, boundedness, or specific form, it is not generally possible to uniquely determine \\( w(u) \\) from \\( T[w](u) \\).\n   - The inverse Laplace transform requires knowledge of the behavior of \\( w(u) \\) in the complex plane, which is not provided solely by the transformed function \\( T[w](u) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given only \\( T[w](u) \\) and no additional information about \\( w(u) \\), it is not possible to fully recover \\( w(u) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
