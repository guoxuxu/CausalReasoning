Since the system's behavior changes at \\( t_1 \\), the transformed function \\( h(z)(T) \\) will reflect this change, but it won't pinpoint exactly when the change occurred. The exact timing \\( t_1 \\) would require additional information beyond just the transformed value.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer to the question \"Can we determine precisely the time \\( t_1 \\) at which the intervention changing A to A' occurred?\" is no, because the integral transformation alone does not provide enough detail to pinpoint the exact moment of the intervention.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",

However, the integral transformation \\( h(z) \\) will integrate over the entire interval [0, T], meaning it will capture the effects of the system evolution before and after \\( t_1 \\).\n\nThe key point here is whether the change in \\( A \\) to \\( A' \\) can be isolated in the transformed function \\( h(z)(T) \\):\n\n- If the change in \\( A \\) is significant and abrupt enough, it might leave a detectable \"fingerprint\" in \\( h(z)(T) \\).\n- However, without additional information about the specific forms of \\( A \\), \\( A' \\), and the initial conditions, it's challenging to pinpoint \\( t_1 \\) exactly from \\( h(z)(T) \\) alone.\n\nGiven the complexity and the integration over the entire interval, it seems that determining \\( t_1 \\) precisely would require more than just observing \\( h(z)(T) \\).
