This means that if you have a function \\( z(t) \\), you can compute its Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\), and then apply the inverse Fourier transform to recover \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Requirements for Uniqueness**: For the Fourier transform to be uniquely invertible, the original function \\( z(t) \\) must satisfy certain conditions (e.g., it must be absolutely integrable over the entire time domain).

This means that multiple different time-domain signals could have the same frequency-domain representation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given only the transformed function \\( Z(\\omega) \\), we cannot uniquely determine the original function \\( z(t) \\) because many different \\( z(t) \\) could map to the same \\( Z(\\omega) \\).

Without knowing the phase information, reconstructing the exact original signal can be challenging.\n   - **Ambiguities in Time-Domain Representation**: There might be multiple time-domain signals that have the same frequency-domain representation due to ambiguities in the time-domain signal reconstruction.\n\n4. **Prior Details Matter**: To conclusively determine \\( z(t) \\) from \\( Z(\\omega) \\), we need at least some information about \\( z(t) \\) itself, such as initial conditions, boundary conditions, or specific properties of the signal (e.g., causality, smoothness).\n\nGiven these points, we cannot conclusively determine the original complex function \\( z(t) \\) from the transformed domain \\( Z(\\omega) \\) without knowing any prior details about \\( z(t) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

This means the integral of the squared magnitude of \\( z(t) \\) over all time must be finite:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |z(t)|^2 dt < \\infty\n   \\]\n\n4. **Information Loss**: If no additional information about \\( z(t) \\) is provided, such as its specific form or constraints, there might be ambiguity in recovering \\( z(t) \\) exactly due to potential non-uniqueness issues.
