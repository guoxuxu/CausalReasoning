    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Function**: The function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) evolves over time according to the differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\). This means that both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to linear differential equations with constant coefficients, which implies they can be expressed as exponential functions of time multiplied by some constants (eigenvalues of A and B).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation \\( T \\)**: The transformation \\( T \\) is defined as \\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^{Cs}z(s) ds \\).
