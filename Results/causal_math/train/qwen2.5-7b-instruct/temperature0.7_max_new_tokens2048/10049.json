    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE**: The given PDE is \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\), which is known as the inviscid Burgers' equation. This equation describes how the velocity field evolves over time.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: When we apply the Fourier transform to the velocity field \\( u(x, t) \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ikx} u(x, t) dx\n   \\]\n   This transforms the spatial variable \\( x \\) into the wavenumber domain \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Transformed Equation**: To understand the behavior of the Fourier transform in the wavenumber domain, we need to see how the Fourier transform of the PDE behaves. By applying the Fourier transform to the PDE, we use the property that the Fourier transform of a derivative is a multiplication by the wavenumber \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}(u)}{\\partial t} + \\mathcal{F}\\left(u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) = 0\n   \\]\n   Using the convolution theorem, we can rewrite the term involving the product \\( u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\left(u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) = -i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\mathcal{F}(u)\n   \\]\n   Thus, the transformed equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}(u)}{\\partial t} - i k \\mathcal{F}(u) = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Transformed Equation**: The transformed equation is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time \\( t \\) with respect to the wavenumber \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}(u)}{\\partial t} = i k \\mathcal{F}(u)\n   \\]\n   Solving this ODE with the initial condition \\( \\mathcal{F}(u)(k, 0) \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = \\mathcal{F}(u)(k, 0) e^{i k t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Interpreting the Result**: The solution indicates that the Fourier transform of the velocity field at time \\( t \\) is simply the initial Fourier transform multiplied by a phase factor \\( e^{i k t} \\).
