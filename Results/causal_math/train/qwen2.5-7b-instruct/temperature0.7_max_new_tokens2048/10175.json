This integral can be solved using the formula for the Fourier transform of a complex exponential:\n   \\[ F'(ω') = \\frac{1}{iω - α - iω'} \\cdot \\left[ e^{(iω-α-iω')t} \\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\]\n\n5. Evaluating the limits, we see that the integral converges only if \\( ω' = ω - α \\). In this case, the result is:\n   \\[ F'(ω') = \\frac{2π}{α} \\delta(ω' - (ω - α)) \\]\n   where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n6. The presence of \\( \\alpha \\) shifts the peak of the Fourier transform from \\( ω \\) to \\( ω - α \\).\n\nTherefore, the transform \\( F'(ω) \\) will not show a peak exactly at \\( ω \\), but rather at \\( ω - α \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
