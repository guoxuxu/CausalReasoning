    "To analyze whether the state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State and Time Evolution:**\n   - The initial state is \\( z_0 \\).\n   - The state evolves over time according to \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( h(z) = e^{Bt}z \\):**\n   - This transformation modifies the state at any time \\( t \\) by multiplying it with \\( e^{Bt} \\).\n   - However, since we are considering the state after applying \\( h(z) \\) and then \\( k(z) \\), we need to determine the net effect on the state.\n\n3. **Transformation \\( k(z) = e^{Ct}z \\):**\n   - This transformation further modifies the state at any time \\( t \\) by multiplying it with \\( e^{Ct} \\).\n\n4. **Applying Both Transformations:**\n   - If both transformations \\( h(z) \\) and \\( k(z) \\) are applied at time \\( t_1 \\), the state at \\( t_1 \\) would be modified as follows:\n     \\[\n     z(t_1) = e^{Bt_1}e^{At_1}z_0\n     \\]\n   - Then, applying \\( k(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     z(t_1 + \\Delta t) = e^{C(t_1 + \\Delta t)}e^{Bt_1}e^{At_1}z_0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final State \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\):**\n   - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the state evolves according to the combined effect of \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\):\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}e^{Ct_1}e^{Bt_1}z_0\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the expression:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}e^{Ct_1 + Bt_1}z_0\n     \\]\n\n6. **Dependency on Matrices \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\):**\n   - The final state \\( z(T) \\) clearly depends on all three matrices \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\).
