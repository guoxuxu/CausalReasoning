    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The initial condition for \\(z(t)\\) is governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = i\\omega z\\). This implies that without any transformations, \\(z(t)\\) would evolve as:\n   \\[ z(t) = z(t_0) e^{i\\omega (t - t_0)} \\]\n   where \\(t_0\\) is some initial time.\n\n2. **Transformation by \\(f(z)\\)**: The transformation \\(f(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z\\) modifies the amplitude and phase of \\(z(t)\\). Applying this transformation to the solution of the differential equation gives:\n   \\[ z(t) = z(t_0) e^{i\\omega (t - t_0)} e^{\\alpha t} \\]\n\n3. **Intervention by \\(g(z)\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), a new transformation \\(g(z) = e^{\\beta t}z\\) is applied. This means that from \\(t_1\\) onwards, the evolution of \\(z(t)\\) is modified by:\n   \\[ z(t) = z(t_1) e^{i\\omega (t - t_1)} e^{\\beta t} \\]\n   where \\(z(t_1)\\) is the state of \\(z\\) just after the application of \\(g(z)\\).\n\n4. **State at Time \\(T > t_1\\)**: To find the state \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\), we need to consider the evolution starting from \\(t_1\\):\n   \\[ z(T) = z(t_1) e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} e^{\\beta T} \\]\n   Since \\(z(t_1)\\) itself is a function of the previous transformations, it includes both \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\alpha\\):\n   \\[ z(t_1) = z(t_0) e^{i\\omega (t_1 - t_0)} e^{\\alpha t_1} \\]\n\n5. **Final Expression for \\(z(T)\\)**: Substituting \\(z(t_1)\\) into the expression for \\(z(T)\\):\n   \\[ z(T) = z(t_0) e^{i\\omega (t_1 - t_0)} e^{\\alpha t_1} e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} e^{\\beta T} \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[ z(T) = z(t_0) e^{i\\omega (T - t_0)} e^{\\alpha t_1} e^{\\beta T} \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The state \\(z(T)\\) depends on both \\(\\omega\\) and the constants \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Specifically, the term \\(e^{\\alpha t_1}\\) shows that \\(\\alpha\\) affects the amplitude of \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t_1\\), which then influences the state \\(z(T)\\).\n\nTherefore, the state \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) does depend on \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
