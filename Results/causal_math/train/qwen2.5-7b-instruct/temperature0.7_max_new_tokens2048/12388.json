This is a complex exponential function where \\( t \\) is time and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-st} dt\n   \\]\n   For our function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\):\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{it}e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i(t-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Integral**: To solve this integral, we recognize that for \\( s > 0 \\) (which is typical for the Laplace transform), the integral converges. The integral can be evaluated using the properties of complex exponentials and integration techniques. However, it's important to note that the Laplace transform of \\( e^{it} \\) does not exist in the usual sense because \\( e^{it} \\) is not absolutely integrable over \\([0, \\infty)\\).\n\n4. **Analyzing the Transform**: Despite the above, if we consider the principal value or use distributions (generalized functions), we can find that the Laplace transform of \\( e^{it} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = -\\frac{1}{s-1}\n   \\]\n   This result comes from the known Laplace transform pair and the properties of complex exponentials.\n\n5. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform of \\( Z(s) = -\\frac{1}{s-1} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{t}\n   \\]\n   This is true for \\( t > 0 \\), but for our original function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), the inverse Laplace transform does not directly give us back \\( e^{it} \\) due to the nature of the original function and the transform.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the analysis, the function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) does not have a standard Laplace transform that maps back to itself upon inverse transformation. The result after applying the Laplace transform and then the inverse Laplace transform does not precisely match the original function.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
