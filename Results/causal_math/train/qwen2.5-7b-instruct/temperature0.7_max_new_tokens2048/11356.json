Knowing \\(z(T)\\) gives us \\(z(T) = e^{wT}z(0)\\). This relationship is unique for each \\(w\\) and \\(T\\), meaning that if we only know \\(z(T)\\), we cannot distinguish between different values of \\(w\\) without additional information about \\(z(0)\\).\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can determine \"precisely which transformations (whether \\(g(z)\\), \\(h(z)\\), or both)\" were used. Since \\(h(z)\\) is not defined in the problem and there is no indication of any other transformations apart from \\(g(z)\\), we can infer that if \\(z(T)\\) is given, we can only determine the effect of \\(g(z)\\) and not any other hypothetical \\(h(z)\\).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the transformation \\(g(z)\\) alone, we cannot determine if \\(h(z)\\) was used or not. The problem statement does not provide enough information to distinguish between the use of \\(g(z)\\) and \\(h(z)\\) or both.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
