This transformation does not directly influence the state after \\(t_1\\), but it affects how the state evolves up to \\(t_1\\).\n\n3. **Intervention with \\(H(x)\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), an intervention is applied using the operational matrix function \\(H(x) = e^{Ft}x\\). This means the state at \\(t_1\\) is modified to \\(x(t_1) = e^{Ft_1}x(t_1)\\).\n\n4. **Post-intervention Evolution**: After \\(t_1\\), the state continues to evolve according to \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\).

Since the evolution post-intervention is still governed by \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), the final state will be influenced by \\(D\\).
