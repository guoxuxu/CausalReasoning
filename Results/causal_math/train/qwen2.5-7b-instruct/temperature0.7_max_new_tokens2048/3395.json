This means that the new function becomes \\(g(t)h(t)\\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of the Product**: The Laplace transform of the product \\(g(t)h(t)\\) can be found using the time-shifting property of the Laplace transform. If \\(L[g(t)](s) = G(s)\\), then \\(L[g(t-t_0)h(t-t_0)](s) = e^{-s t_0}G(s)\\). However, since \\(h(t) = e^{ct}\\) is not a time-shifted function but rather a multiplying factor, we use the frequency shifting property instead.\n\n4. **Frequency Shifting Property**: The frequency shifting property states that if \\(L[g(t)](s) = G(s)\\), then \\(L[e^{ct}g(t)](s) = G(s-c)\\).\n\n5. **Applying the Property**: Applying the frequency shifting property to our initial Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   L[g(t)e^{ct}](s) = \\frac{1}{((s-c)-a)^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Expression**: The resultant function in the s-domain after introducing \\(h(t) = e^{ct}\\) is:\n   \\[\n   L[g(t)h(t)](s) = \\frac{1}{(s-c-a)^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Dependency Check**: The final expression shows that the resultant function in the s-domain depends on both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), but it also depends on \\(c\\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the resultant function in the s-domain is not independent of the parameter \\(c\\). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
