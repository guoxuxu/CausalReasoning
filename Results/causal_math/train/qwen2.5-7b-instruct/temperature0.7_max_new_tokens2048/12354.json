    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial System Dynamics**: The initial system is described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = i\\omega z\\). This equation tells us that the rate of change of \\(z\\) with respect to time \\(t\\) is proportional to \\(z\\) itself, with the proportionality constant being \\(i\\omega\\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\(f(z)\\)**: The transformation \\(f(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z\\) is applied to the system. Here, \\(\\alpha\\) is a complex constant. Applying this transformation means that the solution to the differential equation is modified by multiplying the solution by \\(e^{\\alpha t}\\). The transformed system can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{\\alpha t}z) = i\\omega e^{\\alpha t}z\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d(e^{\\alpha t}z)}{dt} = e^{\\alpha t}(i\\omega z + \\alpha z)\n   \\]\n   Which simplifies further to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d(e^{\\alpha t}z)}{dt} = e^{\\alpha t}((i\\omega + \\alpha)z)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the transformed system behaves as if it were governed by the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{w} = (i\\omega + \\alpha)w\n   \\]\n   where \\(w = e^{\\alpha t}z\\).\n\n3. **Transformation \\(g(z)\\)**: At a specific time \\(t_1\\), the transformation \\(g(z) = e^{\\beta t}z\\) is applied. This introduces another complex constant \\(\\beta\\). However, since the application of \\(g(z)\\) happens at a specific time \\(t_1\\), we need to consider the effect of this transformation on the system after \\(t_1\\).\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**: To determine the final state \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\), we need to consider the combined effect of both transformations. After applying \\(f(z)\\), the system evolves according to \\(\\dot{w} = (i\\omega + \\alpha)w\\). Then, at \\(t = t_1\\), the transformation \\(g(z)\\) is applied, which means:\n   \\[\n   w(t_1) = e^{\\beta (t_1 - t_1)}z(t_1) = z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   So, the state at \\(t_1\\) remains unchanged by \\(g(z)\\).
