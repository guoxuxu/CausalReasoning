    "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: We have a system described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Lx\\). This means that the rate of change of \\(x\\) at any time \\(t\\) is proportional to \\(x\\) itself, with \\(L\\) being the linear operator.\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The transformation \\(T(x)\\) involves integrating the solution of the differential equation from time 0 to \\(t\\), weighted by \\(e^{Mt}\\).
