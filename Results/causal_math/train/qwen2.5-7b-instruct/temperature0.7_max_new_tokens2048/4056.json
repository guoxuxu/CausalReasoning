Since the PDE is linear, the solution can be expressed as a superposition of solutions corresponding to different initial conditions. Specifically, if the intervention changes the initial condition from \\( u(x, 0) \\) to \\( u_{\\text{post}}(x, 0) \\), the final state \\( u(T, x) \\) will be influenced by both the original and post-intervention conditions.\n\n5. **Causal Reasoning**: The influence of each condition depends on the nature of the solution to the PDE.
