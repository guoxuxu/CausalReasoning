For example, if \\( f(z) \\) is applied at one point and \\( g(z) \\) at another, observing \\( z(T) \\) alone doesn't provide enough information to pinpoint exactly when and how each transformation was applied.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the complexity and the potential for multiple transformations leading to the same final state, it is not possible to definitively determine the specifics of what interventions occurred (whether \\( f(z) \\), \\( g(z) \\), or both) just by observing \\( z(T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
