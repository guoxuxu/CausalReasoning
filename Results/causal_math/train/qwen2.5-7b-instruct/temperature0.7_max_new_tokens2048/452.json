When computing the contour integral of \\( F \\), the value of the integral can be influenced by the presence of poles within the contour.\n\n2. **Contour Deformation and Cauchy's Theorem**: According to Cauchy's theorem, if \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on a closed contour \\( C \\), then the integral of \\( F \\) over \\( C \\) is zero. However, if there are poles inside \\( C \\), the integral will not be zero, and its value will depend on the residues at those poles.\n\n3. **Change in Integral Value**: If the value of the integral changes after an unknown intervention in the contour path, it could be due to several reasons:\n   - New poles being enclosed by the contour.\n   - The contour passing through singularities or branch points.\n   - A change in the function \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\) itself.\n\n4. **Determining the Cause**: To conclusively determine whether the change in the integral value is due to new poles being enclosed by the contour, we would need additional information:\n   - The original and modified contours.\n   - The function \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\).\n   - The positions of any poles of \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\) before and after the modification.\n\nWithout specific details about the function and the nature of the contour deformation, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the change is solely due to new poles being enclosed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

If there are singularities (poles) inside \\( C \\), the integral can be non-zero, and it depends on the residues at those poles.\n\n3. **Change in Integral Value**: If the value of the integral changes after an intervention in the contour path, it suggests that the integral is no longer zero.

    "To determine whether the change in the integral result is due to new poles being enclosed by the contour, let's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Contour Integrals**: The value of a contour integral for a function \\(F(z_1, z_2)\\) depends on the residues of the function at the poles enclosed by the contour. According to the residue theorem, if there are no singularities (poles) inside the contour, the integral will be zero.\n\n2. **Impact of Contour Deformation**: Changing the contour path can affect which poles are enclosed. If the contour deformation brings new poles into the region enclosed by the contour, the value of the integral can change. However, it can also change due to other reasons such as changes in the function itself or the path not being closed anymore.\n\n3. **Residue Theorem**: The residue theorem states that the integral around a closed contour is equal to \\(2\\pi i\\) times the sum of the residues of the function at all poles enclosed by the contour. Therefore, any change in the number or location of poles within the contour will directly affect the value of the integral.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the integral has changed after the contour deformation, it is possible that new poles were enclosed by the contour. However, it is not conclusive without additional information. The change could also be due to other factors such as the function \\(F(z_1, z_2)\\) changing along the contour, or the contour becoming non-closed. \n\nSince we cannot definitively conclude based solely on the information provided that the change is exclusively due to new poles being enclosed, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
