If the Fourier transform is applied to \\(u_0(z)\\), it modifies the initial condition in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Evolution of the Function**: The evolution of \\(u(z)\\) over space (assuming time dependence) would be governed by some form of PDE, but the specific form isn't provided.

    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding Laplace's Equation**: Laplace's equation \\\\( \\Delta u = 0 \\\\) is a second-order partial differential equation (PDE) that describes harmonic functions. In two dimensions, it states that the sum of the second partial derivatives of the function \\( u \\) with respect to the spatial coordinates equals zero.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: The Fourier transform \\\\( \\mathcal{F} \\) converts a function from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. If the Fourier transform of the initial condition \\\\( u_0(z) \\\\) is taken, it provides information about the frequency components present in the initial function.\n\n3. **Evolution Over Space**: The evolution of the function \\\\( u(z) \\\\) without any additional transformations means that the function satisfies Laplace's equation over time or space.

This transformation is linear and does not change the harmonicity of the function (harmonic functions remain harmonic under Fourier transforms).\n\n3. **Evolution of the Function**: The evolution of \\(u(z)\\) over space without additional transformations would still be governed by the same Laplace equation.
