The Fourier transform of this modulated function is:\n   \\[\n   F(z(x)e^{i\\beta x})(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega x} z(x) e^{i\\beta x} \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i(\\omega - \\beta)x} z(x) \\, dx = F(z)(\\omega - \\beta)\n   \\]\n   This shows that modulation by \\( e^{i\\beta x} \\) results in a shift in the frequency domain by \\( \\beta \\).\n\n3. **Understanding Frequency Scaling**: Frequency scaling involves changing the argument of the frequency variable in the Fourier transform. If \\( z(x) \\) is scaled in the time domain by a factor \\( a \\), i.e., \\( z(ax) \\), then the Fourier transform of \\( z(ax) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(z(ax))(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{|a|} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega x/a} z(x) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{|a|} F(z)\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{a}\\right)\n   \\]\n   This indicates that time scaling by \\( a \\) results in a frequency scaling by \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\).\n\n4. **Uniquely Determining Modulation and Frequency Scaling**: To uniquely determine whether a modulation or a frequency scaling (or both) was applied to \\( z(x) \\) from \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\), we need to be able to distinguish between these effects based solely on the form of \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\). However, the Fourier transform does not inherently provide information about whether a shift (modulation) or a scaling (frequency scaling) occurred independently; they are intertwined in the form of the transform.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While we can detect frequency scaling through the scaling factor in the argument of \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\), and we can detect a shift due to modulation, the inverse process to uniquely determine the exact operations performed on \\( z(x) \\) cannot be done without additional information about the original function or the specific operations applied. Thus, we cannot definitively say whether a modulation or a frequency scaling was applied just by looking at \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
