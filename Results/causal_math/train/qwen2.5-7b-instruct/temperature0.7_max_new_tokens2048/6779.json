    "To determine if the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\) at \\( T > F \\) displays a shift depending only on \\( \\eta \\) and not on \\( \\omega \\), let's analyze the given information step-by-step:\n\n1. **System Description**: The system is described by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\), where \\( D \\) is a constant matrix. This is a linear system with solutions that can be expressed using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\( D \\).\n\n2. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).

For a linear system with an input of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), the output will also be a sinusoidal function, but possibly with different amplitude and phase due to the system dynamics.\n\n4. **Intervention of \\( h(x) \\)**: At time \\( F \\), a new function \\( h(x) = e^{j\\eta t}x \\) is introduced. Here, \\( j \\) is the imaginary unit and \\( \\eta \\) is a constant. This function scales the system's state \\( x \\) by \\( e^{j\\eta t} \\).\n\n5. **Effect on Fourier Transform**: Introducing \\( h(x) \\) at time \\( F \\) modifies the system's state from \\( x(t) \\) to \\( e^{j\\eta t}x(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq F \\). In the frequency domain, multiplying by \\( e^{j\\eta t} \\) corresponds to a shift in the frequency spectrum by \\( \\eta \\). This is a well-known property of the Fourier transform, specifically the time-shifting property.\n\n6. **Shift Dependence**: The shift in the Fourier transform depends solely on \\( \\eta \\) because the effect of \\( e^{j\\eta t} \\) is to shift the entire frequency spectrum by \\( \\eta \\). The original frequency content (related to \\( \\omega \\)) remains unchanged; only the phase and magnitude of the existing frequencies are altered.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(T)\\} \\) at \\( T > F \\) will indeed display a shift depending only on \\( \\eta \\) and not on \\( \\omega \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
