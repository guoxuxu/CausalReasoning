    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original System Description**:\n   - We have \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\).\n   - The differential equations for \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are given as \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant matrices.\n   - This implies that \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients.\n\n2. **Laplace Transformation**:\n   - Applying the Laplace transform to \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) separately, we get \\( X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\) and \\( Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\} \\).\n   - From the differential equations, we know that \\( sX(s) = AX(s) \\) and \\( sY(s) = BY(s) \\).
