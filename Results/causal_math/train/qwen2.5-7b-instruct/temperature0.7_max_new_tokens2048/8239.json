    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **System Equation**: The system is governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + Nu \\), where \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) are constant matrices, and \\(u\\) is the control input.\n\n2. **Control Input Introduction**: At time \\(t_1\\), a control input \\(u = v\\) is introduced, where \\(v\\) is a constant vector. This means that from \\(t_1\\) onwards, the system equation becomes \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + Nv \\).\n\n3. **Transformation \\(h(x)\\)**: The transformation \\(h(x) = k^T x\\) is mentioned, but it does not directly affect the system dynamics described by \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + Nv \\). The transformation is a mapping from the state space to a scalar value, which doesn't change how the system evolves over time.\n\n4. **State Evolution**: The state \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) will be determined by the solution to the differential equation starting from \\(t_1\\). Since the system dynamics are linear and the control input is constant after \\(t_1\\), the state \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x(t) = e^{M(t-t_1)}x(t_1) + \\int_{t_1}^{t} e^{M(t-\\tau)}Nv d\\tau\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(e^{M(t-t_1)}\\) is the state transition matrix, which depends solely on \\(M\\) and the time interval.\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**: From the above expression, we see that the state \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) depends on \\(M\\), \\(x(t_1)\\), \\(N\\), and \\(v\\). Importantly, the state \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) does not explicitly depend on the transformation \\(h(x) = k^T x\\), because \\(h(x)\\) is a scalar function of \\(x\\) and does not influence the dynamics of \\(x\\) itself.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: While the transformation \\(h(x)\\) might be useful for certain analyses or interpretations, it does not affect the state evolution described by the differential equation.
