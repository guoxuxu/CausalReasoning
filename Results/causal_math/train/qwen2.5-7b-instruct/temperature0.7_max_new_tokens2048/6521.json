  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{z} \\\\) changes the integrand significantly due to the properties of the exponential function in the complex plane, especially as \\\\( e^{ e^z } \\\\) grows much faster than \\\\( e^{z} \\\\), leading to a fundamentally different result.",
