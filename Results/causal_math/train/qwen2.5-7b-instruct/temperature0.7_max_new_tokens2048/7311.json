The Fourier transform itself does not directly affect the boundary or surface integrals in the context of Stokes' theorem.\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**: The key point here is that the boundary and surface integrals in Stokes' theorem are fundamentally based on the vector field \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) and its curl \\(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F}\\). These integrals do not inherently depend on the specific form of the transform used (Laplace or Fourier) but rather on the underlying field and its derivatives. Therefore, even though the Laplace and Fourier transforms are applied, they do not alter the dependency of the integrals on the original vector field.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The new boundary and surface integrals resulting from applying the Laplace and Fourier transforms will still depend on the original vector field \\(\\mathbf{F}\\) and not just on the transforms themselves.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct output is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
