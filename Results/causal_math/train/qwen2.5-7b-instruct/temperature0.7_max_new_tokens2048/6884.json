Based on the analysis above, if the intervention involves a shift by \\(t_1\\), then:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\frac{e^{-t_1 s}}{s - i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\delta\\)**: From the form of \\(F(s)\\), we can see that:\n   - The term \\(\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\\) indicates that \\(\\omega\\) is the coefficient of \\(i\\) in the denominator.\n   - The term \\(e^{-t_1 s}\\) suggests that \\(t_1\\) is the shift parameter. However, there is no direct mention of \\(\\delta\\) in the given function.\n\nSince the function \\(F(s)\\) only contains information about \\(\\omega\\) and the shift \\(t_1\\), and no additional parameter \\(\\delta\\) is explicitly present in the transformed function, we cannot determine \\(\\delta\\) based solely on \\(F(s)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can precisely determine the values of \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\delta\\) from \\(F(s)\\), let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a real constant.\n\n2. **Transformation**: The Laplace transform of \\(z(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}\\}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s - i\\omega)t} dt.\n   \\]\n   This integral converges for \\(\\text{Re}(s) > \\text{Re}(i\\omega) = 0\\). Evaluating it, we get:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention**: The notation \\(z(t; t_1, \\delta)\\) suggests an intervention at time \\(t_1\\) with some parameter \\(\\delta\\). However, the original function \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) does not involve any such intervention. If there was an intervention, it would likely change the form of the function. For instance, if there was a shift or modification, it could be represented as a modified exponential function or a piecewise function. But since no specific form of intervention is provided, we assume the simplest case where the function remains \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\) but evaluated after an intervention at \\(t_1\\).\n\n4. **Transformed Function**: Given \\(F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t; t_1, \\delta)\\}(s)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\), if the function is still \\(e^{i\\omega (t - t_1)}\\) (a simple delay), then the Laplace transform would be:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\frac{e^{-t_1 s}}{s - i\\omega}.\n   \\]\n   However, without additional information about how \\(\\delta\\) affects the function, we cannot directly infer \\(\\delta\\) from \\(F(s)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the Laplace transform of \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\) (or a simple delay of it) does not provide direct information about \\(\\delta\\), and the problem statement does not specify how \\(\\delta\\) modifies the function, we cannot precisely determine both \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\delta\\) from \\(F(s)\\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
