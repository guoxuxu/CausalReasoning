    "To determine if we can precisely identify which operations (differentiation \\(D_{\\alpha}(f)(t)\\) or integration \\(I_{\\beta}(f)(t)\\)) were applied to \\(f(t)\\) based solely on the final Laplace transform \\(F(s)\\), let's analyze the transformations step by step.\n\n1. **Differentiation in the Time Domain and its Effect on the Laplace Transform**:\n   - If \\(f(t)\\) is transformed to \\(F(s)\\), then the Laplace transform of \\(D_{\\alpha}(f)(t)\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{D_{\\alpha}(f)(t)\\} = s^{\\alpha}F(s) - \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor \\alpha \\rfloor} s^{\\alpha-k-1}f^{(k)}(0)\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(f^{(k)}(0)\\) represents the \\(k\\)th derivative of \\(f(t)\\) evaluated at \\(t=0\\).\n\n2. **Integration in the Time Domain and its Effect on the Laplace Transform**:\n   - The Laplace transform of the \\(I_{\\beta}(f)(t)\\) operation (where \\(I_{\\beta}\\) is the fractional integral of order \\(\\beta\\)) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{I_{\\beta}(f)(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s^{\\beta}}F(s)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combining Both Operations**:\n   - If both differentiation and integration are applied, the combined effect would involve applying one operation after the other. For example, applying \\(D_{\\alpha}(f)(t)\\) followed by \\(I_{\\beta}(f)(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{I_{\\beta}(D_{\\alpha}(f)(t))\\} = \\frac{1}{s^{\\beta}} \\left[s^{\\alpha}F(s) - \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor \\alpha \\rfloor} s^{\\alpha-k-1}f^{(k)}(0)\\right]\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, applying \\(I_{\\beta}(f)(t)\\) followed by \\(D_{\\alpha}(f)(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{D_{\\alpha}(I_{\\beta}(f)(t))\\} = s^{\\alpha} \\left[\\frac{1}{s^{\\beta}}F(s)\\right] - \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor \\alpha \\rfloor} s^{\\alpha-k-1}f^{(k)}(0)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determining the Operations from \\(F(s)\\)**:\n   - To uniquely determine whether the operations were \\(D_{\\alpha}(f)(t)\\), \\(I_{\\beta}(f)(t)\\), or both, we need to look at the form of the resulting \\(F(s)\\).\n   - If the result involves a simple multiplication by \\(s^{\\alpha}\\) or division by \\(s^{\\beta}\\), it suggests either pure differentiation or integration.\n   - However, if the result involves both forms, it indicates a combination of both operations.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given only \\(F(s)\\), it is not always possible to distinguish between the exact sequence of operations (whether they were applied in series or in parallel) without additional information about initial conditions or specific forms of \\(f(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
