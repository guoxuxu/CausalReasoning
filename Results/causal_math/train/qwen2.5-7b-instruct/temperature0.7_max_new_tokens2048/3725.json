  "Problem": "Consider an electrical circuit with a functional relationship between input voltage \\\\( V(s) \\\\) and output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) given by the transfer function \\\\( H(s) \\\\). The equation governing the system is \\\\( I(s) = H(s)V(s) \\\\), where \\\\( s \\\\) is the Laplace transform variable.\n\nIf the voltage function \\\\( V(s) \\\\) is altered by a scaling factor \\\\( k \\\\) at t = 0, and then the system is allowed to evolve under \\\\( I(s) = H(s)V(s) \\\\) without further intervention, will the output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) at s = S be proportionally scaled by \\\\( k \\\\)?",
  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The linear nature of the Laplace transform ensures that scaling the input voltage by \\\\( k \\\\) directly scales the output current \\\\( I(s) \\\\) by the same factor. The system's response being directly proportional to the input is a fundamental property of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The output current I(s) is directly proportional to the input voltage V(s) and the transfer function H(s). Altering V(s) by a scaling factor k results in I(s) being scaled by k at s = S.",
