    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The given partial differential equation (PDE) is \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\). This is a first-order quasilinear PDE known as the inviscid Burgers' equation.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to both sides of the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right) + \\mathcal{F}\\left(u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) = 0\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Fourier transform, this becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}(u)}{\\partial t} + i k \\mathcal{F}(u) \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}(u)}{\\partial k} = 0\n   \\]\n   Let \\( \\mathcal{F}(u)(k, t) = v(k, t) \\). Then the transformed PDE is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + i k v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k} = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Effect of Damping Term**: The damping term is introduced at a later time \\( t_1 \\). This means that for \\( t < t_1 \\), the system evolves according to the original PDE, but for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), there is an additional term affecting the equation. Specifically, if the damping term is \\( -\\alpha u \\) where \\( \\alpha > 0 \\), then the modified PDE is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - \\alpha u = 0\n   \\]\n   Applying the Fourier transform to this modified PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + i k v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k} - \\alpha v = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparison of Solutions**: The key point here is that the introduction of the damping term changes the dynamics of the system starting from \\( t = t_1 \\). Therefore, the Fourier transform of the solution at \\( t = T \\) will not simply correspond to the evolution described by the initial PDE without the damping term, because the solution after \\( t_1 \\) is different due to the additional term.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
