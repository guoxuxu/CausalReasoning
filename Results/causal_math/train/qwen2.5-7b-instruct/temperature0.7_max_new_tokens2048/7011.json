The solution for \\( V(t) \\) when \\( I(t) = I_0 u(t) \\) can be found using the integrating factor method or by recognizing it as a standard form.\n   - The general solution for such an equation is:\n     \\[\n     V(t) = V_{ss}(1 - e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}) + V(0)e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}\n     \\]\n     where \\( V_{ss} \\) is the steady-state voltage and \\( V(0) \\) is the initial voltage.\n\n4. **Steady-State Voltage:**\n   - As \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the term \\( e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}} \\to 0 \\), so the steady-state voltage \\( V_{ss} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     V_{ss} = \\frac{I_0}{R}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Intervention at \\( t = t_1 \\):**\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), the resistance changes to \\( R' \\).\n   - The new differential equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{R'C}V + \\frac{1}{C}I_0\n     \\]\n   - Solving this new differential equation similarly, the new steady-state voltage \\( V_{ss}' \\) is:\n     \\[\n     V_{ss}' = \\frac{I_0}{R'}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Dependence on Initial and Altered Resistance Values:**\n   - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the system reaches a new steady state with the altered resistance \\( R' \\).\n   - The steady-state voltage \\( V(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on the new resistance value \\( R' \\), not the initial resistance \\( R \\).\n\nTherefore, the steady-state voltage \\( V(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the altered resistance \\( R' \\) and not on the initial resistance \\( R \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To determine if the steady-state voltage \\( V(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on both the initial resistance value \\( R \\) and the altered resistance value \\( R' \\), let's analyze the given system step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial Condition with Current Change\nThe differential equation governing the voltage across the capacitor is:\n\\[ \\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\frac{1}{C}I \\]\nGiven the current input as a Heaviside step function:\n\\[ I(t) = I_0 u(t) \\]\nwhere \\( u(t) \\) is the Heaviside function and \\( I_0 \\) is a constant.\n\nAt \\( t = 0 \\), the current changes from 0 to \\( I_0 \\). The solution to the differential equation with this step function can be found using Laplace transforms or by solving it directly. For simplicity, we consider the behavior after the step function is applied.\n\n### Step 2: Steady-State Voltage After Current Change\nAfter the step function is applied at \\( t = 0 \\), the system reaches a new steady state where the derivative of \\( V \\) becomes zero:\n\\[ 0 = -\\frac{1}{R' C} V_{ss} + \\frac{1}{C} I_0 \\]\nSolving for \\( V_{ss} \\):\n\\[ V_{ss} = I_0 R' \\]\n\n### Step 3: Intervention Changing Resistance\nAt a later time \\( t_1 \\), the resistance is changed to \\( R' \\). This change affects the dynamics of the system but does not affect the steady-state voltage once the system has reached it. The steady-state voltage after the resistance change will still be:\n\\[ V_{ss} = I_0 R' \\]\n\n### Step 4: Dependence on Initial and Altered Resistance Values\n- **Initial Resistance \\( R \\)**: The initial resistance \\( R \\) only affects the transient response (the behavior of \\( V(t) \\) before reaching the new steady state).\n- **Altered Resistance \\( R' \\)**: The altered resistance \\( R' \\) determines the new steady-state voltage.\n\nSince the steady-state voltage \\( V(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is solely determined by the altered resistance \\( R' \\) and the current \\( I_0 \\), it does not depend on the initial resistance \\( R \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe steady-state voltage \\( V(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the altered resistance \\( R' \\) and the current \\( I_0 \\), not on the initial resistance \\( R \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
