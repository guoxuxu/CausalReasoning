    "To determine if the adjustment solely influenced by \\( u(t) \\) will have a predictable impact on \\( Z(T) \\) independent of matrix \\( A \\), let's analyze the given system step by step.\n\n1. **Original System**: The original system is described by:\n   \\[\n   Z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{A(s-t)} X(s) \\, ds\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( Z(t) \\) is the output at time \\( t \\), \\( X(t) \\) is the input, and \\( A \\) is a constant complex matrix.\n\n2. **External Control Application**: When an external control \\( u(t) \\) is applied, it modifies \\( X(t) \\) to \\( X_u(t) = X(t) + u(t) \\).
