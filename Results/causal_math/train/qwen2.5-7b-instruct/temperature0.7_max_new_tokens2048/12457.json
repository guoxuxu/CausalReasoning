Other functions could have the same Laplace Transform but different forms of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace Transform of a function \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-st} dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), we need to find its Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) \\).\n\n2. **Calculating the Laplace Transform**: Substituting \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) into the Laplace Transform formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i\\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges if \\( \\text{Re}(s) > \\text{Re}(i\\omega) \\), i.e., \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 0 \\). Evaluating the integral:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-(s-i\\omega)t}}{-(s-i\\omega)} \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Inverting the Laplace Transform**: To determine if \\( z(t) \\) can be uniquely determined from \\( Z(s) \\), we need to consider the inverse Laplace Transform:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Z(s)\\}\n   \\]\n   Given \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\), the inverse Laplace Transform is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Uniqueness of the Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace Transform is generally unique for functions that are analytic in the right half-plane (or have no poles on the imaginary axis). Since \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\) has a simple pole at \\( s = i\\omega \\), which lies on the imaginary axis, the uniqueness theorem does not strictly apply here. However, for practical purposes and typical problems, the inverse Laplace Transform is considered unique.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\), we can uniquely determine \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) without explicitly knowing the original function, provided we are working within the context of the Laplace Transform's domain of convergence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To address this question, let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function and Transformation**:\n   - The given function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n   - The Laplace Transform (LT) of \\( z(t) \\) is defined as \\( Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-st} dt \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**:\n   - For \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), we need to find its Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i\\omega)t} dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral converges for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > \\text{Re}(i\\omega) \\), which simplifies to \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 0 \\). Evaluating the integral:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-(s-i\\omega)t}}{-(s-i\\omega)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{s-i\\omega}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - The inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) is the process of recovering \\( z(t) \\) from \\( Z(s) \\). The ILT is generally unique under certain conditions.\n   - The ILT of \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i\\omega} \\) is indeed \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Determination**:\n   - The uniqueness theorem for the Laplace Transform states that if two functions have the same Laplace Transform, they must be identical on their common interval of definition.\n   - Since the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) \\) of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is uniquely determined and the inverse Laplace Transform of \\( Z(s) \\) recovers \\( z(t) \\), we can conclude that \\( Z(s) \\) can be used to uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) without additional information about the original function.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
