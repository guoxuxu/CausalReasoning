    "To determine whether adding an impulse function \\(\\delta(t - t_0)\\) at time \\(t_0\\) affects the Fourier Transform \\(F(z)\\) of the function \\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\), we need to analyze the effect of the impulse function on the function \\(z(t)\\) and then see how this change propagates through the Fourier Transform.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Impulse Function Addition**:\n   - The impulse function \\(\\delta(t - t_0)\\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\(t_0\\). It has the property that it is zero everywhere except at \\(t = t_0\\), and its integral over all time is 1.\n   - When this impulse function is added to \\(z(t)\\), the new function becomes \\(z'(t) = z(t) + \\delta(t - t_0)\\).\n\n2. **Effect on \\(z(t)\\)**:\n   - At \\(t = t_0\\), the value of \\(z(t)\\) is incremented by 1 (since the integral of \\(\\delta(t - t_0)\\) over any interval containing \\(t_0\\) is 1).\n   - For all other times \\(t \\neq t_0\\), the function remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of \\(z'(t)\\)**:\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\(z'(t)\\) can be derived using the linearity property and the known Fourier Transform of the Dirac delta function.\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\(\\delta(t - t_0)\\) is \\(e^{-i\\omega t_0}\\).\n   - Therefore, the Fourier Transform of \\(z'(t)\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     F(z') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z'(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [z(t) + \\delta(t - t_0)] e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n     \\]\n   - This can be split into two integrals:\n     \\[\n     F(z') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t - t_0) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n     \\]\n   - The first integral is simply the Fourier Transform of \\(z(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = F(z)\n     \\]\n   - The second integral is the Fourier Transform of the impulse function:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t - t_0) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = e^{-i\\omega t_0}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the Fourier Transform of \\(z'(t)\\) is:\n     \\[\n     F(z') = F(z) + e^{-i\\omega t_0}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Adding the impulse function \\(\\delta(t - t_0)\\) at time \\(t_0\\) results in an additional term \\(e^{-i\\omega t_0}\\) in the Fourier Transform \\(F(z)\\).\n   - This means that the Fourier Transform is indeed affected by the addition of the impulse function.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "To determine if adding an impulse function \\( \\delta(t - t_0) \\) at time \\( t_0 \\) affects the Fourier Transform \\( F(z) \\), let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Impulse Function**: The impulse function \\( \\delta(t - t_0) \\) is a mathematical construct that is zero everywhere except at \\( t = t_0 \\), where it is infinite, and its integral over all time is 1. It has the property that when convolved with any function \\( f(t) \\), it results in shifting the function to the location of the impulse, i.e., \\( \\delta(t - t_0) * f(t) = f(t - t_0) \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Impulse on \\( z(t) \\)**: When we add \\( \\delta(t - t_0) \\) to \\( z(t) \\), the new function becomes \\( z'(t) = z(t) + \\delta(t - t_0) \\). At \\( t = t_0 \\), the value of \\( z'(t) \\) will have a sudden jump due to the presence of the impulse.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of Impulse**: The Fourier Transform of the impulse function \\( \\delta(t - t_0) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{\\delta(t - t_0)\\} = e^{-i\\omega t_0}\n   \\]\n   This result comes from the sifting property of the impulse in the Fourier domain, which states that the integral of a function multiplied by an impulse is the value of the function at the location of the impulse.\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of \\( z'(t) \\)**: The Fourier Transform of \\( z'(t) \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   F(z')(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [z(t) + \\delta(t - t_0)] e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n   Using linearity of the Fourier Transform, this can be split into two integrals:\n   \\[\n   F(z')(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(t - t_0) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n   The first integral is simply the Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\), \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\).
