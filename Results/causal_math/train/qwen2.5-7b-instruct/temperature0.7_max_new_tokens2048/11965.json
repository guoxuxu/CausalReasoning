    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The given transformation \\( T[𝐱](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}Μ𝐱(t) dt \\) is a form of the Laplace transform applied to the vector function \\( Χ(t) \\), which is then transformed by the matrix \\( Μ \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Properties**: The Laplace transform has a property that relates the transform of a function to its initial conditions. Specifically, for a function \\( f(t) \\), the Laplace transform of \\( f'(t) \\) (the derivative of \\( f(t) \\)) is \\( sF(s) - f(0) \\), where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\n3. **Applying to Vector Functions**: If \\( Χ(t) \\) is a vector function, then each component of \\( Χ(t) \\) will have its own Laplace transform.
