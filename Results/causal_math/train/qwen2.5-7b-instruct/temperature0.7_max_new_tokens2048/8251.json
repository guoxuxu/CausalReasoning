    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with the function \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\).\n\n2. **Transformation by Integral Operator \\(T\\)**:\n   - The integral operator \\(T\\) is defined as \\(Tf(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s} f(s) ds\\).\n   - Applying \\(T\\) to \\(z(t)\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     Tz(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s} e^{i\\omega s} ds = \\int_0^t e^{i(\\alpha + \\omega)s} ds.\n     \\]\n   - This integral can be evaluated as:\n     \\[\n     Tz(t) = \\frac{e^{i(\\alpha + \\omega)t} - 1}{i(\\alpha + \\omega)}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Linear Transformation \\(L\\)**:\n   - The linear transformation \\(L\\) is defined as \\(Lz(t) = e^{-i\\beta t}z(t)\\).\n   - At time \\(t_1\\), applying \\(L\\) to \\(z(t)\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     Lz(t_1) = e^{-i\\beta t_1} z(t_1) = e^{-i\\beta t_1} e^{i\\omega t_1} = e^{i(\\omega - \\beta)t_1}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Resultant State Analysis**:\n   - The problem asks if the resultant state at time \\(t > t_1\\) only depends on the immediate past state without considering historical transformations.\n   - From the definition of \\(L\\), the state at \\(t_1\\) is transformed to \\(e^{i(\\omega - \\beta)t_1}\\).\n   - However, the integral operator \\(T\\) involves an integral from \\(0\\) to \\(t\\), which means it considers the entire history of the function from \\(0\\) to \\(t\\). Therefore, the state at \\(t > t_1\\) would still depend on the values of \\(z(s)\\) for all \\(s \\in [0, t]\\), not just the state at \\(t_1\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the integral operator \\(T\\) inherently considers the entire history of the function, the resultant state at \\(t > t_1\\) cannot be solely determined by the immediate past state without considering historical transformations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n2. **Transformation by Integral Operator \\( T \\)**: The integral operator \\( T \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   Tf(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s} f(s) \\, ds\n   \\]\n   Applying \\( T \\) to \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   Tz(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\alpha s} e^{i\\omega s} \\, ds = \\int_0^t e^{i(\\alpha + \\omega)s} \\, ds\n   \\]\n   This can be evaluated as:\n   \\[\n   Tz(t) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{i(\\alpha + \\omega)s}}{i(\\alpha + \\omega)} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{e^{i(\\alpha + \\omega)t} - 1}{i(\\alpha + \\omega)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Linear Transformation \\( L \\)**: The linear transformation \\( L \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   Lz(t) = e^{-i\\beta t} z(t)\n   \\]\n   Applying \\( L \\) at time \\( t_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   Lz(t_1) = e^{-i\\beta t_1} e^{i\\omega t_1} = e^{i(\\omega - \\beta)t_1}\n   \\]\n   Let’s denote the resultant state after applying \\( L \\) at \\( t_1 \\) as \\( z(t_2) \\).
