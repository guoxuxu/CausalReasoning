    "To determine whether we can exactly find the original functions \\( g(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) from \\( F(s) = G(s)H(s) \\), let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Convolution Theorem**: The convolution theorem for Laplace transforms states that if \\( f(t) = (g * h)(t) \\), then \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = G(s)H(s) \\). Here, \\( * \\) denotes convolution.\n\n2. **Given Information**: We have \\( F(s) = G(s)H(s) \\).

The product of these transforms in the Laplace domain is given as \\(F(s) = G(s)H(s)\\).\n\n2. **Convolution in the Time Domain**: In the time domain, the inverse Laplace transform of \\(F(s)\\) would be the convolution of \\(g(t)\\) and \\(h(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   f(t) = (g * h)(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} g(\\tau)h(t-\\tau)d\\tau\n   \\]\n   where \\(f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\}\\).\n\n3. **Uniqueness of the Inverse Laplace Transform**: Given that \\(F(s) = G(s)H(s)\\), there could be multiple pairs of \\(g(t)\\) and \\(h(t)\\) that satisfy this condition.
