This factor does not change the form of the spatial part of the solution (i.e., it remains a sine wave with frequency \\(\\beta\\)), but it affects the amplitude.\n\n7. **Dependence on \\(\\alpha\\)**: The heat equation dictates that the temperature distribution will decay over time due to thermal diffusion, and the rate of this decay depends on \\(\\alpha\\). The exponential term \\( e^{-t_1} \\) is already a function of time and does not introduce any additional spatial dependence beyond what is already present in the sine wave.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The temperature distribution at any future time \\( t = T \\) (where \\( T > t_1 \\)) will still be a sine wave with frequency \\(\\beta\\), but its amplitude will be further reduced by the factor \\( e^{-(T - t_1)} \\).

However, the form of the solution also depends on the coefficients \\(B_n\\), which are influenced by the nature of the intervention.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since the coefficients \\(B_n\\) are determined by the nature of the intervention (which changes the form of the initial condition at \\(t_1\\)), the temperature distribution at \\(t = T\\) will not solely depend on \\(\\alpha\\). It will also be influenced by the nature of the intervention.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether the temperature distribution at \\( t = T \\) (where \\( T > t_1 \\)) will solely depend on \\( \\alpha \\) and not be influenced by the nature of the intervention at \\( t = t_1 \\), we need to analyze the system's behavior over time.\n\n1. **Initial Condition and Heat Equation**:\n   - The initial condition is given by \\( u(x, 0) = \\sin(\\beta x) \\).\n   - The heat equation is \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\).\n\n2. **Intervention at \\( t = t_1 \\)**:\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), the temperature distribution changes to \\( u(x, t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\sin(\\beta x) \\).\n   - This is an external intervention that modifies the temperature distribution at a specific time.\n\n3. **Behavior After Intervention**:\n   - After the intervention, the new initial condition for the heat equation from \\( t = t_1 \\) onwards is \\( u(x, t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\sin(\\beta x) \\).\n   - The heat equation will continue to govern the evolution of \\( u(x, t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Solution After Intervention**:\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the solution to the heat equation with the new initial condition \\( u(x, t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\sin(\\beta x) \\) will be influenced by both the initial condition at \\( t_1 \\) and the thermal diffusivity \\( \\alpha \\).\n   - The form of the solution will still involve \\( \\alpha \\) because it determines how quickly the temperature distribution spreads out due to diffusion.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the initial condition at \\( t = 0 \\) has been modified at \\( t = t_1 \\), the subsequent evolution of the temperature distribution from \\( t = t_1 \\) onwards will still depend on \\( \\alpha \\).\n   - Therefore, the temperature distribution at \\( t = T \\) (where \\( T > t_1 \\)) will be influenced by the nature of the intervention at \\( t = t_1 \\) through its impact on the initial condition for the subsequent time period.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
