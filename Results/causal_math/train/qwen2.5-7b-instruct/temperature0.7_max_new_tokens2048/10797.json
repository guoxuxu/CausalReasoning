The form of this differential equation does not change; it continues to govern the evolution of \\( x(t) \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform**: We need to compute the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{ x(t) \\} \\) of the evolved function \\( x(t) \\). The Fourier transform is a linear operation, which means that if we start with a transformed function \\( Dx \\), the Fourier transform of \\( Dx \\) will be \\( D\\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\).\n\n4. **Comparison**: The Fourier transform of the initial condition \\( x(0) \\) after transformation is \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{ Dx(0) \\} \\). Since \\( x(0) \\) is initially transformed to \\( Dx(0) \\), the Fourier transform of the evolved function \\( x(t) \\) starting from \\( Dx(0) \\) will indeed be \\( D \\) times the Fourier transform of the original function starting from \\( x(0) \\).\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of the function \\( x(t) \\) after the transformation \\( f(x) = Dx \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and subsequent evolution will be \\( D \\) times the Fourier transform of the original function. However, the statement asks if \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{ x(t) \\} \\) will be equal to \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{ Dx \\} \\), which implies no such scaling factor.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation**: We start with a function \\( x(t) \\) that undergoes a linear transformation \\( f(x) = Dx \\) at \\( t = 0 \\). This means the initial state of the system is transformed by \\( D \\).\n\n2. **Differential Equation**: The function \\( x(t) \\) evolves over time according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are matrices, and \\( u(t) \\) is an input signal.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform**: We need to find the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} \\) of the evolved function \\( x(t) \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Transformation on Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier transform of a function \\( x(t) \\) is given by \\( X(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-j2\\pi ft} dt \\).\n   - If \\( x(t) \\) is initially transformed by \\( f(x) = Dx \\), the new initial condition becomes \\( Dx(0) \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of the initial condition \\( Dx(0) \\) is \\( D \\cdot X(f) \\), where \\( X(f) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( x(t) \\).\n\n5. **Evolution of the System**: The evolution of \\( x(t) \\) under the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Ax + Bu \\) does not change the fact that the Fourier transform of the initial condition is scaled by \\( D \\). The Fourier transform of the solution to the differential equation can be found using the properties of the Fourier transform for linear systems.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the Fourier transform of the initial condition \\( x(0) \\) is scaled by \\( D \\) and the evolution of the system does not change this scaling factor, the Fourier transform of the evolved function \\( x(t) \\) will indeed be equal to \\( D \\) times the Fourier transform of the original function \\( x(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThe Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{ x(t) \\} \\) will not be equal to \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{ Dx \\} \\) because \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{ Dx \\} = D \\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{ x(t) \\} \\), meaning it is scaled by \\( D \\).",
