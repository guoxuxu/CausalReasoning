Since the filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) modifies the Fourier transform at each step, it directly influences the end state \\(\\tilde{u}(T,k)\\).\n\nTherefore, the end state \\(\\tilde{u}(T,k)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) does depend on the filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) because the filtering step changes the spectral content of the Fourier transform, which in turn affects the final state when transformed back to the spatial domain.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the end state \\(\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) only depends on the original differential operator \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) and not the filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), let's analyze the process step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State**: The initial state of the system is described by the PDE \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\mathcal{L}u\\).\n\n2. **Intervention at \\(t_1\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), an additional Fourier filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) modifies the conditions. This means that after \\(t_1\\), the evolution of \\(u\\) is influenced by both \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{G}\\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to the modified condition yields \\(F_u\\). The Fourier transform converts the spatial and temporal dynamics into frequency domain representation.\n\n4. **Filtering Process**: The filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is applied to \\(F_u\\), resulting in \\(G_{filter}\\). This step modifies the frequency components of the solution according to the characteristics of \\(\\mathcal{G}\\).\n\n5. **Filtered Fourier Transform**: The result of the filtering process, \\(G_{filter}\\), is then transformed back to the spatial-temporal domain to obtain the filtered state, denoted as \\(\\text{filtered\\_F_u}\\).\n\n6. **End State**: The end state \\(\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) is obtained from the filtered state. Since the filtering process is applied after the Fourier transform and the evolution according to \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), the influence of \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) on the end state is not directly traceable to the original \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) alone but is a composite effect of both \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{G}\\).\n\nGiven the above steps, the end state \\(\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) does indeed depend on both the original differential operator \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) and the filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\). Therefore, the end state cannot be said to only depend on \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) without considering \\(\\mathcal{G}\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To determine whether the end state \\(\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) depends only on the original differential operator \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) and not on the filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), we need to analyze the effect of the Fourier transform and the filter on the system.\n\n1. **Original System**: The system is governed by the PDE \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\mathcal{L}u\\). Applying the Fourier transform to this equation yields \\(\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}}{\\partial t} = \\mathcal{L}_k \\tilde{u}\\), where \\(\\mathcal{L}_k\\) is the Fourier transform of \\(\\mathcal{L}\\).\n\n2. **Intervention**: At time \\(t_1\\), an additional Fourier filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) is applied to the transformed solution \\(\\tilde{u}\\). This modifies the transformed solution to \\(\\tilde{u}_{\\text{filtered}}\\).\n\n3. **Effect of Filter**: The filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) will modify the frequency components of \\(\\tilde{u}\\). However, after filtering, the system continues to evolve according to the modified equation \\(\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{u}_{\\text{filtered}}}{\\partial t} = \\mathcal{L}_k \\tilde{u}_{\\text{filtered}}\\).\n\n4. **End State**: The end state \\(\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will be the result of the evolution of \\(\\tilde{u}_{\\text{filtered}}\\) under the influence of \\(\\mathcal{L}_k\\). Since \\(\\mathcal{L}_k\\) is derived from \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) through the Fourier transform, the end state \\(\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\) will still be influenced by \\(\\mathcal{L}\\).\n\n5. **Causality**: The application of the filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) at \\(t_1\\) introduces a modification that affects the intermediate states but does not fundamentally change the nature of the evolution described by \\(\\mathcal{L}_k\\). Therefore, the final state \\(\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) can be seen as a consequence of the original differential operator \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) and the initial conditions modified by \\(\\mathcal{G}\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the end state \\(\\tilde{u}(T, k)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) does depend on the original differential operator \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) and the filter \\(\\mathcal{G}\\). However, the core dependency remains on \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) since the filter's effect is integrated into the subsequent evolution.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
