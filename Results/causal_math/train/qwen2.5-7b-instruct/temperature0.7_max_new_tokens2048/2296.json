    "To determine if we can conclusively identify the exact interventions (values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)) solely based on the outcome \\(z(s)\\), let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The given function \\(g(z)\\) represents the Laplace transform of \\(z(t)\\).

Each pole corresponds to one of the exponentials in the original function. Specifically, for \\(z(s) = \\frac{1}{s-a} + \\frac{1}{s-b}\\), the poles are at \\(s = a\\) and \\(s = b\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the poles directly correspond to the parameters \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the exponentials, we can conclusively identify the exact values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the poles of \\(z(s)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To answer this question, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Function**: The function \\( g(z) \\) represents the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\). The Laplace transform converts a time-domain function \\( z(t) \\) into a frequency-domain function \\( z(s) \\).\n\n2. **Form of \\( z(s) \\)**: If \\( z(t) \\) involves multiple exponential functions, say \\( e^{at} \\) and \\( e^{bt} \\), then the Laplace transform will have terms that reflect these exponentials.
