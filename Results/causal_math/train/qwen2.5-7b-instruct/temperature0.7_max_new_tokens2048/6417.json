    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) that describes an oscillator in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Transformation Matrix**: The transformation matrix \\( M \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   M = \\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\\\ b & a \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n   This matrix represents a linear transformation that combines rotation and scaling.\n\n3. **Applying Transformation**: When this matrix \\( M \\) is applied to the initial state \\( z(0) \\), it transforms \\( z(0) \\) into another point \\( z'(0) \\).
