It involves second-order derivatives with respect to both time \\(t\\) and space (which we can infer from the Laplacian operator \\(\\nabla^2\\)).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to the wave equation in time results in transforming it into a form that depends only on spatial coordinates and frequency.
