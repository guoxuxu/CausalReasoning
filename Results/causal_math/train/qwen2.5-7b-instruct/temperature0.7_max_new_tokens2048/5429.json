    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation for Natural Cooling**:\n   The differential equation governing the natural cooling process is given as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\Delta T\n   \\]\n   This is a first-order linear differential equation.

However, we need to consider the combined effect on the temperature difference over time.\n\n3. **Combining Heating and Cooling**:\n   If the system is initially subjected to the external heating process and then allowed to cool naturally, the total effect on the temperature difference can be considered as the sum of the initial heating and subsequent cooling. \n\n4. **Effect of External Heating**:\n   During the heating phase, the temperature difference increases according to the heating function \\( h(t) \\). However, once the heating stops (i.e., \\( h(t) = 0 \\)), the system will start cooling according to the natural cooling process described by the differential equation.\n\n5. **Final Temperature Difference**:\n   At any time \\( t \\), the temperature difference will be the result of the initial heating followed by cooling.

    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Differential Equation**:\n   The differential equation \\(\\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\Delta T\\) describes exponential decay of temperature difference \\(\\Delta T\\) over time \\(t\\). This means that without any external heating, the temperature difference would decrease exponentially with a rate constant \\(k\\).\n\n2. **External Heating Process**:\n   The external heating process is given by \\(h(t) = e^{At}\\Delta T_0\\). This function suggests that the heating increases exponentially over time, which could counteract the cooling effect of the natural process.\n\n3. **Effect of External Heating**:\n   When the external heating is applied, it adds to the temperature difference \\(\\Delta T\\). However, once the heating stops, the system returns to the original cooling process described by \\(\\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\Delta T\\).\n\n4. **Final State After Heating Stops**:\n   At the moment when the heating stops (let's call this time \\(T_h\\)), the temperature difference will be \\(\\Delta T(T_h) = \\Delta T_0 + \\int_{0}^{T_h} e^{A(t-T_h)}\\Delta T_0 dt\\). Simplifying this integral gives us the final temperature difference after the heating process.\n\n5. **Comparison with Natural Cooling**:\n   If we compare this final state to what would happen if we had simply cooled the body from \\(\\Delta T_0\\) under the natural cooling process, we need to solve the differential equation for both scenarios and compare them at time \\(T\\).\n\n6. **Natural Cooling Only**:\n   The solution to \\(\\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\Delta T\\) starting from \\(\\Delta T_0\\) is \\(\\Delta T(t) = \\Delta T_0 e^{-kt}\\). At time \\(T\\), the temperature difference would be \\(\\Delta T(T) = \\Delta T_0 e^{-kT}\\).\n\n7. **Heating Then Cooling**:\n   For the scenario with heating, we need to consider the effect of the heating up to time \\(T_h\\) and then cooling from \\(\\Delta T(T_h)\\) onwards. The exact expression would be more complex but will generally not simplify to the same form as simple cooling from \\(\\Delta T_0\\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   Due to the complexity introduced by the external heating, the temperature difference at time \\(T\\) after stopping the heating will not generally be the same as if the body had simply been cooled from \\(\\Delta T_0\\) without any external heating.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition with External Heating:**\n   The differential equation governing the temperature change due to external heating is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\Delta T + h(t)\n   \\]\n   Given \\( h(t) = e^{At}\\Delta T_0 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\Delta T + e^{At}\\Delta T_0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solving the Differential Equation:**\n   To solve this non-homogeneous differential equation, we use the method of integrating factors.

After this point, the system evolves according to the natural cooling process. The temperature difference at any time \\( t \\geq T_h \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T(t) = \\Delta T(T_h) e^{-k(t - T_h)}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\Delta T(T_h) \\) is the temperature difference at the moment the heating process stops.\n\n5. **Comparing with Direct Cooling from Initial Condition:**\n   If the body had been cooled directly from \\( \\Delta T_0 \\) under the natural cooling process without any external heating, the temperature difference at time \\( t = T \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T_{\\text{direct}}(T) = \\Delta T_0 e^{-kT}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   To determine if these two scenarios result in the same temperature difference at time \\( t = T \\), we need to compare \\( \\Delta T(T) \\) (after the heating process has stopped) with \\( \\Delta T_{\\text{direct}}(T) \\).\n\n   Since the exact form of \\( \\Delta T(T_h) \\) depends on the specific details of the heating process, it is not generally true that \\( \\Delta T(T) = \\Delta T_{\\text{direct}}(T) \\) unless the heating process is such that \\( \\Delta T(T_h) = \\Delta T_0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the temperature difference at time \\( t = T \\) will not necessarily be the same as if the body had been cooled directly from \\( \\Delta T_0 \\) under the natural cooling process.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition and External Heating Process:**\n   - The external heating process is given by \\( h(t) = e^{At}\\Delta T_0 \\).\n   - This means that the temperature difference \\( \\Delta T(t) \\) due to the heating process can be influenced by \\( h(t) \\).\n\n2. **Differential Equation for Natural Cooling:**\n   - The natural cooling process is governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\Delta T \\).\n   - The solution to this differential equation with initial condition \\( \\Delta T(0) = \\Delta T_0 \\) is \\( \\Delta T(t) = \\Delta T_0 e^{-kt} \\).\n\n3. **Combining Heating and Cooling Processes:**\n   - When the external heating process is applied, the total temperature difference \\( \\Delta T(t) \\) is influenced by both the heating term and the cooling term.\n   - However, once the heating process stops (i.e., \\( h(t) = 0 \\)), the system will only follow the natural cooling process.\n\n4. **Final State Analysis:**\n   - At time \\( t = T \\), if the heating process has stopped (i.e., \\( h(T) = 0 \\)), the system will start to cool naturally from the temperature difference \\( \\Delta T(T) \\) caused by the heating process.\n   - The natural cooling process will then follow \\( \\Delta T(t) = \\Delta T(T) e^{-k(t-T)} \\).\n\n5. **Comparing the Final States:**\n   - If we directly apply the natural cooling process from \\( \\Delta T_0 \\) to \\( \\Delta T(T) \\), the final temperature difference at \\( t = T \\) would be \\( \\Delta T(T) = \\Delta T_0 e^{-kT} \\).\n   - Since the heating process stops at \\( t = T \\), the system will then cool from \\( \\Delta T(T) \\) to \\( \\Delta T(T) e^{-k(T-T)} = \\Delta T(T) \\).\n\nGiven these steps, the temperature difference \\( \\Delta T(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) after the heating process stops will not be exactly the same as if it had just been cooled from \\( \\Delta T_0 \\) under the natural cooling process alone.
