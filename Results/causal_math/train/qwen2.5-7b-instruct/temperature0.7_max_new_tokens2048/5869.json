    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition Transformation**: At \\(t = 0\\), we apply the transformation \\(g(x) = \\sin(Cx)\\) to the initial state \\(x_0\\). This results in a new initial condition \\(x_0' = \\sin(Cx_0)\\).\n\n2. **System Dynamics Without Transformation**: If there were no transformation, the state \\(x(t)\\) would evolve according to the system dynamics \\(\\dot{x} = Dx + Bu\\) starting from \\(x_0\\).\n\n3. **System Dynamics With Transformation**: When the transformation is applied, the new initial condition is \\(x_0'\\). The state \\(x'(t)\\) evolves according to the same system dynamics but starting from \\(x_0'\\).\n\n4. **Transformation Effect on Dynamics**: The transformation \\(g(x) = \\sin(Cx)\\) is nonlinear. Nonlinear transformations can significantly alter the behavior of the system over time.
