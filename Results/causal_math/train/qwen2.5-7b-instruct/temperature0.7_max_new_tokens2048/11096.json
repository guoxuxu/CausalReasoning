    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Impedance**: The initial impedance \\( Z(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d} \\) is a rational function of \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Adding a Parallel Capacitor**: When a parallel capacitor with impedance \\( \\frac{1}{sC} \\) is added, it changes the overall impedance.
