This transformation converts the time-domain function \\( z^*(t) \\) to its frequency-domain representation \\( z(s) \\).

Conversely, if \\( z(t) \\) is given, it may not be straightforward to determine \\( a \\) without additional information because multiple values of \\( a \\) could lead to similar forms of \\( z(t) \\) through the inverse transform.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven only the final output \\( z(t) \\) after all transformations, it is generally not possible to precisely determine the value of \\( a \\) without additional information about the specific forms of the functions involved in the transformations.
