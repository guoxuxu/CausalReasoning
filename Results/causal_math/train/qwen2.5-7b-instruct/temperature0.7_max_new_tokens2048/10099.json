    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: We start with a function \\( h(z) \\) defined over the complex plane.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\( h(z) \\) gives us \\( H(w) \\). The Fourier transform is a linear operation that maps a function from the time (or spatial) domain to the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Modifying \\( H(w) \\)**: We then modify \\( H(w) \\) by multiplying it with a Gaussian function \\( \\exp(-aw^2) \\).

This means that the higher-order derivatives of \\( h(z) \\) will be attenuated more significantly than the lower-order ones.\n\n- **Impact on Polynomial Degree**: If \\( h(z) \\) is a polynomial of degree \\( n \\), its highest derivative will be a constant (degree 0). Higher derivatives will be zero. The Gaussian multiplication will affect these higher derivatives but not the lower ones. However, the core structure of the polynomial, which is determined by its leading term, will remain recognizable in the inverse transform, even if the coefficients and some terms are altered.\n\n- **Conclusion**: While the exact form of \\( g(z) \\) might differ from \\( h(z) \\) due to the filtering effect of the Gaussian, the fundamental property of being a polynomial of the same degree should still hold. The leading term, which defines the polynomial degree, will not be altered by the Gaussian filter.\n\nTherefore, the resulting function \\( g(z) \\) will still resemble the original \\( h(z) \\) in terms of its core property of polynomial degree.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
