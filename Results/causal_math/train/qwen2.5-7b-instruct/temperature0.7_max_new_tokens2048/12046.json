However, after \\( t_1 \\), the influence of \\( z(0) \\) diminishes as it is integrated out in the Laplace domain due to the properties of the Laplace transform.\n\n7. **Influence of \\( \\omega \\)**: The frequency \\( \\omega \\) affects the form of \\( z(t) \\) but does not directly influence the Laplace transform in a way that is independent of the initial conditions.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The resultant transform \\( Z(s) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed be influenced by the initial condition \\( z(0) \\) and the frequency \\( \\omega \\) through the damping factor's effect on the system.
