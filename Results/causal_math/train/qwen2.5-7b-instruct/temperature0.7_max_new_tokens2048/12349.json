These roots are given by:\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}}{2}.\n   \\]\n   From the form of \\( y(t) \\), we can extract information about these roots, which directly give us \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\nSince the solution \\( y(t) \\) provides enough information to determine the characteristic roots of the polynomial \\( s^2 + ps + q \\), and thus the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), we can uniquely determine the original differential equation \\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To address this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have an ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form \\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are constants. The goal is to determine if the solution obtained from the transformed algebraic equation through the Laplace Transform (L) and Inverse Laplace Transform (\\( L^{-1} \\)) can uniquely determine the original ODE.\n\n2. **Transformation Process**:\n   - Apply the Laplace Transform \\( L \\) to the given ODE.\n   - This results in an algebraic equation involving the Laplace transform of \\( y(t) \\), denoted as \\( Y(s) \\).\n   - Solve the resulting algebraic equation for \\( Y(s) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Transformation**:\n   - Apply the Inverse Laplace Transform \\( L^{-1} \\) to \\( Y(s) \\) to obtain the solution \\( y(t) \\) in the time domain.\n\n4. **Uniqueness Consideration**:\n   - The Laplace Transform is a linear operator and is one-to-one for functions that are piecewise continuous and of exponential order.\n   - Given a unique solution \\( y(t) \\) in the time domain, applying the Inverse Laplace Transform should ideally give us back the same algebraic equation from which \\( Y(s) \\) was derived.\n   - However, the uniqueness of the original ODE depends on whether the coefficients \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are uniquely determined from the transformed solution.\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - The transformed equation involves only the coefficients \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) in the transformed space.\n   - If we know the exact form of the transformed solution, we can work backwards to determine \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) uniquely because the characteristic equation derived from the transformed algebraic equation is uniquely linked to the original ODE parameters.\n   - Therefore, knowing the solution \\( y(t) \\) allows us to reconstruct the original ODE up to the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the solution to the transformed algebraic equation, we can indeed uniquely determine the original differential equation \\( y'' + py' + qy = 0 \\) by reconstructing the characteristic equation and solving for \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
