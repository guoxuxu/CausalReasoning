    "To determine whether we can uniquely determine the initial conditions \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\) from the given integral transform \\(F(z)\\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Differential Equations**: We have two differential equations:\n   - \\(\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)\\)\n   - \\(\\dot{y}(t) = By(t)\\)\n\n2. **Solutions to Differential Equations**: The solutions to these differential equations are exponential functions because \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constant matrices.\n   - For \\(\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)\\), the solution is \\(x(t) = x(0)e^{At}\\).\n   - For \\(\\dot{y}(t) = By(t)\\), the solution is \\(y(t) = y(0)e^{Bt}\\).\n\n3. **Integral Transform**: The integral transform is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} [x(0)e^{At} + iy(0)e^{Bt}] dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts**: We can separate the real and imaginary parts of the integral:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} x(0)e^{At} dt + i \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} y(0)e^{Bt} dt\n   \\]\n\n5. **Evaluate Integrals**: These integrals can be evaluated using properties of Laplace transforms.
