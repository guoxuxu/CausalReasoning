    "To address this question, let's reason through the steps involved:\n\n1. **Original PDE and Initial Condition**: The given PDE is \\(\\nabla^2 u = -\\lambda u\\). This is a Helmholtz equation, which describes wave propagation and other phenomena.\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**: When we apply the Laplace transform to the function \\(u(t, x)\\) with respect to \\(t\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}[u(t, x)](s) = U(s, x)\n   \\]\n   The transformed PDE becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\nabla^2 U(s, x) = -\\lambda U(s, x)\n   \\]\n   This is also a Helmholtz equation but in the Laplace domain.\n\n3. **Solving the Transformed Equation**: Solving the transformed equation for \\(U(s, x)\\) gives us the solution in the Laplace domain.\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To find \\(u(t, x)\\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\(U(s, x)\\):\n   \\[\n   u(t, x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}[U(s, x)]\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison with Direct Solution**: The key point here is that the Laplace transform is a linear operator and the Helmholtz equation is linear. Therefore, applying the Laplace transform, solving the transformed equation, and then taking the inverse Laplace transform should yield the same solution as directly solving the original PDE.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that the solution obtained by transforming, solving, and then inverting the transform is indeed the same as solving the original PDE directly.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To determine if the solution obtained from applying the Laplace transform and then inverting it back yields the same result as directly solving the original partial differential equation (PDE), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Original PDE**: The given PDE is \\(\\nabla^2 u = -\\lambda u\\). This is a Helmholtz equation, which describes wave propagation or potential fields in a homogeneous medium.\n\n2. **Apply the Laplace Transform**: Applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the PDE with respect to \\(t\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}[\\nabla^2 u](s) = \\mathcal{L}[-\\lambda u](s)\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Laplace transform that \\(\\mathcal{L}[\\nabla^2 u] = s^2 U(s, x) - s u(0, x) - u'(0, x)\\) (assuming initial conditions at \\(t=0\\)), and knowing that \\(\\mathcal{L}[-\\lambda u] = -\\lambda U(s, x)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   s^2 U(s, x) - s u(0, x) - u'(0, x) = -\\lambda U(s, x)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Transformed Equation**: Rearrange the equation to solve for \\(U(s, x)\\):\n   \\[\n   s^2 U(s, x) + \\lambda U(s, x) = s u(0, x) + u'(0, x)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   U(s, x) (s^2 + \\lambda) = s u(0, x) + u'(0, x)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   U(s, x) = \\frac{s u(0, x) + u'(0, x)}{s^2 + \\lambda}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To find \\(u(t, x)\\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\(U(s, x)\\):\n   \\[\n   u(t, x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\frac{s u(0, x) + u'(0, x)}{s^2 + \\lambda}\\right]\n   \\]\n   Using linearity and properties of the inverse Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   u(t, x) = u(0, x) \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\frac{s}{s^2 + \\lambda}\\right] + u'(0, x) \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\frac{1}{s^2 + \\lambda}\\right]\n   \\]\n   Knowing that \\(\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\frac{s}{s^2 + \\lambda}\\right] = \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda} t)\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\frac{1}{s^2 + \\lambda}\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} t)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   u(t, x) = u(0, x) \\cos(\\sqrt{\\lambda} t) + \\frac{u'(0, x)}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\lambda} t)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compare with Direct Solution**: The direct solution of the Helmholtz equation involves solving the PDE using separation of variables or other methods, which would also yield a form involving trigonometric functions of \\(t\\). The form derived from the Laplace transform matches the expected form of the solution to the Helmholtz equation.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, applying the Laplace transform, solving the transformed equation, and then inverting it back indeed yields the same solution as directly solving the original PDE.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
