Here, the term \\( cz \\) adds a linear dependence on \\( z \\) but does not affect the integral part of \\( g(z) \\) directly related to \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Transformation with \\( d \\)**: The function is further modified to \\( h(z) = g(z) + dz \\) at time \\( t = t_1 \\).

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The original function is \\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z^t \\, dt \\). This function depends on \\( s \\) and \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: Initially, the function is transformed to \\( h(z) = g(z) + cz \\), where \\( c \\) is a constant complex number. Here, \\( c \\) affects the behavior of \\( h(z) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention**: An intervention modifies the function to \\( h(z) = g(z) + dz \\), where \\( d \\) is another constant complex number. This change only affects the constant term added to \\( g(z) \\).\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The original function \\( g(z) \\) depends on \\( s \\) and \\( z \\).\n   - The modified function \\( h(z) = g(z) + dz \\) includes the additional term \\( dz \\), which is dependent on \\( d \\).\n   - However, the core dependency of \\( g(z) \\) on \\( s \\) remains unchanged by the addition of \\( dz \\).\n\n5. **Behavior Under Intervention**:\n   - The behavior of \\( h(z) \\) after the intervention is still primarily driven by \\( s \\) and \\( z \\), with an additional linear term that depends on \\( d \\).\n   - The modification from \\( c \\) to \\( d \\) does not alter the fundamental dependency on \\( s \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the behavior of the integral \\( g(z) \\) still depends on \\( s \\) and not on \\( c \\) or \\( d \\) in the sense that the core structure and dependency on \\( s \\) remain intact. The constants \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) only modify the additive terms but do not affect the dependency on \\( s \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
