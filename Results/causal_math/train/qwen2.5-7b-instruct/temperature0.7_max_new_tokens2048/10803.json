The result \\(u(T)\\) will indeed depend on the characteristics of both \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) because these matrices affect the amplitude and phase of the complex exponential, not just the frequency \\(\\omega\\).",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: We start with the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n2. **Transformation by Matrix \\( M \\)**: The function is transformed to \\( w(t) = M z(t) \\). Here, \\( M \\) affects both the amplitude and frequency of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention by Matrix \\( N \\)**: At a specific time \\( t = t_1 \\), an additional transformation by matrix \\( N \\) yields \\( u(t) = N w(t) \\).\n\n4. **Question Analysis**: We need to determine if the result \\( u(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends solely on the original \\( \\omega \\) and not on the characteristics of \\( M \\) or \\( N \\).\n\nLet's consider the transformations mathematically:\n\n- Initially, \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n- After applying \\( M \\), we have \\( w(t) = M e^{i\\omega t} \\). Since \\( M \\) can be represented as a matrix that modifies the amplitude and possibly the phase, we can write \\( w(t) = A(t) e^{i(\\omega' t + \\phi(t))} \\), where \\( A(t) \\) is the amplitude, \\( \\omega' \\) is the modified frequency, and \\( \\phi(t) \\) is the phase shift.\n- At \\( t = t_1 \\), the intervention by \\( N \\) changes \\( w(t) \\) to \\( u(t) = N w(t) \\). This further transforms the amplitude, frequency, and phase of \\( w(t) \\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate \\( u(T) \\):\n\n- For \\( T > t_1 \\), the value of \\( u(T) \\) will be influenced by the cumulative effect of both \\( M \\) and \\( N \\). Specifically, \\( u(T) \\) will be a function of how \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) modify the amplitude, frequency, and phase of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nSince \\( u(T) \\) is influenced by the transformations applied by \\( M \\) and \\( N \\), it cannot depend solely on the original \\( \\omega \\). The characteristics of \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) play a crucial role in determining the exact form of \\( u(T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
