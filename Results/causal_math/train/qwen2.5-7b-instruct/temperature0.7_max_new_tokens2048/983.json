This implies that \\( k(s) \\) affects only the value of \\( g(s) \\) at \\( s_0 \\), but does not change the form of \\( g(s) \\) elsewhere. Therefore, \\( g'(s) \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   g'(s) = \n   \\begin{cases} \n   g(s)k(s) & \\text{if } s = s_0 \\\\\n   g(s) & \\text{if } s \\neq s_0 \n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Effect on \\( F(z) \\)**: Now, we need to determine how this affects the integral for \\( F(z) \\):\n   \\[\n   F'(z) = \\int_C g'(s) e^{zs} ds\n   \\]\n   Since \\( g'(s) = g(s)k(s) \\) only at \\( s = s_0 \\), the integral can be split into two parts:\n   \\[\n   F'(z) = \\int_{C \\setminus \\{s_0\\}} g(s) e^{zs} ds + g(s_0)k(s_0) e^{zs_0} \\int_C \\delta(s - s_0) ds\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\delta(s - s_0) \\) is the Dirac delta function, which is 0 everywhere except at \\( s = s_0 \\), where it is infinite, and its integral over any interval containing \\( s_0 \\) is 1.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The term \\( g(s_0)k(s_0) e^{zs_0} \\) represents the contribution from the modification at \\( s_0 \\). Therefore, \\( F'(z) \\) is not solely dependent on the initial form of \\( g(s) \\); it also depends on the value of \\( k(s) \\) at \\( s_0 \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
