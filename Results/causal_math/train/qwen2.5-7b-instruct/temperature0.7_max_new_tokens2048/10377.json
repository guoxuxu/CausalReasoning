This means that \\( H(s) \\) is not simply equal to \\( F(s) \\), but rather it is the product of \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer to the question \"Will \\( H(s) = F(s) \\) hold without any additional operations?\" is no.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: \n   - \\( h(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n   - This transforms the time-domain function \\( f(t) \\) into the frequency-domain function \\( F(s) \\).\n\n2. **Convolution Operation**:\n   - Convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain.\n   - When you convolve \\( f(t) \\) with \\( g(t) \\), the resulting function is \\( (f * g)(t) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of the convolution \\( (f * g)(t) \\) is given by \\( F(s)G(s) \\).\n\n3. **Given Information**:\n   - We have \\( f(t) \\rightarrow F(s) \\) which means \\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} \\).\n   - Similarly, \\( g(t) \\rightarrow G(s) \\) which means \\( G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} \\).\n   - The convolution of \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) results in \\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\).\n\n4. **Question Analysis**:\n   - The question asks if \\( H(s) = F(s) \\) holds without any additional operations.\n   - From the properties of the Laplace transform, we know that \\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\), not just \\( F(s) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - For \\( H(s) = F(s) \\) to hold, \\( G(s) \\) must be 1 for all \\( s \\).\n   - However, there is no information given that suggests \\( G(s) = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
