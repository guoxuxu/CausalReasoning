    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace Transform is a powerful tool for solving linear differential equations. It converts differential equations into algebraic equations in the s-domain.\n\n2. **Application to Second-Order ODE**: For the given second-order ODE:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p \\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0,\n   \\]\n   applying the Laplace Transform yields an algebraic equation in terms of \\(Y(s)\\), where \\(Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}\\).\n\n3. **Initial Conditions**: To solve the transformed equation, initial conditions \\(y(0)\\) and \\(y'(0)\\) are necessary. These conditions are crucial because the Laplace Transform of the derivatives depends on these initial values.

However, the process of finding \\(Y(s)\\) inherently involves the initial conditions \\(y(0)\\) and \\(y'(0)\\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Initial Conditions**: The solution \\(y(t)\\) obtained from the inverse Laplace Transform will be unique if the initial conditions \\(y(0)\\) and \\(y'(0)\\) are specified. Without these initial conditions, the solution would contain arbitrary constants, leading to a family of solutions rather than a unique one.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, to obtain a unique solution \\(y(t)\\) at any \\(t > 0\\) using the Laplace Transform method, the initial conditions \\(y(0)\\) and \\(y'(0)\\) must be known.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer to the question is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
