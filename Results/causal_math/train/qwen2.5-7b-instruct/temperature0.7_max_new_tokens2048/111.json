    "To determine if the system's state \\(z(T)\\) at time \\(T\\) depends solely on \\(i\\omega\\) and not on \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\beta\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Differential Equation Analysis:**\n   - We start with the differential equation \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\).\n   - This is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation.\n   - The general solution to this equation is \\(z(t) = C e^{i\\omega t}\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n2. **Transformation \\(h(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z\\):**\n   - Applying the transformation \\(h(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z\\), we substitute \\(z(t) = C e^{i\\omega t}\\) into it.\n   - Thus, \\(h(z(t)) = C e^{\\alpha t} e^{i\\omega t} = C e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)t}\\).\n\n3. **Intervention Transformation \\(j(z) = e^{\\beta t}z\\):**\n   - An additional transformation \\(j(z) = e^{\\beta t}z\\) is applied at time \\(t_1 < T\\).\n   - For simplicity, assume \\(j(z(t))\\) is applied at \\(t = t_1\\).

    "To determine whether the system's state \\(z(T)\\) at time \\(T\\) solely depends on \\(i\\omega\\) and not on \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\beta\\), let's analyze the transformations and the governing differential equation step by step.\n\n1. **Initial System Dynamics**: The original system is governed by the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\n   \\]\n   This is a first-order linear differential equation.
