Given that \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\), we know that \\( g(z) \\) is also an entire function because the integral of an entire function over a path in the complex plane is well-defined.\n\n3. **Path Independence**: For functions of a complex variable, the integral of an analytic function (like \\( e^{iz} \\)) over a closed loop is zero due to Cauchy's theorem.

This is because the antiderivative of \\( e^{iz} \\) will have different values for different paths, even if they start and end at the same points.
