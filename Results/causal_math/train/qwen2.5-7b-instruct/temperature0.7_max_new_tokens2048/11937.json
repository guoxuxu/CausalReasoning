    "Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Original Function**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) is a complex exponential function with a real frequency parameter \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\xi) \\) of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} e^{i \\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i (\\omega - \\xi) t} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluating the Fourier Transform**: The integral above is the definition of the Dirac delta function, which is non-zero only when its argument is zero. Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\xi) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega \\).\n\n4. **Interpreting the Result**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) results in a Dirac delta function \\( 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\). This means that the frequency content of the signal is concentrated exactly at \\( \\omega \\).\n\n5. **Inference of Original Frequency**: Given the transformed state \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\xi) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\), we can see that the peak of the Fourier transform occurs at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\). This indicates that the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) can be precisely inferred from the Fourier transform.\n\nTherefore, based on the transformed state \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\), we can precisely infer the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) of \\( z(t) \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
