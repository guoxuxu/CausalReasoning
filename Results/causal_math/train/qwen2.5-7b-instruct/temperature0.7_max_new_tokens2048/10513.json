    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace Transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Given Transformation**: We have a modified signal \\( f(t) = e^{at} g(t) \\), where \\( g(t) \\) is the original signal.\n\n3. **Applying the Laplace Transform**: To find the Laplace Transform of \\( f(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at} g(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{at} g(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-a)t} g(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Recognizing the Shift**: The integral can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-a)t} g(t) \\, dt = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s-a)\n   \\]\n   Here, we see that the Laplace Transform of \\( e^{at} g(t) \\) is \\( G(s-a) \\), where \\( G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} \\).\n\n5. **Domain of Convergence**: The domain of convergence for the Laplace Transform \\( G(s) \\) is determined by the region of convergence (ROC) for \\( g(t) \\). When we shift the argument from \\( s \\) to \\( s-a \\), the ROC shifts accordingly but does not change its width or shape; it simply moves along the real axis.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the domain of convergence for \\( F(s) \\) is indeed shifted by \\( a \\) compared to \\( G(s) \\).\n\nOutput in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
