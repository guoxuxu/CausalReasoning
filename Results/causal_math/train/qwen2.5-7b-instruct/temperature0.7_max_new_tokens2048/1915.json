    "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine if the end state \\( z(T) \\) depends solely on \\( D \\) or also on \\( F \\) and \\( G \\).\n\n1. **Initial State**: The initial state of the system is given by \\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt} \\), where \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) are matrices, and \\( t \\) is time.\n\n2. **Transformation Analysis**:\n   - The first transformation is \\( h(z) = e^{Ft}z \\). Applying this transformation to the initial state gives us \\( h(z) = e^{Ft}(Ce^{Dt}) = Ce^{(D+F)t} \\).\n   - At a specific time \\( t_1 < T \\), the second transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Gt}z \\) is applied.
