This suggests that the functions \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) are likely to be of the form of damped sinusoidal functions, which can be generally written as:\n   \\[\n   x(t) = A_1 e^{-\\lambda t} \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi_1)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y(t) = A_2 e^{-\\lambda t} \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi_2)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Applying the Laplace Transform**:\n   - For \\( x(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{A_1 e^{-\\lambda t} \\cos(\\omega t + \\phi_1)\\}(s)\n     \\]\n     Using the properties of the Laplace transform for exponential and cosine functions, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\}(s) = \\frac{A_1 (\\lambda + s)}{(s + \\lambda)^2 + \\omega^2}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( y(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{A_2 e^{-\\lambda t} \\sin(\\omega t + \\phi_2)\\}(s)\n     \\]\n     Similarly, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s) = \\frac{A_2 \\omega}{(s + \\lambda)^2 + \\omega^2}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combining the Results**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\}(s) + i \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s)\n     \\]\n     Substituting the results from above:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\frac{A_1 (\\lambda + s)}{(s + \\lambda)^2 + \\omega^2} + i \\frac{A_2 \\omega}{(s + \\lambda)^2 + \\omega^2}\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\frac{A_1 (\\lambda + s) + i A_2 \\omega}{(s + \\lambda)^2 + \\omega^2}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Effect of Damping Constant \\(\\lambda\\)**: Notice that the denominator \\((s + \\lambda)^2 + \\omega^2\\) directly depends on \\(\\lambda\\).
