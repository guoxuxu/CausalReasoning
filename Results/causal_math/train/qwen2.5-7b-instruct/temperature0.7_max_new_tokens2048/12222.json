    "To determine if the end state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is influenced only by \\( A \\) and not by \\( B \\) or \\( C \\), we need to carefully analyze how each transformation affects the function \\( z(t) \\).\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The original function is given by:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{At} + i \\int_0^t e^{(A-1)s} ds\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the integral part:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^t e^{(A-1)s} ds = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(A-1)s}}{A-1} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{e^{(A-1)t} - 1}{A-1}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the function becomes:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{At} + i \\frac{e^{(A-1)t} - 1}{A-1}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Transformation \\( g(t, z) = e^{Bt} z \\)**: Applying this transformation at any time \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) \\rightarrow z(t) e^{Bt}\n   \\]\n   This transformation scales the entire function by \\( e^{Bt} \\).
