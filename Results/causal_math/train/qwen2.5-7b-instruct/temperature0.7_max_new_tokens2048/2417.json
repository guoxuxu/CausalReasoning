    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step.\n\n1. **Given Equation**: The system is described by the partial differential equation \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu + p\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator, and \\(p\\) is a control function.\n\n2. **Initial Condition**: The control function \\(p\\) is set as a constant value at \\(t = 0\\) and remains constant thereafter.\n\n3. **Transformation**: We apply the Laplace transform to \\(u(t)\\). The Laplace transform of \\(u(t)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(u(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}u(t) \\, dt = U(s)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Constant Control Function**: Since \\(p\\) is constant for all \\(t\\), let's denote this constant value by \\(p_0\\). Thus, the equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu + p_0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Laplace Transform Application**: Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\mathcal{L}(Lu) + \\mathcal{L}(p_0)\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Laplace transform, this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   sU(s) - u(0) = L U(s) + \\frac{p_0}{s}\n   \\]\n   Rearranging terms, we have:\n   \\[\n   (s - L)U(s) = u(0) + \\frac{p_0}{s}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   U(s) = \\frac{u(0)}{s - L} + \\frac{p_0}{s(s - L)}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Comparison with Time-Varying \\(p\\)**: If \\(p\\) were to vary over time, say \\(p(t)\\), then the equation would be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu + p(t)\n   \\]\n   Taking the Laplace transform again:\n   \\[\n   sU(s) - u(0) = L U(s) + \\mathcal{L}(p(t))\n   \\]\n   This would yield a different expression for \\(U(s)\\) depending on the specific form of \\(p(t)\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since \\(p\\) is constant, the resulting \\(U(s)\\) does not depend on the specific form of \\(p(t)\\) after \\(t = 0\\). However, if \\(p(t)\\) varies over time, the Laplace transform \\(U(s)\\) would generally differ due to the additional term involving \\(\\mathcal{L}(p(t))\\).\n\nTherefore, the Laplace transform of \\(u(t)\\) at some \\(s = S\\) will not be the same if \\(p\\) is varied over time compared to when \\(p\\) is a constant value.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
