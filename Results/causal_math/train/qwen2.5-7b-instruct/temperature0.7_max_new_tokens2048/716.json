    "To determine if an intervention in the form of multiplying \\( z(t) \\) by \\( e^{bt} \\) has occurred based on the Fourier transform result, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Fourier Transform**: Start with the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\omega t} e^{at} dt\n   \\]\n   Simplify the integrand:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{(a-i\\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges for \\( \\text{Re}(a) < \\omega \\). The result is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{a - i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Intervention Scenario**: If \\( z(t) \\) is intervened upon by multiplying it by \\( e^{bt} \\), the new function becomes \\( y(t) = e^{bt} z(t) = e^{(a+b)t} \\). The Fourier transform of \\( y(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{y}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\omega t} e^{(a+b)t} dt\n   \\]\n   Simplify the integrand:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{y}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{(a+b-i\\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges for \\( \\text{Re}(a+b) < \\omega \\). The result is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{y}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{a + b - i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Comparison**: Compare the Fourier transforms \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\) and \\( \\hat{y}(\\omega) \\):\n   - \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{a - i\\omega} \\)\n   - \\( \\hat{y}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{a + b - i\\omega} \\)\n\n4. **Determine Intervention**: To determine if an intervention has occurred, check if \\( \\hat{y}(\\omega) \\) is a simple shift in the exponent of \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\).

    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Original Function and Fourier Transform**:\n   - The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\omega t} e^{at} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{(a-i\\omega)t} dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral converges if the real part of \\( a - i\\omega \\) is negative, which means the real part of \\( a \\) must be less than the real part of \\( \\omega \\). Assuming this condition is met, the result of the Fourier transform is:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{a - i\\omega}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Intervention and New Function**:\n   - If there is an intervention where \\( z(t) \\) is multiplied by \\( e^{bt} \\), the new function becomes \\( z'(t) = e^{(a+b)t} \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z'(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{z}'(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\omega t} e^{(a+b)t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{(a+b-i\\omega)t} dt\n     \\]\n   - Again, assuming the integral converges (real part of \\( a + b - i\\omega \\) is negative), the result is:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{z}'(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{a + b - i\\omega}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparison with Common Form**:\n   - A \"common form associated with a single exponential\" typically refers to the Fourier transform of a simple exponential function.\n   - For example, the Fourier transform of \\( e^{-\\alpha |t|} \\) (which is a decaying exponential) is a Lorentzian function, but for a simple single exponential like \\( e^{-\\alpha t} u(t) \\) (where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function), the Fourier transform is \\( \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha^2 + \\omega^2} \\).\n\n4. **Determining the Intervention**:\n   - If the Fourier transform after the intervention still takes a form that is recognizable as a single exponential (like \\( \\frac{1}{a + b - i\\omega} \\)), it indicates that the intervention did not fundamentally change the nature of the function to something other than a simple exponential.\n   - However, the specific form \\( \\frac{1}{a + b - i\\omega} \\) is directly related to the parameter shift from \\( a \\) to \\( a + b \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the form \\( \\frac{1}{a + b - i\\omega} \\), we can infer that the intervention indeed resulted in a simple exponential function, confirming that the intervention was a multiplication by \\( e^{bt} \\).\n\nThus, based on the Fourier transform results, we can determine that the intervention in the form of a multiplication by \\( e^{bt} \\) has occurred.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
