    "To determine if we can find the initial function \\( z_0(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) from observing \\( z(T) \\) at a later time \\( T \\), let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation**: The function \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z\n   \\]\n   This can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{z} = (i\\omega + \\lambda)z\n   \\]\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The transformation \\( T(z) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-\\lambda s} z(s) \\, ds\n   \\]\n   This integral transformation modifies the function \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Observation at Time \\( T \\)**: We observe the value of \\( z(T) \\) at a later time \\( T \\).\n\n4. **Inversion Problem**: To determine \\( z_0(t) \\) from \\( z(T) \\), we need to reverse the effect of the transformation \\( T(z) \\). However, the transformation involves integrating \\( z(s) \\) weighted by \\( e^{-\\lambda s} \\), which means that \\( z_0(t) \\) is not directly recoverable just from \\( z(T) \\).\n\n5. **Causality and Initial Condition**: The solution to the differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z_0 e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)t}\n   \\]\n   Applying the transformation \\( T(z) \\):\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-\\lambda s} z_0 e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)s} \\, ds = z_0 \\int_0^T e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)(s - s)} \\, ds = z_0 \\int_0^T e^{i\\omega s} \\, ds\n   \\]\n   Evaluating the integral:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = z_0 \\left[ \\frac{e^{i\\omega s}}{i\\omega} \\right]_0^T = z_0 \\left( \\frac{e^{i\\omega T} - 1}{i\\omega} \\right)\n   \\]\n   From this, it is clear that knowing \\( z(T) \\) alone does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\( z_0 \\) because \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( z_0 \\) and the specific form of the integral transformation.\n\nGiven this analysis, we cannot determine the initial function \\( z_0(t) \\) solely from observing \\( z(T) \\) at a later time \\( T \\) without additional information.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
