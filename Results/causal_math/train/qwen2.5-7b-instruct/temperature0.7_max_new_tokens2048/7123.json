According to the residue theorem, the integral around a closed contour is equal to \\( 2\\pi i \\) times the sum of the residues of the function at the poles inside the contour.\n\n3. **Deformable Contour**: If the contour is deformable and can be changed to avoid the poles, the integral over this new contour will be zero because there are no poles inside the contour. This is due to Cauchy's integral theorem which states that the integral of an analytic function over a closed contour is zero if the function is analytic everywhere inside and on the contour.\n\n4. **Dependence on Parameters**: The value of the integral after deforming the contour to avoid the poles will be independent of the original path and the parameter \\( a \\). It will only depend on the parameters \\( \\omega \\) and the deformation of the contour (which in this case does not contribute as the integral becomes zero).\n\nGiven these points, the value of the integral will indeed depend solely on \\( \\omega \\) and not on the original path or \\( a \\) once the contour is deformed to avoid the poles.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
