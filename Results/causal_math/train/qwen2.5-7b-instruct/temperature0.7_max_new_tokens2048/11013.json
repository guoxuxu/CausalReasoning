    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: \n   The given function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\). This represents a complex exponential function with a frequency component \\( \\omega \\) and an initial condition \\( z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**:\n   The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\):\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} z_0 \\, dt = z_0 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(i\\omega - s)t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges if the real part of \\( s \\) (denoted as Re(s)) is greater than \\( \\omega \\). Evaluating the integral:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = z_0 \\left[ \\frac{e^{(i\\omega - s)t}}{i\\omega - s} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n   \\]\n   As \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the term \\( e^{(i\\omega - s)t} \\) decays if Re(s) > \\( \\omega \\), so:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = z_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   The inverse Laplace transform of \\( Z(s) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{z_0}{s - i\\omega} \\right\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the known inverse Laplace transform property for a shifted exponential:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\right\\} = e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluating at Time T**:\n   If we apply the inverse Laplace transform at any time \\( t = T \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z_0 e^{i\\omega T}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The result of the inverse Laplace transform at any time \\( t = T \\) is indeed \\( z(T) \\). Thus, the function remains unchanged when transformed via the Laplace transform and then inverted back, provided that the conditions for the Laplace transform are met (Re(s) > \\( \\omega \\)).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
