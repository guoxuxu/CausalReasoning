Therefore, \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{2t\\} = s \\cdot \\mathcal{L}\\{t\\} = s \\cdot \\frac{1}{s^2} = \\frac{2}{s^2} \\).\n\n3. **Linear Transformation by Matrix \\( A \\)**:\n   - If \\( u(t) \\) undergoes a linear transformation by a matrix \\( A \\), then the transformed function is \\( Au(t) \\).\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( Au(t) \\) is \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Linear Transformation on Laplace Transform**:\n   - The Laplace Transform of a linearly transformed function \\( Au(t) \\) is \\( A \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} \\). This means \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} = A U(s) \\).\n\n5. **Does \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\) Reflect Only Properties of Matrix \\( A \\)?**:\n   - Yes, the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\) reflects only the properties of matrix \\( A \\) and not directly the original function \\( v(t) = t^2 \\).\n   - The relationship between \\( v(t) \\) and \\( u(t) \\) is through differentiation, but once \\( u(t) \\) is transformed by \\( A \\), the resulting Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} \\) is solely dependent on \\( A \\) and \\( U(s) \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Given Functions and Relations:**\n   - \\( v(t) = t^2 \\)\n   - \\( u(t) = v'(t) = 2t \\) (since the derivative of \\( t^2 \\) is \\( 2t \\))\n   - The Laplace Transform of the derivative of a function \\( f(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{f'(t)\\} = sF(s) - f(0)\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( u(t) = 2t \\) and we need to find its Laplace Transform.\n\n2. **Finding the Laplace Transform of \\( u(t) \\):**\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( u(t) = 2t \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{2t\\} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{s^2} = \\frac{2}{s^2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Linear Transformation by Matrix \\( A \\):**\n   - If \\( u(t) \\) undergoes a linear transformation by a matrix \\( A \\), then the new function is \\( Au(t) \\).\n   - We need to determine if the Laplace Transform of \\( Au(t) \\) reflects only the properties of matrix \\( A \\) without relating to the original \\( v(t) = t^2 \\).\n\n4. **Laplace Transform of \\( Au(t) \\):**\n   - The Laplace Transform of a linearly transformed function \\( Au(t) \\) can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} = A \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\frac{2}{s^2} \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{Au(t)\\} = A \\left( \\frac{2}{s^2} \\right)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( Au(t) \\) is indeed a reflection of the properties of matrix \\( A \\) applied to the Laplace Transform of \\( u(t) \\). It does not directly relate to the original function \\( v(t) = t^2 \\) except through the relationship \\( u(t) = v'(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
