    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The system starts with an initial function \\( g(t) = t^2 \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) = t^2 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\} = \\frac{2}{s^3}\n   \\]\n   This is the representation in the Laplace domain.\n\n3. **Intervention with Fourier Transform**: An intervention is made using the Fourier transform on some function \\( h(t) \\).
