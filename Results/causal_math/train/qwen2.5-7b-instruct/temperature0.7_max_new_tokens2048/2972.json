    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: The system is governed by the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) = t^2 \\).

High-order derivatives in the Laplace domain correspond to multiplying the Laplace transform by \\( s^n \\) for some integer \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Output at \\( t_2 \\)**: We know the system's output at \\( t_2 \\).

Specifically, we would need to know the exact form of the Laplace transform after each transformation and intervention.
