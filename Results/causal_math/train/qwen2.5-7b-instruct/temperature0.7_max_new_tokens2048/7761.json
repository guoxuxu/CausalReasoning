    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: We start with \\( z(0) = z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Mobius Transformation Application**: At \\( t = 0 \\), we apply the Mobius transformation \\( f(z) = \\frac{az + b}{cz + d} \\) to \\( z_0 \\), giving us:\n   \\[\n   w_0 = f(z_0) = \\frac{az_0 + b}{cz_0 + d}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Differential Equation**: The behavior of \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).
