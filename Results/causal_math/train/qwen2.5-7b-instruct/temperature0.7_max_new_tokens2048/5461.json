Let's denote the transformed state as \\(y(t) = g(x(t)) = Q^{-1}x(t)\\). We want to find out if the evolution of \\(y(t)\\) is equivalent to evolving \\(x_0\\) directly under the dynamics.\n\n4. **Differentiating the Transformed State**: To understand the evolution of \\(y(t)\\), we differentiate \\(y(t)\\) with respect to time:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{y}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} (Q^{-1}x(t)) = Q^{-1}\\dot{x}(t) = Q^{-1}Kx(t).\n   \\]\n   Since \\(x(t)\\) satisfies \\(\\dot{x}(t) = Kx(t)\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{y}(t) = K(Q^{-1}x(t)) = Ky(t).\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\(y(t)\\) also evolves according to the same dynamics \\(\\dot{y} = Ky\\).\n\n5. **Initial Condition for Transformed System**: The initial condition for the transformed system is \\(y(0) = Q^{-1}x_0\\).\n\n6. **Comparing Solutions**: The solutions to the differential equations \\(\\dot{x} = Kx\\) and \\(\\dot{y} = Ky\\) are both of the form \\(x(t) = e^{Kt}x_0\\) and \\(y(t) = e^{Kt}y(0)\\), respectively. Substituting the initial condition for \\(y(t)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = e^{Kt}Q^{-1}x_0.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The state \\(y(t)\\) at any time \\(t\\) is \\(e^{Kt}Q^{-1}x_0\\), which is not the same as \\(x(t) = e^{Kt}x_0\\) unless \\(Q = I\\) (the identity matrix). Therefore, the state \\(x(t)\\) obtained from evolving \\(x_0\\) directly under \\(\\dot{x} = Kx\\) is different from the state \\(x(t)\\) obtained by first applying the transformation \\(g(x) = Q^{-1}x\\) to \\(x_0\\) and then evolving it under \\(\\dot{x} = Kx\\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the final answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
