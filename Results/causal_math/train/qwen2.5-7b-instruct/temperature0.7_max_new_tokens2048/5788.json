    "To determine whether we can precisely determine the values of both the capacitance \\( C \\) and the inductance \\( L \\) from the measurement of the steady-state current \\( I(T) \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Circuit Configuration\n- We have a sinusoidal voltage source \\( V(t) = V_0 e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n- The original circuit consists of a capacitor \\( C \\) and a resistor \\( R \\).\n- An inductor \\( L \\) is introduced midway through the observation period.\n\n### Step 2: Complex Impedances\n- The impedance of the capacitor \\( Z_C \\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  Z_C = \\frac{1}{i \\omega C} = -i \\frac{1}{\\omega C}\n  \\]\n- The impedance of the inductor \\( Z_L \\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  Z_L = i \\omega L\n  \\]\n- The impedance of the resistor \\( R \\) remains \\( R \\).\n\n### Step 3: Total Impedance of the Circuit\nThe total impedance \\( Z_{total} \\) of the series circuit is the sum of the individual impedances:\n\\[\nZ_{total} = R + Z_C + Z_L = R - i \\frac{1}{\\omega C} + i \\omega L\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Steady-State Current\nThe steady-state current \\( I(T) \\) in the circuit can be found using Ohm's law in the frequency domain:\n\\[\nI(T) = \\frac{V_0}{Z_{total}} = \\frac{V_0}{R - i \\frac{1}{\\omega C} + i \\omega L}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Magnitude and Phase of the Steady-State Current\nThe magnitude and phase of the steady-state current depend on the values of \\( R \\), \\( C \\), and \\( L \\). Specifically:\n- The magnitude of \\( I(T) \\) will be influenced by the resistive component \\( R \\) and the reactive components \\( Z_C \\) and \\( Z_L \\).\n- The phase angle of \\( I(T) \\) will be influenced by the balance between the capacitive and inductive reactances.\n\n### Step 6: Determining \\( C \\) and \\( L \\)\nFrom the measured \\( I(T) \\):\n- Knowing \\( I(T) \\), \\( V_0 \\), and \\( R \\), we can derive expressions for the magnitude and phase.\n- However, the relationship between \\( I(T) \\), \\( C \\), and \\( L \\) is not uniquely invertible due to the quadratic nature of the equation involving \\( C \\) and \\( L \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven only the steady-state current \\( I(T) \\), it is not possible to precisely determine both \\( C \\) and \\( L \\) because there are two unknowns and typically only one measurement. Additional information or measurements would be needed to solve for both \\( C \\) and \\( L \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
