    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation**: The given equation is Laplace's equation \\(\\nabla^2 u = 0\\), which describes a steady-state, harmonic system in two dimensions.\n\n2. **Boundary Conditions and Transforms**: To solve Laplace's equation with specific boundary conditions, one common approach is to apply integral transforms such as the Fourier transform. This is often done to simplify the partial differential equation into a set of ordinary differential equations.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Application**: When applying the Fourier transform to the boundary conditions, we convert the spatial domain problem into a frequency domain problem. This transformation can help in solving the PDE more easily, especially if the boundary conditions have some periodicity or symmetry.\n\n4. **Determining the Specific Transform**: Given only the observed potential function \\(u(x, y)\\) without any additional information about the process used to derive it, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether the Fourier transform, Laplace transform, or both were applied to the boundary conditions. \n\n5. **Ambiguity in Identification**: The solution to Laplace's equation can be obtained using various methods, including Green's functions, separation of variables, or integral transforms like the Fourier transform.
