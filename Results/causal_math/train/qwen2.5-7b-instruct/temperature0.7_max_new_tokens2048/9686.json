This transformation does not inherently involve a Fourier transform; it could be any linear transformation.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform is a specific type of linear transformation that maps a function from its original domain (often time or space) into a representation in the frequency domain. It is characterized by its ability to decompose a signal into its constituent frequencies.\n\n3. **Observing Frequency Spectrum**: If we observe the frequency spectrum of \\(Y_i\\), we are essentially looking at the result of applying some kind of frequency analysis to \\(Y_i\\).
