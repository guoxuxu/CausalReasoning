    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Equation**: The Laplace equation \\(\\nabla^2 u = 0\\) governs steady-state heat conduction in a homogeneous medium without sources or sinks. In two dimensions, it simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} = 0.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: The Fourier transform is often used to solve partial differential equations like the Laplace equation by converting them into algebraic equations. For the boundary conditions, if \\(h(x, y)\\) is the initial temperature distribution along the boundary, its Fourier transform \\(g(s)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   g(s) = \\mathcal{F}\\{h(x, y)\\}(s).\n   \\]\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions and Transformations**: The specific form of the boundary condition \\(h(x, y)\\) influences the solution \\(u(x, y)\\).
