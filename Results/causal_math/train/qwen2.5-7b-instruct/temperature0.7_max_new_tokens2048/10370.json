    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's find \\( H(s) \\) for the original function \\( h(t) = \\frac{1}{t} \\):\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} \\frac{1}{t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral does not converge in the usual sense for all \\( s \\), but we can consider its principal value or use the concept of the Cauchy principal value (PV).\n\n2. Now, let's consider the function \\( f(t) = t^2 \\). If we apply \\( f(t) \\) to \\( h(t) \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   h(f(t)) = \\frac{1}{t^2}\n   \\]\n   The transformed integral would be:\n   \\[\n   H_f(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} \\frac{1}{t^2} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. Next, let's consider the function \\( g(t) = \\sin(t) \\).

To determine if we can distinguish between \\( H_f(s) \\) and \\( H_g(s) \\) based solely on \\( H(s) \\), we need to analyze the nature of these integrals.\n\n5. Both \\( H_f(s) \\) and \\( H_g(s) \\) involve integrating functions that are more complex than \\( H(s) \\). Specifically, \\( \\frac{1}{t^2} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{\\sin(t)} \\) have different behaviors as \\( t \\to 0 \\) and \\( t \\to \\infty \\).\n\n6.
