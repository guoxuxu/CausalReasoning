Therefore, the effect of scaling \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) by \\( k \\) can be seen in \\( g(z) \\) as a multiplication by \\( k \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\).\n\n7. Since the scaling is applied at \\( t_1 \\) and the effect is visible in the integral from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, it will indeed be directly observable in \\( g(z) \\) at any later time \\( T > t_1 \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To determine if the scaling of \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) by a constant factor \\( k \\) will be directly observable in \\( g(z) \\) at any later time \\( T > t_1 \\), let's reason through the given function and the effect of scaling.\n\n1. **Original Function**: \n   \\[ g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{st} z(t) \\, dt \\]\n\n2. **Scaling Operation**:\n   If \\( z(t) \\) is scaled by a constant factor \\( k \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), then for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the new function becomes \\( z'(t) = k \\cdot z(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\) and remains unchanged for \\( t < t_1 \\).\n\n3. **New Function with Scaling**:\n   The transformed function \\( g(z') \\) after scaling would be:\n   \\[\n   g(z') = \\int_0^\\infty e^{st} z'(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Since \\( z'(t) = k \\cdot z(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   g(z') = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{st} z(t) \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^\\infty e^{st} (k \\cdot z(t)) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   g(z') = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{st} z(t) \\, dt + k \\int_{t_1}^\\infty e^{st} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparison with Original \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   The original \\( g(z) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{st} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This can be split similarly as:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{st} z(t) \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^\\infty e^{st} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n5. **Observing the Effect**:\n   - The first part of both integrals is identical.\n   - The second part of \\( g(z') \\) is \\( k \\) times the corresponding part of \\( g(z) \\).\n\nThus, the scaling factor \\( k \\) will only affect the second integral starting from \\( t_1 \\). For \\( T > t_1 \\), the term involving \\( k \\) will be present in the integral from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\), making the effect of scaling directly observable in \\( g(z) \\) at any time \\( T > t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
