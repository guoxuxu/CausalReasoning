However, the fundamental form of the Laplace Transform for \\( t^2 \\) remains unchanged except for this additional term.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The Laplace Transform does indeed change when a constant \\( k \\) is added to \\( t^2 \\), but the change is not significant in the sense that it doesn't alter the basic structure of the transform for \\( t^2 \\); it merely adds a new term.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Function and Laplace Transform**:\n   - The initial function is \\( f(t) = t^2 \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^2 dt\n     \\]\n   - Using the known formula for the Laplace transform of \\( t^n \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{t^n\\} = \\frac{n!}{s^{n+1}}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\} = \\frac{2!}{s^3} = \\frac{2}{s^3}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Modified Function and Laplace Transform**:\n   - The modified function is \\( f_k(t) = t^2 + k \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( f_k(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{f_k(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2 + k\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\} + \\mathcal{L}\\{k\\}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( k \\) is a constant, its Laplace transform is:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{k\\} = k \\cdot \\mathcal{L}\\{1\\} = k \\cdot \\frac{1}{s}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{f_k(t)\\} = \\frac{2}{s^3} + \\frac{k}{s}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - The Laplace transform of the original function \\( f(t) = t^2 \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of the modified function \\( f_k(t) = t^2 + k \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} + \\frac{k}{s} \\).\n   - Clearly, these two transforms are different because of the additional term \\( \\frac{k}{s} \\).\n\n4. **Significant Change**:\n   - The addition of a constant \\( k \\) to \\( f(t) \\) changes the Laplace transform significantly because the term \\( \\frac{k}{s} \\) introduces a new component to the transform.\n\nTherefore, the Laplace Transform does change significantly if applied after \\( t \\) has evolved over time with the intervention of adding a constant \\( k \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
