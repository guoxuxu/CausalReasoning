Without additional information about whether \\( h(X) \\) was applied, we cannot determine the exact original state \\( X_0 \\).\n\n3. **Determining \\( X_0 \\)**: To determine the original state \\( X_0 \\), we would need to know whether the transformation was applied.

The drift and diffusion coefficients remain the same, but the initial condition changes from \\( X_0 \\) to \\( X_0 + k \\).\n\n4. **Determining the Initial Condition**: Given \\( X(t) \\), the observed state at time \\( t \\), we can't directly determine the initial state \\( X_0 \\) because both \\( X_0 \\) and \\( X_0 + k \\) would evolve into the same \\( X(t) \\) under the same SDE (assuming no information about the specific path of the Brownian motion \\( W_t \\)).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about the specific path of the Brownian motion or other constraints, it is impossible to precisely determine the original state \\( X_0 \\) from \\( X(t) \\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
