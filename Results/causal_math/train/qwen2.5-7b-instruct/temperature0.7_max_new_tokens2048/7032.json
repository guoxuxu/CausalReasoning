  "Question Type": "from effect to cause with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Although the Fourier transform indicates a shift from \\\\( w \\\\) to \\\\( w + a \\\\), multiple interventions (like different phase shifts or added frequencies) could yield the same transformation effect. Without additional data, the specific intervention of multiplying by \\\\( e^{iat} \\\\) cannot be uniquely identified.",
