However, the intervention \\( g(z) = z^2 f(z) \\) changes the form of the function. To find the evolution of \\( g(z) \\), we need to consider how \\( g(z) \\) transforms under the same differential equation. The differential equation for \\( g(z) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dg}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz}(z^2 f(z)) = 2zf(z) + z^2 \\frac{df}{dz} = 2zf(z) + z^2 (izf(z)) = (2 + iz^3)f(z)\n   \\]\n   This new differential equation shows that the form of \\( g(z) \\) will evolve differently from \\( f(z) \\).\n\n5. **Fourier Transform Dependence**: The Fourier transform \\( F(g)(s) \\) depends not only on the original differential equation but also on the specific form of the intervention \\( g(z) \\). The intervention \\( g(z) = z^2 f(z) \\) introduces additional terms that affect the Fourier transform.\n\nGiven these steps, the Fourier transform of the resultant function at a later time \\( t \\) will indeed depend on the original differential equation, but it will also depend on the specific form of the intervention \\( g(z) = z^2 f(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
