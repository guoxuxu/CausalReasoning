    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Potential Function Analysis**:\n   The potential function given is \\( V(x) = -\\alpha x^2 + \\beta x^4 \\). This is a double-well potential with minima at \\( x = 0 \\) and \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}} \\).\n\n2. **Dynamics of the System**:\n   The dynamics of the particle are governed by the force derived from this potential. The force \\( F(x) \\) is given by the negative gradient of the potential:\n   \\[\n   F(x) = -\\frac{dV(x)}{dx} = 2\\alpha x - 4\\beta x^3\n   \\]\n   The equation of motion for the particle is:\n   \\[\n   m\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 2\\alpha x - 4\\beta x^3\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle.\n\n3. **Perturbation Analysis**:\n   We are considering a perturbation \\( g(x) = x + \\delta \\) applied to the initial position \\( x_0 \\). This means the new initial position is \\( x_0 + \\delta \\).\n\n4. **Behavior Under Perturbation**:\n   To investigate if the trajectory remains the same, we need to consider how the system evolves under the perturbed initial condition. The force and thus the acceleration depend only on the position \\( x \\) and not explicitly on time (assuming no external forces other than the potential). Therefore, the differential equation governing the motion does not change form due to the perturbation; it still depends on \\( x \\) and not on \\( t \\).\n\n5. **Long-Term Behavior**:\n   The key point here is that the system's evolution is deterministic and depends only on the current state (position and velocity) and the potential. Since the potential function \\( V(x) \\) is the same for both the unperturbed and perturbed systems, the qualitative behavior (such as whether the particle stays in one well or transitions between wells) should be similar provided the perturbation \\( \\delta \\) is small enough that it doesn't cause the particle to escape the potential wells.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   For a small perturbation \\( \\delta \\), the trajectory of the particle starting at \\( x_0 + \\delta \\) will be very close to the trajectory starting at \\( x_0 \\), especially over short times. Over long times, the difference might accumulate, but for sufficiently small \\( \\delta \\), the trajectories can be considered the same up to a small deviation.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer to the question is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n\nThe correct interpretation based on the above analysis is that while the trajectories will be very close for small \\( \\delta \\), they will not be exactly the same due to the inherent nonlinearity of the system and the accumulation of small differences over time."
