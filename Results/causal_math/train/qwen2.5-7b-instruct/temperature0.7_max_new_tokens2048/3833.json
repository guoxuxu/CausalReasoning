    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the System Dynamics**:\n   - We have a linear system described by the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx + z(t) \\).\n   - Here, \\( D \\) is a constant matrix, and \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is an input that depends on the angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Linear vs Nonlinear Dependence**:\n   - For a system to be considered linear, its behavior must satisfy the superposition principle (homogeneity and additivity). This means that the response to a sum of inputs is the sum of the responses to each input separately.\n   - In this case, the term \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) introduces a sinusoidal input into the system. The system itself is linear because it is described by a linear differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\n3. **Dependence on \\( \\omega \\)**:\n   - The presence of \\( \\omega \\) in \\( z(t) \\) does not make the system nonlinear. Instead, it modifies the form of the input signal. The system's dynamics will still be linear, but the specific solution \\( x(t) \\) will depend on \\( \\omega \\) because the input is a complex exponential with frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n4. **Solution Form**:\n   - Given the form of \\( z(t) \\), the solution \\( x(t) \\) to the differential equation can be found using methods for solving non-homogeneous linear differential equations. Typically, the solution would involve finding both the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n   - The particular solution will directly depend on \\( \\omega \\) due to the form of \\( z(t) \\), but this dependency does not make the overall system nonlinear; it just means that the system's response varies with \\( \\omega \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The system remains linear regardless of the value of \\( \\omega \\).
