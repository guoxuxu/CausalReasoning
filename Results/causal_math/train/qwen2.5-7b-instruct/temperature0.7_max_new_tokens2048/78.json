For a complex function \\( Z(\\omega) = X(\\omega) + iY(\\omega) \\), the inverse transform is:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(Z(\\omega)) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (X(\\omega) + iY(\\omega)) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n     \\]\n     This can also be separated into real and imaginary parts:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega + i \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} Y(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega \\right]\n     \\]\n\n3. **Loss of Information**:\n   - To determine if there is any loss of information, consider the properties of the Fourier Transform. The Fourier Transform is a linear operation that maps a function from the time domain to the frequency domain. It does not inherently lose information about the original function; however, the reconstruction process relies on both the magnitude and phase information of the Fourier Transform.\n   - If only the magnitude (or only the phase) of the Fourier Transform is known, information about the original function could be lost. However, if both magnitude and phase are available, it is theoretically possible to reconstruct the original function without loss of information.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that both the magnitude and phase of the Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z(t)) \\) are preserved and available for reconstruction, the original function \\( z(t) \\) can indeed be precisely reconstructed without any loss of information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
