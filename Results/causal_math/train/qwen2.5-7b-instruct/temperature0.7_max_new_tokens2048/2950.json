    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Transformation Effect**: The transformation \\( z \\to e^{kt} z \\) scales every point \\( z \\) on the complex plane by a factor of \\( e^{kt} \\). This means that if we consider a function \\( f(z) \\), under this transformation, it becomes \\( f(e^{kt}z) \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: When considering the integral \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) over a closed contour \\( C \\), applying the transformation results in:\n   \\[\n   \\int_C f(e^{kt}z) \\, dz\n   \\]\n   To understand how this integral changes, we need to change variables. Let \\( w = e^{kt}z \\).

The transformation \\( z \\to e^{kt}z \\) modifies both the function and the contour in a way that depends on \\( k \\) and \\( T \\).

    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Transformation Application**: The transformation given is \\( z \\to e^{kt} z \\).
