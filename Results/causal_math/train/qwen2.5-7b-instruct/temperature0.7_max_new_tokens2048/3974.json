    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function \\(z(t)\\):**\n   - The function given is \\(z(t) = e^{it}\\).\n   - This is a complex exponential function, which traces out a unit circle in the complex plane as \\(t\\) varies.\n\n2. **Transformation \\(g(z)\\):**\n   - The transformation is defined as \\(g(z) = \\left(\\int_0^t e^{is} ds\\right) * z\\).\n   - First, let's evaluate the integral part:\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^t e^{is} ds = \\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i}\n     \\]\n   - So, the transformation becomes:\n     \\[\n     g(z) = \\left(\\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i}\\right) * z\n     \\]\n\n3. **Applying \\(g(z)\\) to \\(z(t)\\):**\n   - If we apply \\(g(z)\\) to \\(z(t)\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     g(z(t)) = \\left(\\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i}\\right) * e^{it}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this expression:\n     \\[\n     g(z(t)) = \\left(\\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i}\\right) * e^{it} = \\frac{(e^{it} - 1)e^{it}}{i} = \\frac{e^{2it} - e^{it}}{i}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Observing \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\):**\n   - At \\(t = T\\), \\(z(T) = e^{iT}\\).\n   - To determine if we can deduce the original form of \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = 0\\) from \\(z(T)\\), we need to consider the effect of the transformation \\(g(z)\\).\n\n5. **Effect of Transformation on \\(z(t)\\):**\n   - The transformation \\(g(z)\\) modifies \\(z(t)\\) but does not change its fundamental periodic nature (since it still traces a unit circle). However, it scales and shifts the phase of \\(z(t)\\).\n\n6. **Reversibility of the Transformation:**\n   - To reverse the transformation \\(g(z)\\), we would need to know the exact scaling factor and phase shift introduced by the integral term.\n   - Given that the integral term depends on the path from \\(0\\) to \\(t\\), and without additional information about the specific application of \\(g(z)\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine the original function form at \\(t = 0\\) just by observing \\(z(T)\\).\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\(z(t) = e^{it}\\), where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit and \\(t\\) is the real time variable.\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation \\(g(z)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\left(\\int_0^t e^{is} ds\\right) * z\n   \\]\n   Let's evaluate the integral part first:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^t e^{is} ds = \\left[\\frac{e^{is}}{i}\\right]_0^t = \\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i}\n   \\]\n   So, the transformation can be written as:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\left(\\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i}\\right) * z\n   \\]\n\n3. **Applying Transformation**: If \\(z(t) = e^{it}\\), then applying \\(g(z)\\):\n   \\[\n   g(e^{it}) = \\left(\\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i}\\right) * e^{it} = \\frac{(e^{it} - 1)e^{it}}{i} = \\frac{e^{2it} - e^{it}}{i}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Observing \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\)**: When we observe \\(z(T)\\) at some time \\(T\\), it will be:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{iT}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Reversing the Transformation**: To determine if we can deduce the original form of \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = 0\\) from observing \\(z(T)\\), we need to reverse the effect of \\(g(z)\\). However, the transformation \\(g(z)\\) involves an integral term that depends on \\(t\\), and the result is a complex function that multiplies \\(z(t)\\). Reversing this process would require knowing the exact form of the integral term, which we do not have without additional information about \\(g(z)\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without knowing the specific form of \\(g(z)\\) and its application, it is not possible to uniquely deduce the original function \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = 0\\) just by observing \\(z(T)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
