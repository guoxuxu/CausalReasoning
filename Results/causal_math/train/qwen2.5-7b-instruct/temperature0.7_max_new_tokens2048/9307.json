This introduces an additional term into the system.\n\n3. **Impact of Modification**: The introduction of \\(U\\) with kernel \\(M(s, t)\\) will affect the function \\(z(t)\\) after time \\(t_1\\). Specifically, it will modify the state of the system based on the new kernel \\(M(s, t)\\).\n\n4. **Final State Calculation**: To determine the final state at some future time \\(T\\), we need to consider both the original transformation and the modification. The final state \\(z(T)\\) will be:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = Tz(t_1) + Uz(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(Tz(t_1)\\) is the state of the system at \\(t_1\\) after applying the original transformation, and \\(Uz(t_1)\\) is the effect of the modification starting from \\(t_1\\).\n\n5. **Influence of \\(M(s, t)\\)**: Since \\(Uz(t_1)\\) directly incorporates the influence of the kernel \\(M(s, t)\\) from time \\(t_1\\) onwards, it means that the final state \\(z(T)\\) is indeed influenced by the kernel \\(M(s, t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the final state of the function at time \\(T\\) will be influenced by both the original kernel \\(K(s, t)\\) and the modified kernel \\(M(s, t)\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

This suggests that after time \\(t_1\\), the system's behavior will be influenced by both \\(K(s, t)\\) and \\(M(s, t)\\).\n\n4. **Post-Modification Evolution**: For \\(t > t_1\\), the evolution would now include contributions from both kernels. If we consider the effect of \\(M(s, t)\\) starting from \\(t_1\\), it would influence the subsequent evolution of \\(z(t)\\).\n\n5. **Influence of \\(M(s, t)\\)**: Since the introduction of \\(U\\) (with kernel \\(M(s, t)\\)) affects the system for \\(t > t_1\\), the final state of \\(z(t)\\) at any time \\(T\\) (where \\(T > t_1\\)) will indeed be influenced by the kernel \\(M(s, t)\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the final state of the function at time \\(T\\) cannot be said to be influenced solely by the original kernel \\(K(s, t)\\); it must also account for the effects of the modification introduced by \\(M(s, t)\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
