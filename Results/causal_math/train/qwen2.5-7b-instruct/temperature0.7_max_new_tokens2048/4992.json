For example, if \\( h(x) = e^{bx}f(x) \\) and both \\( g(x) \\) and \\( h(x) \\) are applied, the final Fourier Transform would be:\n   \\[\n   F(k) = F(k - \\frac{a}{2\\pi i}) \\text{ or } F(k - \\frac{b}{2\\pi i})\n   \\]\n   depending on which function was applied first. However, without additional information about the order of application, it is not straightforward to distinguish between these two shifts just from the final Fourier Transform.\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Information**: Given only the final \\( F(k) \\), there isn't enough information to determine with certainty whether one modulation, the other, or both were applied. The shift in the frequency domain due to each modulation is independent but does not provide a unique solution when combined.\n\nTherefore, based on the final \\( F(k) \\), we cannot accurately ascertain what modulations were applied (whether \\( g(x) \\), \\( h(x) \\), or both).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
