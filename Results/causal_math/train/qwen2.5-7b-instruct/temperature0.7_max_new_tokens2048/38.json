We need to determine if the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\), denoted as \\( Y(s) \\), allows us to exactly deduce \\( g(t) \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of \\( g(t) \\)**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) = t^2 \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\} = \\frac{2!}{s^3} = \\frac{2}{s^3}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Transformed Differential Equation**:\n   - Taking the Laplace transform of the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + y = g(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) + Y(s) = G(s)\n     \\]\n     Assuming zero initial conditions (i.e., \\( y(0) = 0 \\) and \\( y'(0) = 0 \\)), this simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     (s^2 + 1)Y(s) = G(s)\n     \\]\n     Therefore,\n     \\[\n     Y(s) = \\frac{G(s)}{s^2 + 1} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{s^3}}{s^2 + 1} = \\frac{2}{s^5 + s^3}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Inversion of Laplace Transform**:\n   - To find \\( y(t) \\) from \\( Y(s) \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( Y(s) \\). However, knowing \\( Y(s) \\) does not directly give us \\( g(t) \\) because \\( Y(s) \\) depends on both the forcing function \\( G(s) \\) and the system's dynamics represented by \\( s^2 + 1 \\).\n\n5. **Causal Inference**:\n   - The Laplace transform \\( Y(s) \\) contains information about the system's response to the input \\( g(t) \\). While it is possible to reconstruct \\( y(t) \\) from \\( Y(s) \\) using the inverse Laplace transform, the relationship between \\( Y(s) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) is indirect and involves the system's dynamics.\n   - Given only \\( Y(s) \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( g(t) \\) without additional information about the system's initial conditions and the form of the differential equation.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the Laplace transform \\( Y(s) \\) is a result of the convolution of the input \\( g(t) \\) with the system's impulse response, and it does not directly encode \\( g(t) \\) but rather the combined effect of \\( g(t) \\) and the system's behavior, we cannot exactly deduce \\( g(t) = t^2 \\) solely from \\( Y(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the System**: The system is described by the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + y = g(t)\n   \\]\n   where \\( g(t) = t^2 \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: Applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation, assuming zero initial conditions for simplicity, we get:\n   \\[\n   s^2 Y(s) + Y(s) = G(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( Y(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( y(t) \\), and \\( G(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\).\n\n3. **Transform of \\( g(t) \\)**: We know that \\( g(t) = t^2 \\). The Laplace transform of \\( t^2 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\} = \\frac{2!}{s^3} = \\frac{2}{s^3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( Y(s) \\)**: Substituting \\( G(s) \\) into the transformed differential equation:\n   \\[\n   s^2 Y(s) + Y(s) = \\frac{2}{s^3}\n   \\]\n   Factor out \\( Y(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   Y(s)(s^2 + 1) = \\frac{2}{s^3}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( Y(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{2}{s^5 (s^2 + 1)}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Inversion to Find \\( y(t) \\)**: To find \\( y(t) \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( Y(s) \\). This is a complex process involving partial fraction decomposition and known inverse transforms.\n\n6. **Causal Inference**: The key point here is whether we can exactly deduce \\( g(t) = t^2 \\) from \\( Y(s) \\). Since the Laplace transform is a linear operator and the inverse Laplace transform is unique (under certain conditions), if we have \\( Y(s) \\), we can indeed recover \\( y(t) \\). However, knowing \\( y(t) \\) does not directly give us \\( g(t) \\) without additional information because the differential equation relates \\( y(t) \\) to \\( g(t) \\).\n\n7. **Recovery of \\( g(t) \\)**: The original function \\( g(t) \\) that drives the differential equation can be recovered from \\( y(t) \\) through the differential equation itself. Knowing \\( y(t) \\) allows us to compute \\( g(t) \\) using:\n   \\[\n   g(t) = \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + y\n   \\]\n\nGiven the above steps, we can conclude that while the Laplace transform \\( Y(s) \\) provides information about \\( y(t) \\), it does not directly allow us to deduce \\( g(t) = t^2 \\) without solving the differential equation to find \\( y(t) \\) first.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
