    "Let's analyze this step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understand the given transform and its inverse:**\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) is given as \\( F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\).\n   - The inverse Laplace transform allows us to recover \\( f(t) \\) from \\( F(s) \\).\n\n2. **Given transformed function:**\n   - We have \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform:**\n   - To find \\( f(t) \\), we need to use the known inverse Laplace transforms.\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\) is \\( te^{ct} \\). This can be derived using standard tables of Laplace transforms.\n\n4. **Effect of modifying \\( f(t) \\) by \\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\):**\n   - If \\( f(t) \\) is modified by \\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\), then the new function is \\( h(t) = f(t)e^{ct} \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( h(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} h(t) dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)e^{ct} dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-c)t} f(t) dt = F(s-c)\n     \\]\n   - So, if \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\), then \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2} \\).\n\n5. **Comparison with the given \\( F(s) \\):**\n   - The given \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\) suggests that the original \\( f(t) \\) leads to this form after the Laplace transform.\n   - If we modify \\( f(t) \\) by \\( e^{ct} \\), we get \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2} \\), which is the Laplace transform of \\( t \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - From the form \\( \\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\), we can deduce that the original \\( f(t) \\) must be of the form \\( (t+c)e^{-ct} \\) (up to a constant multiple).\n   - However, knowing only \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\), we cannot definitively say if \\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\) was applied to \\( f(t) \\) because other functions could also lead to this form after transformation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if a modification by \\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\) was applied to some original \\( f(t) \\), we need to analyze the effect of such a modification on the Laplace transform.\n\n1. **Original Function and Transform**:\n   - Let's assume the original function is \\( f(t) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) is given by \\( F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Modification by \\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\)**:\n   - If \\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\) is applied to \\( f(t) \\), the new function becomes \\( h(t) = f(t) e^{ct} \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( h(t) \\) is then:\n     \\[\n     H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} h(t) dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) e^{ct} dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-c)t} f(t) dt.\n     \\]\n   - By the properties of the Laplace transform, this is equivalent to:\n     \\[\n     H(s) = F(s-c).\n     \\]\n\n3. **Given Transformed Function**:\n   - We are given \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\).\n   - If \\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\) was applied, then the transformed function would be \\( H(s) = F(s-c) = \\frac{1}{s^2} \\).\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - The given transformed function \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\) does not match the form \\( \\frac{1}{s^2} \\) unless \\( c = 0 \\).\n   - Therefore, we cannot ascertain that \\( g(t) = e^{ct} \\) was applied to \\( f(t) \\) based solely on the given \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{(s-c)^2} \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
