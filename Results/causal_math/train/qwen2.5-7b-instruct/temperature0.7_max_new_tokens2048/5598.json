    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step.\n\n1. **Differential Equation Analysis**:\n   The differential equation governing \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\n   \\]\n   This is a first-order linear differential equation. The solution to this equation can be found using separation of variables or recognizing it as an exponential growth/decay problem. The general solution is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0) e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   where \\( z(0) \\) is the initial condition at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**:\n   The integral transformation is given by:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\omega t} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Substituting the expression for \\( z(t) \\) into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{i\\omega t} z(0) e^{i\\omega t} \\, dt = z(0) \\int_0^T e^{2i\\omega t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Evaluating the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^T e^{2i\\omega t} \\, dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{2i\\omega t}}{2i\\omega} \\right]_0^T = \\frac{e^{2i\\omega T} - 1}{2i\\omega}\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = z(0) \\frac{e^{2i\\omega T} - 1}{2i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Deduction of \\( z(0) \\)**:\n   From the above expression, we see that \\( g(z) \\) depends on \\( z(0) \\). To determine if \\( z(0) \\) can be deduced uniquely from \\( z(T) \\), we need to express \\( z(T) \\) in terms of \\( z(0) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z(0) e^{i\\omega T}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( z(0) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(0) = z(T) e^{-i\\omega T}\n   \\]\n\nSince \\( z(0) \\) can be directly calculated from \\( z(T) \\) without needing the integral transformation \\( g(z) \\), the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
