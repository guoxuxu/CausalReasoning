So, the new state at \\( t_1 \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   z(t_1) = C (e^{At_1}x + e^{Bt_1}y)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evolution After Application**: After applying \\( C \\) at \\( t_1 \\), the system evolves according to the original dynamics. The state at any subsequent time \\( t > t_1 \\) is given by the same form but starting from the transformed state at \\( t_1 \\).\n\n4. **State at Time \\( T \\)**: To find the state at time \\( T \\), we need to consider the evolution from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\):\n   - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the state can be written as:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = e^{A(t-t_1)}C(e^{At_1}x + e^{Bt_1}y) + e^{B(t-t_1)}C(e^{At_1}x + e^{Bt_1}y)\n     \\]\n   - Specifically, at \\( T \\):\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}C(e^{At_1}x + e^{Bt_1}y) + e^{B(T-t_1)}C(e^{At_1}x + e^{Bt_1}y)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Dependency on Matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**: Notice that the expression for \\( z(T) \\) still involves the exponentials of matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), albeit through intermediate transformations involving \\( C \\). The dependency on \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) does not disappear because these matrices determine the form of the exponentials which are crucial for the state evolution.\n\nTherefore, even after applying the linear operator \\( C \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), the state \\( z(T) \\) remains dependent on the initial matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
