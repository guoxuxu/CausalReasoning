    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the eigenvalue equation \\(Av = \\lambda v\\), where \\(A\\) is a square matrix, \\(v\\) is an eigenvector, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the corresponding eigenvalue.\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: The transformation \\(g(v) = P^{-1}v\\) changes the basis of the vector space. This means we are expressing the vector \\(v\\) in terms of a new basis defined by the columns of \\(P\\).\n\n3. **New Vector Representation**: Let \\(v_0\\) be a vector in the original basis. When we apply the transformation, we get a new vector in the transformed basis, which we can denote as \\(v'\\).

However, this does not necessarily mean \\(v'\\) itself is an eigenvector of \\(A\\) in the original basis. It depends on whether \\(P\\) commutes with \\(A\\), i.e., \\(PA = AP\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: In general, applying the transformation \\(g(v) = P^{-1}v\\) does not guarantee that the eigenvectors remain the same in the new basis unless \\(P\\) commutes with \\(A\\). Without this condition, the eigenvectors will transform according to the similarity transformation \\(P^{-1}AP\\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

This means that \\( v' = P^{-1}v \\) is a new representation of the original vector \\( v \\) in the basis defined by the columns of \\( P \\).\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: When we apply the transformation, we get \\( v' = P^{-1}v_0 \\).\n\n4. **Eigenvalue Problem in New Basis**: We need to check if \\( v' \\) (or any vector transformed by \\( g \\)) remains an eigenvector of \\( A \\) in the original basis.\n\n5. **Transformed Eigenvalue Equation**: To see if \\( v' \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A \\), we substitute \\( v' \\) into the eigenvalue equation:\n   \\[\n   A(P^{-1}v) = \\lambda (P^{-1}v)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side using the properties of matrix multiplication:\n   \\[\n   P^{-1}A v = \\lambda P^{-1} v\n   \\]\n\n6. **Matrix Similarity**: The equation \\( P^{-1}A v = \\lambda P^{-1} v \\) can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   A v = \\lambda P (P^{-1} v)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( P (P^{-1} v) = v \\), it simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   A v = \\lambda v\n   \\]\n   which is the original eigenvalue equation.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The transformation \\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\) does not alter the fact that \\( v \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A \\) in the original basis. The eigenvector property holds true under this change of basis because the eigenvalue equation is preserved when both sides are multiplied by \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a vector \\( v_0 \\) and a matrix \\( A \\) such that \\( Av_0 = \\lambda v_0 \\). This means \\( v_0 \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation \\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\) changes the basis from the standard basis to a new basis defined by the columns of \\( P \\). So, if \\( v_0 \\) is transformed, it becomes \\( v' = P^{-1}v_0 \\).\n\n3. **Action of Matrix A on Transformed Vector**: When we apply \\( A \\) to the transformed vector \\( v' \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   Av' = A(P^{-1}v_0)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( Av_0 = \\lambda v_0 \\), we can rewrite this as:\n   \\[\n   Av' = A(P^{-1}v_0) = (PP^{-1})Av_0 = v_0 \\lambda\n   \\]\n   However, since \\( v' = P^{-1}v_0 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   Av' = \\lambda P^{-1}v_0 = \\lambda v'\n   \\]\n\n4. **Eigenvalue Problem in New Basis**: The equation \\( Av' = \\lambda v' \\) shows that \\( v' \\) is an eigenvector of \\( A \\) with the same eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\) in the new basis defined by \\( P \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, after applying the transformation \\( g(v) = P^{-1}v \\), the vector \\( v' = P^{-1}v_0 \\) is indeed an eigenvector of \\( A \\) in the new basis.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
