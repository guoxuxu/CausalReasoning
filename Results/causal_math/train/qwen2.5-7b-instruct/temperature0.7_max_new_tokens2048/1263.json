    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original function \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\). The Fourier transform of this function is well-known:\n   \\[ F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1 dt = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\]\n   This shows that the Fourier transform of \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\) is a delta function centered at \\(\\omega_0\\).\n\n2. Now, if we modify \\(z(t)\\) to \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega' t}\\) at some specific time \\(t = t_m\\), where \\(\\omega' \\neq \\omega\\), we need to consider how this affects the Fourier transform.\n\n3. The Fourier transform of a modified signal is generally not straightforward, especially when the modification occurs at a specific point. However, in this case, since the modification is instantaneous (occurring at a single point in time), it doesn't change the overall frequency content of the signal.\n\n4. The Fourier transform is a linear operation and integrates over all time. An instantaneous change at a single point does not contribute to the integral in a way that would create additional frequency components.\n\n5. Therefore, even with the modification, the resulting Fourier transform should still be a delta function centered at \\(\\omega'\\), not \\(\\omega\\). The original \\(\\omega\\) is no longer the center of the delta function because the signal has been changed to \\(e^{i\\omega' t}\\).\n\n6. The presence of the delta function at \\(\\omega\\) is no longer valid because the signal is now \\(e^{i\\omega' t}\\), not \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Fourier Transform:**\n   - The original function is \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\).\n   - Its Fourier transform is given by:\n     \\[\n     F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1 dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral does not converge in the usual sense, but if we consider the Dirac delta function representation for the Fourier transform of a constant (which is effectively a delta function at the frequency corresponding to the exponent), we have:\n     \\[\n     F(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n     \\]\n     where \\(\\omega_0\\) is the frequency of the exponential term.\n\n2. **Modified Function and Fourier Transform:**\n   - If the function is modified to \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega' t}\\) at some time \\(t\\) midpoint, we need to consider the effect on the Fourier transform.\n   - A sudden change in the function like this would introduce a discontinuity, which affects the Fourier transform significantly.\n   - The Fourier transform of a discontinuous function typically includes additional terms representing the discontinuity and its derivatives.\n\n3. **Effect of Introducing a New Frequency Component:**\n   - Introducing a new frequency component \\(e^{i\\omega' t}\\) at a specific point will create a new delta function contribution at \\(\\omega'\\).\n   - The original delta function at \\(\\omega_0\\) remains, but there will be an additional delta function at \\(\\omega'\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The spectrum \\(F(\\omega)\\) will no longer show only a delta function at the original \\(\\omega\\).
