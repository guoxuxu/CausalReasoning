    "To determine if the observed \\( z(T) \\) for \\( t_1 < T \\) depends only on the original differential equation and not on the transformations \\( T \\) or \\( U \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**: The given differential equation is \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z \\).
