    "To answer this question, let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( h(z) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\n2. **Poles of the Laplace Transform**: The poles of \\( H(s) \\) are the values of \\( s \\) for which \\( H(s) \\) becomes infinite. For the given problem, these poles are at \\( s = i\\omega \\).\n\n3. **Sinusoidal Functions and Laplace Transforms**: A purely sinusoidal function can be represented as either \\( \\cos(\\omega t) \\) or \\( \\sin(\\omega t) \\). The Laplace transforms of these functions are:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{\\cos(\\omega t)\\}(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + \\omega^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{\\sin(\\omega t)\\}(s) = \\frac{\\omega}{s^2 + \\omega^2}\n   \\]\n   Both of these transforms have poles at \\( s = \\pm i\\omega \\).\n\n4. **Implication of Poles**: The presence of poles at \\( s = i\\omega \\) suggests that the original function \\( h(t) \\) has components that could be related to a cosine or sine wave with frequency \\( \\omega \\). However, having poles at \\( s = i\\omega \\) does not definitively mean \\( h(t) \\) is purely sinusoidal. It could also include other terms or functions that contribute to the poles but do not necessarily make \\( h(t) \\) purely sinusoidal.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While the presence of poles at \\( s = i\\omega \\) indicates the possibility of sinusoidal components in \\( h(t) \\), it does not conclusively prove that \\( h(t) \\) is purely sinusoidal. There could be additional terms in \\( h(t) \\) that contribute to the poles without making the function purely sinusoidal.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
