    "To determine whether \\( T(\\lambda) \\) at \\( x = x_0 \\) depends solely on the properties of \\( f \\) and not on initial or boundary conditions, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Complex Analytic Function**: The function \\( z = f(x + iy) \\) is complex analytic, which means it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations and has a power series expansion around any point in its domain.\n\n2. **Real Part of \\( f \\)**: The real part of \\( f(x + iy) \\) is \\( u(x, y) = \\text{Re}(f(x + iy)) \\).
