These can be represented as additional terms in the transformed equation, such as \\( G(s) \\), which would need to be inverted back to the time domain using \\( L^{-1} \\).\n\n4. **Endpoint State**: The endpoint state \\( f(T) \\) is the value of the function at time \\( T \\). This is the result after all transformations and interventions have been applied.\n\n5. **Reversing Transformations**: To determine if any interventions occurred, we would need to know the original \\( F(s) \\) and compare it with the resulting \\( f(T) \\). If \\( f(T) \\) matches the expected result from \\( F(s) \\) without any modifications, then no interventions occurred.
