Substituting \\( G(s) \\) into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = (sI - M)^{-1}NG(s)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compare the Transforms**: Notice that the term \\((sI - M)^{-1}N\\) is a matrix that depends only on the system matrices \\( M \\) and \\( N \\), and not on the specific form of \\( f(t) \\). Therefore, the change in \\( f(t) \\) directly affects \\( F(s) \\) to become \\( G(s) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since \\( X(s) \\) is explicitly dependent on \\( F(s) \\) through the term \\((sI - M)^{-1}N\\), changing \\( f(t) \\) to \\( g(t) \\) will result in a different \\( F(s) \\) becoming \\( G(s) \\), which in turn will change \\( X(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the Laplace transform of the response \\( x(t) \\) will indeed change if the step function is replaced by another function without any intervention.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\": \"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **System Description**:\n   - The system is described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + Nf \\).\n   - \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are constant matrices.\n   - \\( f(t) \\) is an external controlled input.\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) is \\( F(s) \\).\n\n2. **Initial Condition**:\n   - Initially, \\( f(t) \\) is a step function.\n   - We solve for \\( x(t) \\) using this initial form of \\( f(t) \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of Response**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\) is denoted as \\( X(s) \\).\n   - For a step function input, the solution \\( x(t) \\) can be found using the Laplace transform method.\n\n4. **Change in Input Function**:\n   - Now, consider replacing the step function with another function \\( g(t) \\) without any further intervention.\n   - The new Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is \\( G(s) \\).\n\n5. **Effect on System Response**:\n   - Since \\( f(t) \\) is replaced by \\( g(t) \\), the differential equation becomes \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = Mx + Ng \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of the new system response \\( x(t) \\) would be \\( X_g(s) \\), where \\( X_g(s) = (sI - M)^{-1}NG(s) \\).\n\n6. **Comparison of Laplace Transforms**:\n   - If \\( g(t) \\) is different from the original step function, then \\( G(s) \\neq F(s) \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( X_g(s) \\neq X(s) \\), meaning the Laplace transform of the response changes.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the Laplace transform of the response \\( x(t) \\) will indeed change if the step function is replaced by another function without any further intervention.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
