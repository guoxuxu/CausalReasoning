    "To address this question, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Understand the Transformation**: The transformation \\( T \\) is defined as \\( T(g)(x) = \\int_0^x g(t) dt \\). This is a common operation known as the indefinite integral or antiderivative of \\( g(x) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( g(x) \\)**: For \\( g(x) = \\sin(x) \\), the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(g)(\\omega) \\) can be calculated using the definition of the Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(g)(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sin(x) e^{-i\\omega x} dx.\n   \\]\n   Using properties of the Fourier transform, specifically that the Fourier transform of \\( \\sin(x) \\) is a pair of impulses at \\( \\pm 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(\\sin(x))(\\omega) = \\frac{i}{2} (\\delta(\\omega - 1) - \\delta(\\omega + 1)),\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of \\( T(g)(x) \\)**: To find the Fourier transform of \\( T(g)(x) \\), we need to consider how the Fourier transform interacts with integration. A key property of the Fourier transform is that it converts differentiation into multiplication by \\( i\\omega \\), and integration (which is the reverse process) corresponds to division by \\( i\\omega \\). Therefore, applying the Fourier transform to \\( T(g)(x) \\) involves:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(T(g))(w) = \\mathcal{F}\\left( \\int_0^x \\sin(t) dt \\right).\n   \\]\n   The integral from 0 to \\( x \\) of \\( \\sin(t) \\) is \\( -\\cos(x) + 1 \\).
