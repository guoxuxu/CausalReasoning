We are then considering the integral over this new contour, \\( I' = \\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\, dz \\).\n\n3. **Holomorphic Function Property**: The function \\( f(z) \\) is given as holomorphic (analytic) within and on the contour \\( C \\). Holomorphic functions have some important properties, including the fact that the integral of such a function over any closed contour in its domain is zero (Cauchy's Integral Theorem).\n\n4. **Change of Variables**: To understand how the integral changes under the transformation, we need to consider a change of variables.

Conformal maps preserve angles but not necessarily lengths or areas. Importantly, they do not change the winding number of a curve around a point. However, the integral over a transformed contour depends on the specific form of the transformation and the function being integrated.\n\n6. **General Case Analysis**: For a general holomorphic function \\( f(z) \\) and a conformal map \\( w(z) \\), the integral over the transformed contour \\( w(C) \\) will generally not be equal to the integral over the original contour \\( C \\). The integral \\( \\int_{w(C)} f(w^{-1}(z)) \\frac{dw}{dz} \\, dz \\) needs to be considered, which accounts for the change in the differential element due to the transformation.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: In general, the integral \\( I' = \\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\, dz \\) does not remain equal to the original integral \\( I = \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) because the transformation \\( w(z) \\) changes the path of integration and thus the value of the integral unless additional conditions are met (such as the specific form of \\( f(z) \\) and \\( w(z) \\) that might simplify the integral).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the value of the integral \\( I' = \\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\, dz \\) remains equal to the original integral \\( I = \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) after applying the transformation \\( w(z) = e^{az} \\), we need to consider the properties of conformal mappings and the effect on integrals.\n\n1. **Transformation of the Contour**: The transformation \\( w(z) = e^{az} \\) maps the contour \\( C \\) to a new contour \\( w(C) \\). For a conformal mapping (which \\( w(z) = e^{az} \\) is, as it is analytic everywhere except at infinity), the length element transforms according to the Jacobian determinant of the transformation.\n\n2. **Jacobian Determinant**: The Jacobian determinant of the transformation \\( w(z) = e^{az} \\) is given by the modulus squared of the derivative of \\( w(z) \\):\n   \\[\n   |w'(z)|^2 = |ae^{az}|^2 = a^2 |e^{az}|^2 = a^2.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( a \\) is a complex constant, \\( |a|^2 \\) is a positive real number.\n\n3. **Change of Variables in the Integral**: When transforming the integral, we need to account for the change in the differential element \\( dz \\) to \\( dw \\). The relationship between \\( dz \\) and \\( dw \\) is:\n   \\[\n   dz = \\frac{dw}{w'(z)} = \\frac{dw}{ae^{az}}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting this into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   I' = \\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\, dz = \\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\frac{dw}{ae^{az}}.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Holomorphic Function \\( f(z) \\)**: Since \\( f(z) \\) is holomorphic, it is independent of the path taken as long as the path is within the domain of holomorphy. However, the factor \\( \\frac{1}{ae^{az}} \\) introduces a dependency on \\( z \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The integral \\( I' \\) includes an additional factor \\( \\frac{1}{ae^{az}} \\), which means that the transformed integral \\( I' \\) is not simply equal to \\( I \\). Therefore, the value of the integral \\( I' \\) does not remain equal to the original integral \\( I \\) unless \\( a = 0 \\), which would make the transformation trivial.\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Original Integral**: The original integral \\( I = \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) is defined over a contour \\( C \\) in the complex plane, where \\( f(z) \\) is a holomorphic (complex differentiable) function.\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation \\( w(z) = e^{az} \\) maps the contour \\( C \\) to a new contour \\( w(C) \\).\n\n3. **New Integral**: The transformed integral \\( I' = \\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\, dz \\) is defined over the new contour \\( w(C) \\).\n\n4. **Holomorphic Function**: Since \\( f(z) \\) is holomorphic, it satisfies Cauchy's integral theorem, which states that the integral of a holomorphic function over any closed contour is zero, provided there are no singularities inside the contour.\n\n5. **Change of Variables**: When we apply the transformation \\( w(z) \\), we need to consider how the differential \\( dz \\) changes. Let \\( z = w^{-1}(w) \\). Then, \\( dz = \\frac{dz}{dw} dw \\).\n\n6. **Integral Transformation**: The integral \\( I' \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   I' = \\int_{w(C)} f(z) \\, dz = \\int_{w(C)} f(w^{-1}(w)) \\frac{dz}{dw} dw\n   \\]\n\n7. **Holomorphicity and Transformation**: For the integral to remain unchanged, the change of variables must preserve the holomorphic property and the area under the curve. However, the exponential transformation \\( w(z) = e^{az} \\) generally distorts the contour \\( C \\) and changes its shape and size, unless \\( a \\) is such that the transformation is conformal (angle-preserving).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: In general, applying the transformation \\( w(z) = e^{az} \\) to the contour \\( C \\) without further modification does not guarantee that the value of the integral remains the same. The transformation can change the length and shape of the contour, affecting the integral value.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
