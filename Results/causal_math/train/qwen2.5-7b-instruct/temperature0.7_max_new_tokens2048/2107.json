This means that the control input \\(u\\) is a linear function of the state \\(z\\) with time-varying coefficients \\(D(t)\\) and \\(E(t)\\).\n\n3. **Modified Transformation**: After time \\(t_1\\), the transformation changes to \\(u(t) = G(t)z + H(t)\\), where \\(G(t)\\) and \\(H(t)\\) are new time-varying matrix functions. \n\n4. **Impact on Dynamics**: The change in the transformation affects how the control input \\(u\\) is determined from the state \\(z\\).
