Taking the Fourier transform of both sides of the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -D k^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   This is because the Fourier transform of the second derivative with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( -k^2 \\) times the Fourier transform.\n\n4. **Solution of Transformed PDE**: The transformed PDE is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time, which has the solution:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-D k^2 t}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{u}(k, 0) \\) is the initial condition, which is the Fourier transform of \\( u(x, 0) \\).\n\n5. **Impact of Changing Parameters**: If the diffusion coefficient \\( D \\) changes at some time \\( t_1 \\), say to \\( D' \\), the PDE changes to \\( \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t} = D' \\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial x^2} \\). The Fourier transform of this new PDE would then be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u'}}{\\partial t} = -D' k^2 \\hat{u'}\n   \\]\n   The solution for this new PDE is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u'}(k, t) = \\hat{u'}(k, 0) e^{-D' k^2 t}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Dependence on Initial Conditions**: The solution \\( \\hat{u'}(k, t) \\) depends on the initial condition \\( \\hat{u'}(k, 0) \\), which is the Fourier transform of the initial condition \\( u'(x, 0) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\). However, the evolution of \\( \\hat{u'}(k, t) \\) after \\( t_1 \\) only depends on the new parameter \\( D' \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: While the initial conditions set by the original parameter \\( D \\) influence the initial state, once the parameter \\( D \\) changes at \\( t_1 \\), the subsequent evolution of \\( \\hat{u}(k, t) \\) solely depends on the new parameter \\( D' \\) without any influence from the original parameter \\( D \\) after \\( t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
