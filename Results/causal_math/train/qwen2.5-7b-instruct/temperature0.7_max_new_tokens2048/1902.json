For simplicity, let's denote the Laplace transform of \\( u(x) \\) as \\( U(s) \\), where \\( s \\) is the transform variable.\n\n3. **Transforming the Differential Equation**: Using the properties of the Laplace transform for derivatives, the transformed equation would involve \\( U(s) \\) and its derivatives with respect to \\( s \\). Specifically, it would look something like:\n   \\[ s^2 U(s) - sp(0)U(s) - p'(0)U(s) - p(0)p'(0)U(s) + p(s) (sU(s) - u(0)) + q(s)U(s) = 0 \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[ (s^2 + p(s)s + q(s))U(s) - sp(0)U(s) - p'(0)U(s) - p(0)p'(0)U(s) + p(s)u(0) = 0 \\]\n\n4. **Recovering \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\)**: To determine \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) from the transformed equation alone, we need to reverse the Laplace transform process. However, the transformed equation involves \\( U(s) \\), which is the Laplace transform of \\( u(x) \\). Without additional information about \\( u(x) \\), \\( p(x) \\), and \\( q(x) \\), it's not possible to uniquely determine these functions from the transformed equation alone.\n\n5. **Initial Conditions**: Even with initial conditions provided, recovering \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) directly from the transformed equation is challenging because the inverse Laplace transform is required, and this typically requires knowing the form of \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) beforehand.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the transformed equation does not provide direct information about \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) without additional context or initial conditions, we cannot determine these functions solely from the transformed equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

The Laplace Transform of the derivatives will involve the initial conditions of \\( u(x) \\) and its first derivative.\n\n3. **Transformed Equation**: After applying the Laplace Transform, the transformed equation will be of the form \\( F(s) \\cdot s^2 + G(s) \\cdot s + H(s) = 0 \\), where \\( F(s) \\), \\( G(s) \\), and \\( H(s) \\) are functions of \\( s \\) that depend on the original \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\).\n\n4. **Inversion of Information**: To determine \\( p(x) \\) and \\( q(x) \\) from the transformed equation alone, we would need to invert the Laplace Transform process.
