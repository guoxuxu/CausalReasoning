    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Function**: The function given is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), which is a complex exponential function. This function describes a sinusoidal oscillation in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Integral Transform**: An integral transform with kernel \\( K(t, s) = e^{-s^2} \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\). This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) K(t, s) dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-s^2} dt\n   \\]\n   However, this integral does not converge because the integral of an unbounded function like \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) over the entire real line does not exist in the usual sense.

For the Fourier transform, the inverse transform is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} Z(s) e^{2\\pi i s t} ds\n   \\]\n   Given \\( Z(s) \\), we can indeed recover \\( z(t) \\) up to a constant factor, provided that \\( Z(s) \\) contains all the necessary information about \\( z(t) \\).\n\n5. **Kernel Information**: The key point here is that the kernel \\( K(t, s) = e^{-s^2} \\) (or its Fourier equivalent) provides a specific way of transforming the function. If we know the exact form of the kernel and the transformed function \\( Z(s) \\), we can use the inverse transform to recover the original function \\( z(t) \\).\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that if we have the transformed function \\( Z(s) \\) and the exact form of the kernel \\( K(t, s) \\), we can indeed reconstruct the original function \\( z(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\), including \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
