  "Problem": "Consider a complex-valued function defined by \\\\( z(t) = e^{iAt}w \\\\), where A is a real constant and w is a complex constant vector.

  "Explanation": "The function \\\\( h(w) \\\\) modifies the initial vector \\\\( w_0 \\\\), influencing the vector's phase and potentially its magnitude depending on B and the initial vector orientation. This alteration changes the starting conditions of the dynamics brought forth by \\\\( e^{iAt} \\\\).
