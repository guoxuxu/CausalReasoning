Given that \\( f(x) = e^{iz} \\) with \\( z = Ax + B \\), we have:\n\\[ T[f(x)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ixt} e^{i(Ax + B)} dx \\]\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Integral\nSimplify the expression inside the integral:\n\\[ T[f(x)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(B - t)x + iB} dx \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ T[f(x)] = e^{iB} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(B - t)x} dx \\]\n\n### Step 3: Evaluating the Integral\nThe integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(B - t)x} dx\\) is a well-known result in Fourier analysis. It converges only if \\( B - t \\neq 0 \\). If \\( B - t \\neq 0 \\), the integral evaluates to \\( 2\\pi \\delta(t - B) \\), where \\(\\delta\\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\nThus, we get:\n\\[ T[f(x)] = 2\\pi e^{iB} \\delta(t - B) \\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Information\nFrom the above result, we see that the Fourier transform \\( T[f(x)] \\) provides us with information about the phase shift \\( B \\) and the frequency \\( B \\) itself. However, it does not provide direct information about the matrix \\( A \\) or any other transformations applied to \\( f(x) \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the given information, we can determine the phase shift \\( B \\) from the Fourier transform \\( T[f(x)] \\), but we cannot determine the matrix \\( A \\) or any other transformations applied to \\( f(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
