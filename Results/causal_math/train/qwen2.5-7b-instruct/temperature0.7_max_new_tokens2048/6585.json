It will generally not follow the same exponential decay pattern as in the constant inductance case.\n\nGiven these points, the current \\( I(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) will not be the same if the inductance had remained constant at \\( L_0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether the current \\( I(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) will be the same when the inductance \\( L(t) \\) changes with time compared to when it remains constant at \\( L_0 \\), we need to analyze the behavior of the circuit in both scenarios.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Circuit with Constant Inductance \\( L_0 \\):**\n   - The differential equation governing the current \\( I(t) \\) in the circuit with constant inductance \\( L_0 \\) and resistance \\( R \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     L_0 \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = \\frac{V_0}{L_0}\n     \\]\n   - This can be solved using standard techniques for first-order linear differential equations. The solution is:\n     \\[\n     I(t) = \\left(\\frac{V_0}{R}\\right)\\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{R}{L_0}t}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Circuit with Time-Varying Inductance \\( L(t) = L_0 e^{kt} \\):**\n   - The differential equation now becomes:\n     \\[\n     L(t) \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = \\frac{V_0}{L(t)}\n     \\]\n     Substituting \\( L(t) = L_0 e^{kt} \\):\n     \\[\n     L_0 e^{kt} \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = \\frac{V_0}{L_0 e^{kt}}\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dI}{dt} + \\frac{R}{L_0 e^{kt}} I = \\frac{V_0}{L_0^2 e^{2kt}}\n     \\]\n   - This is a non-homogeneous first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we use an integrating factor method. The integrating factor \\( \\mu(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\mu(t) = e^{\\int \\frac{R}{L_0 e^{kt}} dt} = e^{\\frac{R}{k} (e^{-kt} - 1)}\n     \\]\n   - Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor and solving, we get:\n     \\[\n     I(t) = \\left(\\frac{V_0}{R}\\right) \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{R}{L_0}(1 - e^{-kt})}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Comparison at Time \\( t = T \\):**\n   - For the constant inductance case:\n     \\[\n     I(T) = \\left(\\frac{V_0}{R}\\right)\\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{RT}{L_0}}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - For the time-varying inductance case:\n     \\[\n     I(T) = \\left(\\frac{V_0}{R}\\right) \\left(1 - e^{-\\frac{R}{L_0}(1 - e^{-kT})}\\right)\n     \\]\n\nSince \\( e^{-\\frac{RT}{L_0}} \\neq e^{-\\frac{R}{L_0}(1 - e^{-kT})} \\) unless \\( k = 0 \\) (which means no change in inductance), the current at time \\( t = T \\) will not be the same in both cases.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe current \\( I(t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) will not be the same if the inductance changes with time compared to when it remains constant.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
