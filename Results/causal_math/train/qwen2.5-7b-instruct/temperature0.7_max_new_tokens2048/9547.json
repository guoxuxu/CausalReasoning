    "To determine if the final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is solely dependent on the initial parameters \\( \\omega, \\gamma, \\beta \\) and not on \\( \\alpha \\) or \\( \\delta \\), we need to analyze the effect of the transformations \\( h(z) \\) and \\( k(z) \\) on the system.\n\n1. **Transformation \\( h(z) = e^{i\\alpha t}z \\)**:\n   - This transformation scales \\( z \\) by a complex exponential factor that depends on \\( \\alpha \\) and time \\( t \\).\n   - It modifies the phase but not the magnitude of \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( k(z) = e^{-i\\delta t}z \\)**:\n   - This transformation also scales \\( z \\) by a complex exponential factor that depends on \\( \\delta \\) and time \\( t \\).\n   - Similar to \\( h(z) \\), it modifies the phase but not the magnitude of \\( z \\).\n\n3. **Differential Equation Analysis**:\n   - The original differential equation is \\( \\ddot{z} = -\\omega^2 z + \\gamma \\sin(\\beta t) \\).\n   - The transformations \\( h(z) \\) and \\( k(z) \\) do not change the form of the differential equation itself but modify the initial conditions or the input.\n\n4. **Effect of Interventions**:\n   - Applying \\( k(z) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) means \\( z(t) \\) is modified by \\( e^{-i\\delta (t-t_1)} \\) for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\).\n   - However, the core dynamics of the system, described by \\( \\ddot{z} = -\\omega^2 z + \\gamma \\sin(\\beta t) \\), remain unchanged in terms of the parameters \\( \\omega, \\gamma, \\beta \\).\n\n5. **Final State Independence**:\n   - The final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will still be influenced by the original differential equation's parameters \\( \\omega, \\gamma, \\beta \\).\n   - The phase shifts introduced by \\( h(z) \\) and \\( k(z) \\) do not alter the underlying dynamics that depend on \\( \\omega, \\gamma, \\beta \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed be solely dependent on the initial parameters \\( \\omega, \\gamma, \\beta \\) and not on \\( \\alpha \\) or \\( \\delta \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the System**: The system is described by the second-order differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\ddot{z} = -\\omega^2 z + \\gamma \\sin(\\beta t)\n   \\]\n   This describes a damped harmonic oscillator with an external driving force.\n\n2. **Transformation Analysis**:\n   - Transformation \\( h(z) = e^{i\\alpha t}z \\): This transformation scales \\( z \\) by a complex exponential factor. It modifies the phase but not the magnitude of \\( z \\).\n   - Transformation \\( k(z) = e^{-i\\delta t}z \\): Similarly, this transformation scales \\( z \\) by a complex exponential factor, modifying its phase but not the magnitude.\n\n3. **Intervention Analysis**:\n   - Applying \\( k(z) = e^{-i\\delta t}z \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) introduces a phase shift to the function \\( z(t) \\). However, it does not change the underlying dynamics described by the differential equation.\n   \n4. **Impact on Final State**:\n   - The final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will be influenced by the initial conditions, the parameters \\( \\omega, \\gamma, \\beta \\), and the external driving force. The transformations \\( h(z) \\) and \\( k(z) \\) only affect the phase of \\( z(t) \\) but do not alter the underlying dynamics or the parameters that govern them.\n   - Since the transformations \\( h(z) \\) and \\( k(z) \\) only modify the phase and not the magnitude or the underlying parameters, they do not change the dependency of the final state \\( z(T) \\) on \\( \\omega, \\gamma, \\beta \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed be solely dependent on the initial parameters \\( \\omega, \\gamma, \\beta \\) and not on \\( \\alpha \\) or \\( \\delta \\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
