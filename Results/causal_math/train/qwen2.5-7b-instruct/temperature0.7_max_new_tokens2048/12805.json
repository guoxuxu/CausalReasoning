    "To determine if we can uniquely determine \\(x(t)\\) from the knowledge of \\(y(t)\\)'s Fourier Transform without knowing \\(\\omega\\) or whether the modulation \\(z(t)\\) was used, let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Modulation**: The output signal \\(y(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = z(t) \\cdot x(t)\n   \\]\n   where \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\(y(t)\\)**: The Fourier Transform of \\(y(t)\\) can be expressed using the properties of the Fourier Transform. Specifically, the Fourier Transform of a product of two functions is related to their convolution in the frequency domain. Thus, the Fourier Transform of \\(y(t)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   Y(f) = Z(f) * X(f)\n   \\]\n   where \\(Z(f)\\) is the Fourier Transform of \\(z(t)\\) and \\(X(f)\\) is the Fourier Transform of \\(x(t)\\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of \\(z(t)\\)**: Since \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\), its Fourier Transform \\(Z(f)\\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\(\\pm \\omega\\):\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = \\delta(f - \\omega) + \\delta(f + \\omega)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convolution in Frequency Domain**: The convolution of \\(Z(f)\\) with \\(X(f)\\) results in shifting \\(X(f)\\) by \\(\\pm \\omega\\):\n   \\[\n   Y(f) = \\delta(f - \\omega) * X(f) + \\delta(f + \\omega) * X(f)\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   Y(f) = X(f - \\omega) + X(f + \\omega)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Recovering \\(X(f)\\)**: Given \\(Y(f)\\), we need to recover \\(X(f)\\). From the equation \\(Y(f) = X(f - \\omega) + X(f + \\omega)\\), it is clear that without knowing \\(\\omega\\), we cannot uniquely determine \\(X(f)\\). There are infinitely many possible functions \\(X(f)\\) that could satisfy this relationship for any given \\(\\omega\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since we do not have enough information to determine \\(\\omega\\), we cannot uniquely determine \\(X(f)\\) from \\(Y(f)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
