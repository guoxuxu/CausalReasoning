The general solution for \\( x(t) \\) depends on the roots of the characteristic equation:\n   - If the roots are real and distinct, the solution is a sum of two exponential functions.\n   - If the roots are complex (which occurs when the discriminant \\( c^2 - 4mk < 0 \\)), the solution involves sines and cosines.\n   - If the roots are repeated, the solution includes an additional term with \\( t \\).\n\n5.
