    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We have \\( g(z) = \\int_{\\Gamma} e^{zt} dt \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex variable and \\( \\Gamma \\) is a contour in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation given is \\( h(z) = iz \\). This means that for any complex number \\( z_0 \\), applying \\( h \\) results in \\( h(z_0) = iz_0 \\).\n\n3. **Question**: We need to determine if \\( g(h(z_0)) \\) is equivalent to \\( g(z_0) \\).\n\n4. **Substitution**:\n   - First, compute \\( g(h(z_0)) \\):\n     \\[\n     g(h(z_0)) = g(iz_0) = \\int_{\\Gamma} e^{(iz_0)t} dt\n     \\]\n   - Next, compute \\( g(z_0) \\):\n     \\[\n     g(z_0) = \\int_{\\Gamma} e^{z_0t} dt\n     \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - The integrand in \\( g(h(z_0)) \\) is \\( e^{(iz_0)t} \\).\n   - The integrand in \\( g(z_0) \\) is \\( e^{z_0t} \\).\n\n6. **Complex Exponential Property**:\n   - Recall that \\( e^{(iz_0)t} = e^{i(z_0t)} \\).\n   - Using Euler's formula, \\( e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta) \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     e^{i(z_0t)} = \\cos(z_0t) + i\\sin(z_0t)\n     \\]\n   - On the other hand, \\( e^{z_0t} \\) does not simplify in the same manner unless \\( z_0 \\) is purely imaginary.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Generally, \\( e^{i(z_0t)} \\neq e^{z_0t} \\) unless \\( z_0 \\) is purely imaginary.\n   - Therefore, the integrands are different, leading to different outcomes for the integrals over the same contour \\( \\Gamma \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the outcome of \\( g(z) \\) at \\( z = h(z_0) \\) will not be equivalent to \\( g(z_0) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
