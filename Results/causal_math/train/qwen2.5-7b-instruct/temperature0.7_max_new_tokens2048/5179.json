Applying \\( D \\) to \\( z(t) \\) means taking the \\( n \\)-th derivative of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Operator \\( E \\)**: The operator \\( E \\) is defined as \\( Ez = \\frac{d^m}{dt^m}z \\), where \\( m = 3 \\). So, \\( E \\) specifically takes the third derivative of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n4. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the operator \\( E \\) is applied to the function \\( z(t) \\). This means we compute \\( Ez(t_1) = \\frac{d^3}{dt^3}e^{it} \\).\n\n5. **Effect of \\( E \\)**: The third derivative of \\( e^{it} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^3}{dt^3}e^{it} = i^3 e^{it} = -i e^{it}\n   \\]\n   This result shows that applying \\( E \\) changes the function from \\( e^{it} \\) to \\( -i e^{it} \\) at the specific point \\( t_1 \\).\n\n6. **Function Behavior Post-Intervention**: For \\( T > t_1 \\), the function behavior is determined by the new form after the intervention. Since the intervention only affects the function at \\( t_1 \\) and does not change the general form of the function for all subsequent times (as the third derivative operation is local and does not propagate backward in time), the function \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will still follow the general form \\( e^{it} \\) unless another intervention occurs.\n\n7. **Dependency on \\( D \\) and \\( E \\)**: The functions \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) are operators that can change the function locally. However, once the function has been transformed by these operators at a specific time, the effect of these transformations is localized to that point in time. For \\( T > t_1 \\), the function returns to its original form \\( e^{it} \\) because no further interventions are mentioned.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the function \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed be solely dependent on \\( t \\) and not on the actions of \\( D \\) or \\( E \\) after the initial intervention at \\( t_1 \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
