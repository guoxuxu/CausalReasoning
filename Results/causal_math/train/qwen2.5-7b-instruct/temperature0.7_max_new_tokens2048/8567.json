    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation \\( g(z) = z^n \\) is applied to the function \\( f(z) \\). This means that the new function within the integral becomes \\( f(g(z)) = f(z^n) \\).\n\n2. **Complex Integration and Poles**: When integrating a function around a closed contour in the complex plane, poles (points where the function goes to infinity) play a crucial role. If a pole is introduced due to the transformation or the original function, it will affect the value of the integral.\n\n3. **Effect of the Transformation on Poles**: If there is a pole at \\( z_0 \\) for the function \\( f(z) \\), after applying the transformation \\( g(z) = z^n \\), the new function \\( f(z^n) \\) will have a pole at \\( z = z_0^{1/n} \\).

Introducing a pole changes these residues, which in turn affects the value of the integral.\n\n5. **Scaling Factor**: However, the statement \"solely affects the integral by the power \\( n \\)\" needs clarification.

The integral's value can be influenced by multiple factors including the residues at the poles and the path of integration.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Complex Integration and Transformation**:\n   - We start with a complex function \\( f(z) \\) integrated along a contour in the complex plane.\n   - A transformation \\( g(z) = z^n \\) is applied to \\( f(z) \\), resulting in a new function \\( f(g(z)) = f(z^n) \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Transformation on the Integral**:\n   - The integral becomes \\( \\oint_C f(z^n) dz \\).\n   - This transformation can change the nature of the integrand, but it doesn't necessarily change the value of the integral by a simple factor of \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Introducing a Pole**:\n   - Introducing a pole into the function \\( f(z^n) \\) means that \\( f(z^n) \\) has a singularity at some point.\n   - The presence of a pole can significantly affect the value of the integral, especially if the contour passes near or around the pole.\n\n4. **Residue Theorem**:\n   - If the contour encloses a pole, the residue theorem can be used to evaluate the integral.\n   - The residue theorem states that the integral equals \\( 2\\pi i \\) times the sum of residues of the poles enclosed by the contour.\n   - The residue of \\( f(z^n) \\) at a pole will generally depend on the specific form of \\( f(z) \\) and the location of the pole.\n\n5. **Scaling Factor Consideration**:\n   - While the transformation \\( g(z) = z^n \\) might suggest a scaling effect, the actual impact on the integral depends on the specific behavior of \\( f(z) \\) and the location of the poles.\n   - Simply applying \\( z^n \\) does not guarantee that the integral will scale by \\( n \\); other factors come into play, such as the nature of the poles and their residues.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The introduction of a pole and the application of \\( z^n \\) do not solely affect the integral by the power \\( n \\). The exact effect depends on the detailed properties of the functions involved.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Complex Integration and Transformation**: We start with a complex function \\( f(z) \\) integrated over a contour \\( C \\) in the complex plane. The integral is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\oint_C f(z) \\, dz\n   \\]\n2. **Transformation Application**: A specific transformation \\( g(z) = z^n \\) (where \\( n \\) is a non-zero integer) is applied to \\( f(z) \\). This transforms the function to \\( f(g(z)) = f(z^n) \\).\n\n3. **Introduction of a Pole**: Introducing a pole into the function means that there is a singularity in \\( f(z^n) \\) at some point. The nature of the pole (order of the pole) will determine how it affects the integral.\n\n4. **Effect on the Integral**: The presence of a pole at \\( z = a \\) in \\( f(z^n) \\) will affect the residue of the function at that point. If the original function \\( f(z) \\) had a simple pole at \\( w \\), after applying the transformation \\( g(z) \\), the new function \\( f(z^n) \\) will have a pole at \\( z = w^{1/n} \\). The order of this pole will be \\( n \\) times the order of the original pole.\n\n5. **Residue Theorem**: According to the residue theorem, the value of the integral around a closed contour depends on the residues of the poles enclosed by the contour. If the pole order increases from 1 to \\( n \\), the residue contribution to the integral will change accordingly.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The effect of introducing a pole after transforming the function \\( f(z) \\) by \\( g(z) = z^n \\) is not simply a multiplication by \\( n \\). The integral is affected by the residue contributions from the poles, which depend on the order of the poles introduced by the transformation.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer to the question \"Does this solely affect the integral by the power \\( n \\)?\" is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation given is \\( g(z) = z^n \\), where \\( n \\) is a non-zero integer. This means we are raising \\( z \\) to the power of \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Complex Integration and Poles**: When integrating a function \\( f(z) \\) around a contour that includes poles, the value of the integral can be affected by the nature and location of these poles.\n\n3. **Effect of Transformation on Integral**: If \\( g(z) = z^n \\) is applied to \\( f(z) \\), the new function becomes \\( f(g(z)) = f(z^n) \\). The poles of \\( f(z) \\) will transform under this mapping. If \\( f(z) \\) has a pole at \\( z_0 \\), then \\( f(z^n) \\) will have a pole at \\( z = z_0^{1/n} \\).\n\n4. **Counting Poles**: The number of poles introduced by the transformation depends on \\( n \\). For example, if \\( n = 2 \\), each original pole will split into two poles due to the square root, and similarly for other values of \\( n \\).\n\n5. **Integral Value Change**: The value of the integral can change based on the residue theorem. The residues at the poles will change depending on how many times the original pole maps to the same point after the transformation. However, the overall effect of the transformation on the integral is not simply a multiplication by \\( n \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The introduction of a pole and the application of the transformation \\( g(z) = z^n \\) do not solely affect the integral by the power \\( n \\). The integral's value can change more complexly due to the transformation of the poles and their residues.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. Understanding the given information:\n   - We have a complex integral along a contour.\n   - The function \\( f(z) \\) is transformed by \\( g(z) = z^n \\), where \\( n \\) is a non-zero integer.\n   - A pole is introduced.\n\n2. Considering the effect of the transformation:\n   - The transformation \\( g(z) = z^n \\) scales the function \\( f(z) \\) by \\( z^n \\).\n   - This means that wherever \\( f(z) \\) appears in the integral, it now appears as \\( f(z)z^n \\).\n\n3. Analyzing the introduction of a pole:\n   - Introducing a pole changes the behavior of the function at that point.\n   - However, the presence of a pole doesn't directly change the integral by a factor of \\( n \\); it affects the residue calculation at that point.\n\n4. Evaluating the impact on the integral:\n   - The integral of \\( f(z)z^n \\) around a contour will generally be affected by the value of \\( n \\).\n   - Specifically, if there's a pole at some point, the residue theorem tells us that the integral will involve the residue of \\( f(z)z^n \\) at that pole.\n   - The residue of \\( f(z)z^n \\) at a simple pole \\( z_0 \\) would typically be proportional to \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) times the residue of \\( f(z) \\) at \\( z_0 \\).\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - While the presence of a pole can affect the integral, saying that it \"solely affects the integral by the power \\( n \\)\" is not entirely accurate.\n   - The effect is more nuanced, involving both the transformation by \\( z^n \\) and the residue at the pole.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
