This means that the state at any time \\( t \\) is determined solely by the initial state \\( z_0 \\) and the matrix \\( A \\).\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( C \\)**: At some point in time, say \\( t_1 \\), the state \\( z(t_1) \\) undergoes a transformation due to the matrix \\( C \\). This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(t_1^+) = Cz(t_1)\n   \\]\n   where \\( z(t_1^+) \\) represents the state just after the transformation by \\( C \\).\n\n3. **Transformation by \\( D \\)**: An additional transformation by the matrix \\( D \\) occurs at \\( t_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t_1^+) = Dz(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Since both \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) act at the same time \\( t_1 \\), we need to consider their combined effect. For simplicity, let's assume they are applied sequentially, i.e., first by \\( C \\) and then by \\( D \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t_1^+) = DCz(t_1)\n   \\]\n\n4. **State After Intervention**: After the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the state continues to evolve according to the matrix \\( A \\) from \\( t_1 \\) onwards:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{(T-t_1)A}z(t_1^+)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( z(t_1^+) = DCz(t_1) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{(T-t_1)A}DCz(t_1)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**: To determine if \\( z(T) \\) depends solely on \\( A \\) and not on \\( C \\) or \\( D \\), we need to examine the expression for \\( z(T) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{(T-t_1)A}DCz(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Clearly, the term \\( DCz(t_1) \\) involves both matrices \\( C \\) and \\( D \\). Therefore, the final state \\( z(T) \\) does depend on both \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) through the intermediate state \\( z(t_1^+) \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
