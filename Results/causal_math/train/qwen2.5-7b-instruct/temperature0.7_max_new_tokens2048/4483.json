It transforms into a Gaussian function in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the input function \\( g(t) \\) is switched to \\( h(t) = e^{-ct^2} \\). This means that for \\( t < t_1 \\), the system is driven by \\( g(t) \\), and for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), it is driven by \\( h(t) \\).\n\n4. **Final System Behavior at Time \\( T \\)**: To determine if the final system's behavior at time \\( T \\) is independent of the original input \\( g(t) \\), we need to consider the response of the system after the switch at \\( t_1 \\).\n\n5. **Response Analysis**:\n   - The system's response to \\( g(t) \\) before \\( t_1 \\) and to \\( h(t) \\) after \\( t_1 \\) will depend on the constants \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) respectively.\n   - Since \\( a \\neq c \\) (as they are different constants), the responses to \\( g(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) will be different.\n   - However, the system's state at \\( t_1 \\) will carry over to \\( t > t_1 \\), meaning the transition from \\( g(t) \\) to \\( h(t) \\) will not abruptly change the system's behavior without considering the continuous influence of the initial condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The final behavior at time \\( T \\) will depend on both the initial input \\( g(t) \\) and the subsequent input \\( h(t) \\), as well as the continuous evolution of the system state across the transition point \\( t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final system's behavior at time \\( T \\) is not independent of the original input \\( g(t) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To address this question, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System Behavior**:\n   - The system is described by the differential equation \\(\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = g(t)\\).\n   - Initially, the input function is \\(g(t) = e^{-at^2}\\).\n   - At time \\(t_1\\), the input function is switched to \\(h(t) = e^{-ct^2}\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Effects**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\(g(t) = e^{-at^2}\\) is a Gaussian function in the frequency domain.\n   - Similarly, the Fourier transform of \\(h(t) = e^{-ct^2}\\) is also a Gaussian function in the frequency domain.\n   - The Fourier transform does not change the nature of the functions but transforms them from the time domain to the frequency domain, which can simplify certain analyses but doesn't inherently change their properties in terms of how they affect the system.\n\n3. **Impact on System Behavior**:\n   - When \\(g(t) = e^{-at^2}\\) is applied, the system response \\(x(t)\\) will be influenced by this input.\n   - When \\(h(t) = e^{-ct^2}\\) is applied after time \\(t_1\\), the system response \\(x(t)\\) will change based on this new input.\n   - The system's behavior at any given time \\(T\\) will depend on both the initial input and the subsequent inputs.\n\n4. **Independence of Final Behavior at Time \\(T\\)**:\n   - The final system behavior at time \\(T\\) will be a combination of the responses to both \\(g(t)\\) and \\(h(t)\\).\n   - Since the inputs are different and the system's response is linear (assuming no non-linear elements), the final behavior at \\(T\\) cannot be independent of the original input \\(g(t)\\). The response to \\(g(t)\\) will still influence the system even after the switch to \\(h(t)\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the final system's behavior at time \\(T\\) will not be independent of the original input \\(g(t)\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
