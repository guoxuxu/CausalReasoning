    "To analyze whether the frequency spectrum of the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) at time \\( t = T \\) depends solely on the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) after applying the intervention \\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\) at \\( t = T/2 \\), let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) will give us its frequency spectrum.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of Initial Function**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function and \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the frequency of the exponential function.\n   - This indicates that the initial frequency spectrum has a single peak at \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\).\n\n3. **Intervention Application**: At \\( t = T/2 \\), an intervention \\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\) is applied. This intervention modifies the function \\( z(t) \\) in the time domain.\n\n4. **Effect of Intervention on Frequency Spectrum**:\n   - The intervention \\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\) can be seen as a phase shift and scaling of the function \\( z(t) \\).\n   - Specifically, \\( h(t) \\cdot z(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} = 1 \\) for all \\( t \\), which means the function remains unchanged after the intervention.\n\n5. **Frequency Spectrum After Intervention**:\n   - Since the function \\( z(t) \\) remains unchanged after the intervention, the frequency spectrum should also remain unchanged.\n   - Therefore, the frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\) will still have a single peak at \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\).\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that the frequency spectrum of the function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) does indeed depend solely on the original frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step.\n\n1. **Original Function**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a complex exponential with a constant frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\Omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i(\\Omega - \\omega)t} dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral is a Dirac delta function:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\Omega - \\omega)\n     \\]\n   - This indicates that the frequency spectrum of \\( z(t) \\) is a single impulse at \\( \\Omega = \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Intervention**: At time \\( t = T/2 \\), the function \\( h(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\) is applied. However, since \\( h(t) \\) is not directly involved in the original function \\( z(t) \\) but rather influences the system at \\( t = T/2 \\), we need to consider how this intervention affects the function \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Intervention**:\n   - If \\( h(t) \\) is applied at \\( t = T/2 \\), it does not directly change the form of \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t < T/2 \\). However, it might affect \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t > T/2 \\).\n   - Specifically, if \\( h(t) \\) is applied at \\( t = T/2 \\), it could introduce a phase shift or modify the amplitude of \\( z(t) \\) after \\( T/2 \\).\n\n5. **Frequency Spectrum at \\( t = T \\)**:\n   - To determine the frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\), we need to consider the entire behavior of \\( z(t) \\) from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\).\n   - Since \\( h(t) \\) is applied at \\( t = T/2 \\), it will affect the phase of \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t > T/2 \\). Therefore, the frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\) will no longer be purely a single impulse at \\( \\omega \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The presence of the intervention \\( h(t) \\) at \\( t = T/2 \\) introduces additional complexity to the function \\( z(t) \\) and changes its phase for \\( t > T/2 \\).\n   - Consequently, the frequency spectrum at \\( t = T \\) will not depend solely on the original frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
