This term remains constant after \\(t_1\\).\n\n5. **Final Analysis**:\n   - The transformation \\(g(z)\\) scales and shifts the original function \\(z(t) = e^{it}\\).\n   - The intervention \\(h(z)\\) adds a constant term \\(e^{it_1}\\) at \\(t = t_1\\).\n\nGiven these points, the endpoint \\(z(T)\\) will be influenced by both the scaling and shifting due to \\(g(z)\\) and the addition of \\(e^{it_1}\\) due to \\(h(z)\\). Therefore, the endpoint \\(z(T)\\) cannot depend solely on the original \\(e^{it}\\) without considering the effects of \\(g(z)\\) and \\(h(z)\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Original Function**: \\(z(t) = e^{it}\\)\n\n2. **Transformation \\(g(z)\\)**:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_0^t e^{is} ds \\cdot z\n   \\]\n   First, we compute the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^t e^{is} ds = \\left[ \\frac{e^{is}}{i} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\left( \\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i} \\right) \\cdot z\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention \\(h(z)\\)**:\n   \\[\n   h(z) = z + e^{it_1}\n   \\]\n   This function adds \\(e^{it_1}\\) to the value of \\(z\\).\n\n4. **Impact of \\(g(z)\\) and \\(h(z)\\)**:\n   - The transformation \\(g(z)\\) modifies \\(z\\) based on its history up to time \\(t\\).\n   - The intervention \\(h(z)\\) adds a constant term \\(e^{it_1}\\) to \\(z\\).\n\n5. **Endpoint \\(z(T)\\)**:\n   - The endpoint \\(z(T)\\) depends on the initial condition \\(z(0)\\), the transformations applied over time, and the interventions.\n   - Specifically, for \\(z(t) = e^{it}\\), the endpoint \\(z(T)\\) would be \\(e^{iT}\\) without any transformations or interventions.\n   - The transformation \\(g(z)\\) would modify \\(z(t)\\) based on the integral term, but it does not directly introduce the constant \\(e^{it_1}\\).\n   - The intervention \\(h(z)\\) introduces \\(e^{it_1}\\) to the system, which is not part of the original function \\(e^{it}\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The endpoint \\(z(T)\\) will depend on the original function \\(e^{it}\\), the transformation \\(g(z)\\), and the intervention \\(h(z)\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(z(T)\\) cannot depend solely on the original \\(e^{it}\\) and not on the transformations or interventions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
