    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Integral**: The original function is \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\). The integral of \\( f(z) \\) over a closed contour \\( C \\) in the complex plane is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\int_C f(z) \\, dz = \\int_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz\n   \\]\n   This integral can be evaluated using the Cauchy integral formula, which states that for a simple closed curve \\( C \\) and a point \\( a \\) inside \\( C \\):\n   \\[\n   \\int_C \\frac{1}{z-a} \\, dz = 2\\pi i\n   \\]\n   However, if \\( C \\) encloses the origin (where \\( f(z) \\) has a singularity), the integral is \\( 2\\pi i \\).\n\n2. **Intervention and New Function**: If we intervene by adding a constant complex number \\( k \\) to \\( f(z) \\), the new function becomes \\( f(z) + k \\). The integral of this new function over the same contour \\( C \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\int_C (f(z) + k) \\, dz = \\int_C \\left(\\frac{1}{z} + k\\right) \\, dz = \\int_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz + \\int_C k \\, dz\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluating the Integrals**:\n   - The first term, \\( \\int_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz \\), depends on the original function \\( f(z) \\) and is determined by the properties of the contour \\( C \\).\n   - The second term, \\( \\int_C k \\, dz \\), where \\( k \\) is a constant, can be simplified as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\int_C k \\, dz = k \\int_C dz = k \\cdot 0 = 0\n     \\]\n     because integrating a constant over a closed contour results in zero due to the fundamental theorem of calculus in the context of complex analysis.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the integral of the new function \\( f(z) + k \\) over the contour \\( C \\) simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\int_C (f(z) + k) \\, dz = \\int_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz + 0 = \\int_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz\n   \\]\n   This means the effect on the integral value does not depend on the constant \\( k \\); it only depends on the original function \\( f(z) \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"} because the effect on the integral value does not depend only on the original function \\( f(z) \\); it also depends on the constant \\( k \\) added to \\( f(z) \\).",
    "To determine whether the effect on the integral value depends only on the original function \\( f(z) \\) when \\( f(z) \\) is altered to \\( f(z) + k \\), let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. **Original Integral**: The original integral is given by\n   \\[\n   \\int_C f(z) \\, dz.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Altered Function and Integral**: When \\( f(z) \\) is altered to \\( f(z) + k \\), the new integral becomes\n   \\[\n   \\int_C (f(z) + k) \\, dz.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Linearity of Integration**: The integral of a sum is the sum of integrals, and constants can be factored out of integrals. Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\int_C (f(z) + k) \\, dz = \\int_C f(z) \\, dz + \\int_C k \\, dz.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Integral of a Constant**: The integral of a constant \\( k \\) over a contour \\( C \\) is simply \\( k \\) times the length of the contour \\( C \\). However, since \\( C \\) is a closed contour in the complex plane, the integral of a constant over a closed contour is zero:\n   \\[\n   \\int_C k \\, dz = k \\cdot 0 = 0.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Result**: Thus, the integral simplifies to\n   \\[\n   \\int_C (f(z) + k) \\, dz = \\int_C f(z) \\, dz + 0 = \\int_C f(z) \\, dz.\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the effect on the integral value does not depend on the constant \\( k \\); it remains unchanged.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
