    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The original function is \\( z = w^2 \\), where both \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) are complex variables.

However, the properties of \\( w \\) (such as its real and imaginary parts) do influence the form of the integrand and thus the outcome of the Fourier transform.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{w^2\\}(\\omega)\\) is calculated using the function \\( w^2 \\), it is not solely dependent on the properties of \\( w \\) in the sense that it incorporates the integral over all values of \\( w \\). The result is influenced by the entire function \\( w^2 \\) across its domain.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the Fourier transform of \\( z = w^2 \\) does indeed depend on the properties of \\( w \\), but it's more accurate to say it depends on the specific form of the function \\( w^2 \\) rather than just the properties of \\( w \\) in isolation.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
