If we know \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\) for some \\( s \\), we can directly infer \\( \\omega \\) because the form of the Laplace transform is specific to the value of \\( \\omega \\).\n- The Laplace transform is a linear integral operator that maps a function of time into a function of a complex variable \\( s \\). For the given function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\) is unique and directly dependent on \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, if we have the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) \\) at a later time \\( T \\), we can reverse-engineer it to find \\( \\omega \\) because the relationship is one-to-one and well-defined.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
