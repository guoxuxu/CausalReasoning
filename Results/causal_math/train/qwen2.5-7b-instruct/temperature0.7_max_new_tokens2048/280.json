    "To reason through this problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the transformations**:\n   - The original acceleration \\(a\\) is related to force \\(F\\) and mass \\(m\\) by \\(F = ma\\).\n   - A new transformation \\(h(a) = k \\cdot a\\) modifies the acceleration.\n   - Changing the mass to \\(m'\\) would change the relationship to \\(F = m'a'\\), where \\(a'\\) is the new acceleration.\n\n2. **Effect on final position**:\n   - The final position \\(x(T)\\) of an object under constant acceleration can be found using the kinematic equation \\(x(T) = \\frac{1}{2}at^2 + v_0t + x_0\\), assuming zero initial velocity and initial position at zero.\n   - If we apply the transformation \\(h(a) = k \\cdot a\\), the new acceleration becomes \\(ka\\), and the position will be \\(x(T) = \\frac{1}{2}(ka)t^2 = \\frac{k}{2}at^2\\).\n   - If we change the mass to \\(m'\\), the acceleration becomes \\(a' = \\frac{F}{m'}\\).
