    "To determine if a scaling operation at time \\( t_1 \\) can be detected from the transformation \\( g(z) \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Function \\( g(z) \\):**\n   The function \\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{st} z(t) dt \\) represents a Laplace transform of the function \\( z(t) \\). It integrates the product of the exponential decay factor \\( e^{st} \\) and the function \\( z(t) \\) over all time from 0 to infinity.\n\n2. **Effect of Scaling at Time \\( t_1 \\):**\n   If a scaling operation is applied to \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), it means that for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the function becomes \\( z(t) = c \\cdot z(t) \\) for some constant \\( c \\). This implies that the function changes abruptly at \\( t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Impact on the Laplace Transform \\( g(z) \\):**\n   The Laplace transform of a scaled version of \\( z(t) \\) will reflect the change in the function at \\( t_1 \\). Specifically, the Laplace transform of a step function (which is what the scaling operation at \\( t_1 \\) effectively creates) will introduce a discontinuity in the transformed function \\( g(z) \\).\n\n4. **Detecting the Scaling Operation:**\n   To detect a scaling operation at \\( t_1 \\) from \\( g(z) \\), we need to check if there is a sudden change or discontinuity in \\( g(z) \\) around \\( t_1 \\). Since the Laplace transform of a function with a step change will have a corresponding jump in its transform, we can infer the presence of such a step change in \\( z(t) \\) by analyzing \\( g(z) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Yes, we can determine whether a scaling was applied at time \\( t_1 \\) just by observing \\( g(z) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\). The presence of a discontinuity or significant change in the slope of \\( g(z) \\) around \\( t_1 \\) would indicate a scaling operation at that point.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
