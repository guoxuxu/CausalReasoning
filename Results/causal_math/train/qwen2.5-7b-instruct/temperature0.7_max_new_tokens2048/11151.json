    "To reason through this problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State and Dynamics**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).

Using the state just before the intervention, which is \\( z(t_1) = z(0)e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)t_1} \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   k(z(t_1)) = e^{\\beta t_1}z(0)e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)t_1} = z(0)e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega + \\beta)t_1}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evolution After Intervention**: After the intervention, the state continues to evolve according to the original differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\). Therefore, the state at time \\( T > t_1 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z(0)e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega + \\beta)(T - t_1)}e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)t_1} = z(0)e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega + \\beta)(T - t_1) + (\\alpha + i\\omega)t_1}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the exponent:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z(0)e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)T}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final State Analysis**: From the expression \\( z(T) = z(0)e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)T} \\), it is clear that the final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\alpha \\).
