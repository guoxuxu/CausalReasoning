However, applying \\( f(z) \\) does not necessarily preserve the magnitude of \\( z_0 \\). The term \\( z_0^2 \\) will also lie on the unit circle (since \\( |z_0^2| = |z_0|^2 = 1 \\)), but the addition of \\( cz_0 \\) can change the magnitude.\n\n3. **Effect of \\( c \\)**: The term \\( cz_0 \\) scales and rotates \\( z_0 \\) based on the value of \\( c \\). If \\( c \\) is such that \\( |c| \\neq 0 \\), then \\( f(z_0) \\) will generally not lie on the unit circle because the sum of two vectors (both of which could be on the unit circle) is not guaranteed to be on the unit circle unless they are perfectly aligned.\n\n4. **Evolution Under \\( g(z) \\)**: The transformation \\( g(z) = e^{it}z \\) represents a rotation of \\( z \\) around the origin by an angle \\( t \\).
