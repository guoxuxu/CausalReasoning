    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The given transformation is \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\). This means we are multiplying the Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\).\n\n2. **Implication of the Transformation**: Multiplying \\( Z(s) \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) shifts the poles of \\( Z(s) \\) by adding \\( a \\) to them. In the time domain, this corresponds to a time-shifted version of the original signal \\( x(t) \\).\n\n3. **Time-Shift Property of Laplace Transform**: The time-shift property states that if \\( X(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\), then the Laplace transform of \\( x(t-t_0)u(t-t_0) \\) (where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function) is \\( e^{-st_0}X(s) \\). Here, \\( t_0 \\) is the time shift.\n\n4. **Applying the Time-Shift**: In our case, the effect of \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) is similar to shifting the signal by \\( a \\) in the time domain. However, since \\( a \\) is a complex number, it does not directly correspond to a simple time shift but rather a more complex transformation involving both phase and amplitude changes.\n\n5. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: When we apply the inverse Laplace transform to \\( f(z) \\), we do not get back the original signal \\( x(t) \\) but a modified version due to the shift introduced by \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the application of \\( f(z) \\) introduces a modification to the signal in the time domain, the reconstructed signal \\( x(t) \\) after inverse transformation will not be the same as the original \\( x(t) \\) obtained from directly inverse transforming \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformations**:\n   - We start with a time-domain signal \\( x(t) \\), which has a Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\).\n   - The function \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\) is applied to \\( Z(s) \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Transformation**:\n   - The new transform after applying \\( f(z) \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\).\n   - This can be interpreted as a multiplication in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - To find the effect on the time-domain signal, we need to apply the inverse Laplace transform.\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) is \\( e^{at}u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function.\n   - Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\) is \\( e^{at} * x(t) \\), where \\( * \\) denotes convolution.\n\n4. **Effect on the Signal**:\n   - Convolution with \\( e^{at}u(t) \\) modifies the original signal \\( x(t) \\) by multiplying it with \\( e^{at} \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n   - This means the signal \\( x(t) \\) is scaled by \\( e^{at} \\) starting from \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Comparison with Original Signal**:\n   - If we directly inverse transform \\( Z(s) \\) without applying \\( f(z) \\), we get \\( x(t) \\) directly.\n   - Applying \\( f(z) \\) changes the signal to \\( e^{at} * x(t) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The reconstructed signal \\( x(t) \\) after applying \\( f(z) \\) and then inverse transforming is not the same as the original \\( x(t) \\) obtained by simply inverse transforming \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a time-dependent signal \\( x(t) \\) with its Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: The function \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\) is applied to \\( Z(s) \\), resulting in a new function \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Transformation**: If we apply the inverse Laplace transform to \\( F(s) \\), we get a new signal \\( y(t) \\). This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s-a}Z(s)\\right\\}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Time Shift Property of Laplace Transform**: The term \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) in the Laplace domain corresponds to a time shift in the time domain.
