This can be represented as \\( y(t) = u(t - \\delta) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function.\n\n2. **Effect of Transformation \\( g(t) \\)**: We introduce a transformation \\( g(t) = t^2 \\cdot y(t) \\). This means that we multiply the original response \\( y(t) \\) by \\( t^2 \\) before applying the Laplace transform.\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of \\( g(t) \\)**: We need to determine if the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) will still reflect the characteristics of the original shifted step function without any distortions. The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2 \\cdot y(t)\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Laplace transform, specifically the frequency differentiation property and the time-shifting property, we know that:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2 \\cdot y(t)\\} = \\frac{d^2}{ds^2} \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( y(t) = u(t - \\delta) \\), its Laplace transform is:\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{e^{-\\delta s}}{s}\n   \\]\n   Applying the second derivative with respect to \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\frac{d^2}{ds^2} \\left( \\frac{e^{-\\delta s}}{s} \\right)\n   \\]\n   This results in a transformed function that includes higher-order derivatives and exponential terms, which will not simply reflect the original shifted step function without distortions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The transformation \\( g(t) = t^2 \\cdot y(t) \\) introduces a significant change to the form of the Laplace transform. Therefore, the resulting \\( Y(s) \\) after applying \\( g(t) \\) will not reflect the characteristics of the original shifted step function without any distortions.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
