    "To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Understand the PDE**: The given PDE is \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u\\). This is a simple first-order linear PDE that describes exponential decay over time with a rate parameter \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n2. **Initial Condition**: Let's assume \\(u(x, 0)\\) is some arbitrary function of \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Solution Without Fourier Transform**:\n   - The general solution to the PDE can be found using separation of variables or recognizing it as a standard form.\n   - The solution is \\(u(x, t) = u(x, 0)e^{-\\lambda t}\\).\n   - This means that for any initial condition \\(u(x, 0)\\), the function decays exponentially over time.\n\n4. **Applying Fourier Transform**:\n   - Apply the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to the initial condition \\(u(x, 0)\\): \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) = \\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)]\\).\n   - The transformed PDE becomes \\(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda \\hat{u}\\) because the Fourier transform of a derivative is proportional to the frequency variable times the transformed function.\n\n5. **Solving the Transformed PDE**:\n   - The solution to the transformed PDE is \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, t) = \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0)e^{-\\lambda t}\\).\n   - This implies that the Fourier transform of the solution at time \\(t\\) is \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, t) = \\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)]e^{-\\lambda t}\\).\n\n6. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:\n   - To get back to the spatial domain, we apply the inverse Fourier transform to \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, t)\\):\n     \\[\n     u(x, t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(\\xi, t)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)]e^{-\\lambda t}]\n     \\]\n   - By the properties of the Fourier transform, \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}[f(x)]g(t)] = f(x) * g(t)\\), where \\(g(t) = e^{-\\lambda t}\\) is a convolution in the spatial domain.\n   - However, for the specific case of the Fourier transform, the inverse transform simplifies directly due to linearity and the fact that the Fourier transform of a product in one domain is a convolution in the other, but here we are dealing with a simple multiplication in the frequency domain which translates to a direct multiplication in the spatial domain.\n   - Therefore, \\(u(x, t) = u(x, 0)e^{-\\lambda t}\\).\n\n7. **Comparison**:\n   - Both methods (direct evolution and Fourier transform followed by evolution) lead to the same solution \\(u(x, t) = u(x, 0)e^{-\\lambda t}\\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the solution obtained by applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and then evolving it, is indeed the same as directly evolving the initial condition under the given PDE.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
