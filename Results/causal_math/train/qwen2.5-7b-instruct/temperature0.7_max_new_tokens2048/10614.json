Without knowing \\( s \\), it is not possible to uniquely recover \\( z(t) \\) because different values of \\( s \\) could yield the same \\( F(z) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the transformation \\( F(z) \\) depends on \\( s \\), and we do not know \\( s \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) for all \\( t \\) just from \\( F(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether we can uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) for all \\( t \\) from the given transform output \\( F(z) \\) up to time \\( T \\), let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Transform**: The given transform is \\( F(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\). Here, \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\( z(t) \\) into the Transform**:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_0^T e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} \\, dt = \\int_0^T e^{(i\\omega - s)t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This integral can be evaluated as:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(i\\omega - s)t}}{i\\omega - s} \\right]_0^T = \\frac{e^{(i\\omega - s)T} - 1}{i\\omega - s}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Analyze the Information Provided**:\n   - We know \\( F(z) \\) up to time \\( T \\).\n   - We know \\( s \\) is a complex constant.\n   - We know \\( T \\) is a finite upper limit.\n\n4. **Determine Uniqueness**:\n   - The expression for \\( F(z) \\) depends on both \\( s \\) and \\( T \\).\n   - Without knowledge of \\( s \\), we cannot directly solve for \\( z(t) \\) because the integral form involves \\( s \\) and the specific form of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given only \\( F(z) \\), \\( T \\), and the form of \\( z(t) \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) for all \\( t \\) without knowing the value of \\( s \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
