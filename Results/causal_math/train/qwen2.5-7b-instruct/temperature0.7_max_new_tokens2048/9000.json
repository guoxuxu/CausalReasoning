    "To determine if we can accurately identify the specific constants \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) used in the functions based on their Laplace transforms and the final time-domain output, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Laplace Transform Analysis**:\n   - The given function \\(z(s) = \\frac{1}{s-a}\\) corresponds to \\(f(t) = e^{at} u(t)\\).\n   - Another function \\(g(s) = \\frac{1}{s-b}\\) corresponds to \\(g(t) = e^{bt} u(t)\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication in Laplace Domain**:\n   - If we multiply \\(z(s)\\) and \\(g(s)\\) in the Laplace domain, we get:\n     \\[\n     h(s) = z(s) \\cdot g(s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{s-a}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{s-b}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(s-a)(s-b)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - To find the inverse Laplace transform of \\(h(s)\\), we use partial fraction decomposition:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{(s-a)(s-b)} = \\frac{A}{s-a} + \\frac{B}{s-b}\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n     \\[\n     1 = A(s-b) + B(s-a)\n     \\]\n     Setting \\(s = a\\):\n     \\[\n     1 = A(a-b) \\implies A = \\frac{1}{a-b}\n     \\]\n     Setting \\(s = b\\):\n     \\[\n     1 = B(b-a) \\implies B = \\frac{1}{b-a}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     h(s) = \\frac{1}{a-b} \\left(\\frac{1}{s-a} - \\frac{1}{s-b}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\(h(s)\\) is:\n     \\[\n     h(t) = \\frac{1}{a-b} (e^{at} u(t) - e^{bt} u(t))\n     \\]\n\n4. **Identifying Constants**:\n   - From the expression \\(h(t) = \\frac{1}{a-b} (e^{at} u(t) - e^{bt} u(t))\\), we can see that the constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are clearly identifiable from the exponents of the exponential terms.\n   - However, there is no third constant \\(c\\) mentioned in the problem statement, and the form of the equation does not include any additional constants.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - We can accurately identify the constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the exponents in the time-domain output.\n   - There is no information provided about a third constant \\(c\\), and the form of the equation does not suggest its presence.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
