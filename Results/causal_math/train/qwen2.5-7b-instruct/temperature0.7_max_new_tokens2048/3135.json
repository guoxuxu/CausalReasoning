    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Wave Equation**: The wave equation describes how waves propagate through space and time. It has a specific form that relates the second time derivative to the second spatial derivative.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: When we apply the Fourier transform to the wave equation, we convert the spatial domain into the frequency domain. This transformation helps in analyzing the behavior of waves in terms of their frequency components.\n\n3. **Wave Speed in Fourier Domain**: In the Fourier domain, the wave equation simplifies significantly. The wave speed \\(c\\) appears as a factor in the transformed equation. Specifically, it affects the dispersion relation, which determines how different frequency components propagate.\n\n4. **Intervention at Time \\(t_1\\)**: If the wave speed \\(c\\) is changed at a specific time \\(t_1\\), this intervention will have a localized effect on the wave propagation after that point in time. However, the Fourier transform of the state at any later time \\(T > t_1\\) will still reflect the cumulative effect of all previous wave speeds up to \\(t_1\\).\n\n5. **Independence from Original Wave Speed**: The Fourier-transformed state \\(\\hat{u}(k,T)\\) at a later time \\(T > t_1\\) does not become completely independent of the original wave speed.
