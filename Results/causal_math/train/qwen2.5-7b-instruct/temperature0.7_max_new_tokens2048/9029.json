The Fourier transform itself changes over time due to the time-dependent nature of the Schrödinger equation.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Due to the non-commutative nature of time evolution and the Fourier transform, applying the Fourier transform at \\(t = 0\\) and then evolving in momentum space does not yield the same result as directly evolving \\(\\psi(x, 0)\\) in position space to \\(t = T\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
