    "Let's analyze the given system step by step to determine if the system's output \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) strictly depends on the properties of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(K\\), and \\(D\\) without influence from the transformations \\(C\\) and \\(M\\).\n\n1. **Initial System Dynamics**:\n   - The state vector \\(x(t)\\) evolves according to \\(\\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t)\\).\n   - The output \\(z(t)\\) is given by \\(z(t) = Kx(t) + Du(t)\\).\n\n2. **Intervention \\(v(t) = Ce^{Lt}u(t)\\)**:\n   - This transformation changes the control input \\(u(t)\\) to \\(v(t)\\). However, since \\(v(t)\\) still depends on \\(u(t)\\), the fundamental dynamics of the system (as described by \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(K\\), and \\(D\\)) are not directly altered by \\(C\\) and \\(L\\).
