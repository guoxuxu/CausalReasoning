    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Fourier Transform**: The Fourier Transform \\( F(k) \\) of a function \\( f(x) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi ikx} dx\n   \\]\n\n2. **Effect of Modulation \\( g(x) = e^{ax}f(x) \\)**: When we apply the modulation \\( e^{ax} \\) to \\( f(x) \\), the new function becomes \\( g(x) = e^{ax}f(x) \\).

This can be represented as:\n   \\[\n   G(k) = F(k - a/2\\pi)\n   \\]\n   So, applying \\( e^{ax} \\) changes the Fourier Transform but does not keep it unchanged.\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: If we apply another modulation \\( h(x) = e^{bx}f(x) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), the new function becomes \\( h(x) \\). However, since the Fourier Transform is a linear operation and the system is assumed to be linear, the effect of applying \\( e^{bx} \\) at \\( t_1 \\) will again result in a phase shift in the frequency domain similar to the previous case.\n\n4. **Impact on \\( F(k) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\)**: For \\( T > t_1 \\), if the modulation \\( e^{bx} \\) is applied, the Fourier Transform will change due to the phase shift introduced by the modulation.

This changes the original function to \\( h(x) \\) after \\( t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of \\( h(x) \\)**: The Fourier Transform of \\( h(x) \\) can be derived using properties of the Fourier Transform. Specifically, if \\( F(k) \\) is the Fourier Transform of \\( f(x) \\), then the Fourier Transform of \\( e^{bx}f(x) \\) involves a shift in the frequency domain.
