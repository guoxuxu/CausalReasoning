The coefficient \\( A \\) is the slope of the linear term in the original function, which is not directly affected by the constant matrix \\( U \\) when applied at \\( t = 0 \\).

This means that the value of \\( z \\) at any time \\( t \\) is transformed by the matrix \\( U \\).\n\n3. **Initial Condition**: We need to analyze the transformed curve \\( z(T) \\) where \\( h(z) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\).
