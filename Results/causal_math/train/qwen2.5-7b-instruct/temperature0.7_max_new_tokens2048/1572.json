Specifically, the Fourier transform of \\( z^4 \\) will involve higher-order derivatives of the Dirac delta function centered at zero.\n\n5. **Comparison of Fourier Transforms:**\n   - If no transformation \\( g(z) \\) is applied, then \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f(z)\\}(k) = 2\\pi \\delta(k - a) \\).\n   - If \\( g(z) = z^2 \\), then \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{h(z)\\}(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\{z^4\\}(k) \\), which involves higher-order derivatives of the Dirac delta function.\n\n6. **Deciding Between Transformations:**\n   - By observing the Fourier transform output, we can determine if it involves higher-order derivatives of the Dirac delta function. This would indicate that the transformation \\( g(z) = z^2 \\) was applied.\n   - If the Fourier transform output does not involve such derivatives, it suggests no transformation or another type of transformation was applied.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, if the Fourier transform output shows higher-order derivatives of the Dirac delta function, we can conclude that the transformation \\( g(z) = z^2 \\) was applied.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To analyze this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function and Transformations**:\n   - We have a function \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\), where \\( a \\) is a complex constant.\n   - We apply a Fourier transformation to \\( f(z) \\), resulting in \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f(z)\\}(k) \\).\n   - Two possible transformations are considered: \\( g(z) = z^2 \\) and another unspecified transformation.\n\n2. **Fourier Transformation of \\( f(z) \\)**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{az}\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{az} e^{-2\\pi i k z} dz\n     \\]\n   - This integral can be solved using properties of the Fourier transform and the fact that \\( e^{az} \\) is a Gaussian-like function when \\( a \\) is purely imaginary (which it often is in such contexts).\n\n3. **Effect of \\( g(z) = z^2 \\)**:\n   - If \\( g(z) = z^2 \\), then \\( h(z) = (z^2)^2 = z^4 \\).\n   - Applying the Fourier transform to \\( h(z) = z^4 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{z^4\\}(k) = \\frac{d^4}{dk^4} \\left[ \\mathcal{F}\\{1\\}(k) \\right] = \\frac{d^4}{dk^4} [2\\pi \\delta(k)]\n     \\]\n   - The fourth derivative of the Dirac delta function results in a distribution that is highly non-trivial but distinct from the original Fourier transform of \\( e^{az} \\).\n\n4. **Generalizing to Another Transformation**:\n   - Without specifying the other transformation, we cannot definitively determine what it does to the Fourier transform.\n   - Different transformations will generally result in different outputs, but without knowing the exact nature of the transformation, we cannot conclusively identify which one was applied.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given only the Fourier transform output, it is not possible to definitively determine whether \\( g(z) = z^2 \\) or another unspecified transformation was applied.\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z^4 \\) is a specific known form, but other transformations could produce similar-looking outputs depending on their nature.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
