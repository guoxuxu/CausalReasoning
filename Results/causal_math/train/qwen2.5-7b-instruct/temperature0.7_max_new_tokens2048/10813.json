    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The heat equation given is \\( u_t = \\kappa \\Delta u \\), which describes how the temperature \\( u \\) changes over time \\( t \\) due to diffusion.\n\n2. The problem states that there is no external heat source influencing the system, so \\( h(x, t) = 0 \\).\n\n3. The initial condition is given as \\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\).\n\n4. Without an external heat source, the only factor affecting the temperature distribution is the initial condition and the diffusion process itself.\n\n5. The solution to the heat equation with no external source and a given initial condition can be expressed using the heat kernel (fundamental solution of the heat equation). This means the temperature distribution at any later time \\( t \\) is a convolution of the initial condition \\( u_0(x) \\) with the heat kernel.\n\n6. Importantly, the heat equation is a linear partial differential equation, meaning it satisfies the principle of superposition. This implies that the solution at any time is uniquely determined by the initial condition and the properties of the equation itself.\n\n7. Therefore, if there is no external heat source (\\( h(x, t) = 0 \\)), the temperature distribution at any future time, including \\( t = T \\), is solely determined by the initial temperature distribution \\( u_0 \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

This describes how the temperature \\( u \\) changes over time \\( t \\) due to diffusion, where \\( \\kappa \\) is the thermal diffusivity and \\( \\Delta \\) is the Laplacian operator.\n\n2. **Initial Condition**: The initial temperature distribution is given as \\( u_0 \\), which means at time \\( t = 0 \\), the temperature at any point \\( x \\) is \\( u(x, 0) = u_0(x) \\).\n\n3. **Absence of External Heat Source**: The problem states that there is no external heat source, meaning \\( h(x, t) = 0 \\) for all \\( x \\) and \\( t \\).\n\n4. **Evolution of Temperature Distribution**: Without an external heat source, the only factor influencing the temperature distribution is the initial condition and the diffusion process governed by the heat equation. The solution to the heat equation with no external source and a given initial condition can be found using methods such as separation of variables, Fourier series, or other analytical techniques.\n\n5. **Determination of Temperature at Time \\( t = T \\)**: Given the initial condition \\( u_0 \\) and the absence of an external heat source, the temperature distribution at any future time \\( t \\) (including \\( t = T \\)) is uniquely determined by the initial condition and the properties of the heat equation.

This is crucial for determining the solution at later times.\n\n3. **Effect of External Heat Source**: If there is an external heat source \\( h(x, t) \\), it would add heat to the system at specific regions and times, altering the temperature distribution. However, if \\( h(x, t) = 0 \\), there is no external heat source influencing the system.\n\n4. **Solving the Heat Equation Without External Source**: When \\( h(x, t) = 0 \\), the heat equation simplifies to \\( u_t = \\kappa \\Delta u \\).
