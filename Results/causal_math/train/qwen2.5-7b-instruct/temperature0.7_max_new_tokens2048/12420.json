To find the dynamics of \\(Y_t\\), we use Itô's lemma. According to Itô's lemma for the function \\(f(X_t) = X_t^2\\):\n   \\[\n   dY_t = df(X_t) = 2X_t dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} (2) (dX_t)^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   dY_t = 2X_t (\\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t) + \\sigma^2 X_t^2 dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   dY_t = (2\\mu X_t^2 + \\sigma^2 X_t^2) dt + 2\\sigma X_t^2 dW_t\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   dY_t = ((2\\mu + \\sigma^2) X_t^2) dt + 2\\sigma X_t^2 dW_t\n   \\]\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - The original process \\(X_t\\) evolves according to \\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\).\n   - The transformed process \\(Y_t = X_t^2\\) evolves according to \\(dY_t = ((2\\mu + \\sigma^2) X_t^2) dt + 2\\sigma X_t^2 dW_t\\).\n\nClearly, the dynamics of \\(Y_t = X_t^2\\) are different from those of \\(X_t\\) because the coefficients of the drift and diffusion terms are modified.
