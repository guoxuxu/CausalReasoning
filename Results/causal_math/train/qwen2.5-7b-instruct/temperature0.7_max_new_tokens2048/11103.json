    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal and Transform**: We start with a signal \\(x(t)\\) and its CTFT \\(X(f)\\).\n\n2. **First Modulation**: Multiplying \\(x(t)\\) by \\(e^{2\\pi i f_0 t}\\) in the time domain corresponds to a shift in the frequency domain. Specifically, the Fourier transform of \\(x(t) \\cdot e^{2\\pi i f_0 t}\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t) \\cdot e^{2\\pi i f_0 t}\\} = X(f - f_0)\n   \\]\n   This means that multiplying by \\(e^{2\\pi i f_0 t}\\) shifts the spectrum of \\(X(f)\\) to the left by \\(f_0\\).\n\n3. **Second Modulation**: Now, if we apply another modulation \\(e^{2\\pi i f_1 t}\\) to the result of the first modulation, we get:\n   \\[\n   x(t) \\cdot e^{2\\pi i f_0 t} \\cdot e^{2\\pi i f_1 t} = x(t) \\cdot e^{2\\pi i (f_0 + f_1) t}\n   \\]\n   The Fourier transform of this expression is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t) \\cdot e^{2\\pi i (f_0 + f_1) t}\\} = X(f - (f_0 + f_1))\n   \\]\n   This indicates that the second modulation further shifts the spectrum of the first modulated signal by \\(f_1\\), resulting in a total shift of \\(f_0 + f_1\\).\n\n4. **Final Frequency Spectrum**: Therefore, applying the second modulation \\(e^{2\\pi i f_1 t}\\) after the first modulation results in a shift of the frequency spectrum by \\(f_0 + f_1\\) from the original \\(X(f)\\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the ultimate frequency spectrum will indeed reflect a shift of \\(f_0 + f_1\\) from the original \\(X(f)\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
