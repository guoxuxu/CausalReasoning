The result of the integral is:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{z_0}{s - i \\omega}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the state \\( z(T) \\)**: The state of the system at time \\( T \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i \\omega T} z_0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Analyze the effect of the Laplace transform on \\( z(T) \\)**: The Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) does not directly give us information about the state \\( z(T) \\). Instead, it transforms the function over time into the frequency domain. The value \\( z(T) \\) is specific to a particular time \\( T \\), whereas the Laplace transform provides a representation that depends on \\( s \\).\n\n5. **Consider multiple transformation scenarios**: If the Laplace transform is applied at different times, the resulting \\( Z(s) \\) will be the same because the Laplace transform is a linear operation and the form of \\( z(t) \\) is consistent for all \\( t \\). However, the value of \\( z(T) \\) at a specific time \\( T \\) would be the same regardless of when the Laplace transform is applied, as long as the initial conditions and the function form remain unchanged.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the system's state \\( z(T) \\), it is not possible to determine whether the Laplace transform was applied at any point, because the same state can arise from the same function form regardless of the time of application. The Laplace transform itself does not provide additional information about the specific time at which it was applied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
