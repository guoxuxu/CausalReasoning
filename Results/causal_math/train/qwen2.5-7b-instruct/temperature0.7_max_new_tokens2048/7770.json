    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function \\( u(z) = e^{Az} \\) is given, where \\( A \\) is a constant matrix.

The Fourier transform of \\( e^{Az} \\) and \\( e^{(A+B)z} \\) would look different but could still have overlapping properties if the exact form of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is unknown.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the Fourier transform does not provide enough information to distinguish between different forms of \\( u(z) \\) (like \\( e^{Az} \\) vs. \\( e^{(A+B)z} \\)), we cannot infer the specific form of the original function \\( u(z) \\) solely from \\( F(u(z)) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Function**: The original function is \\(u(z) = e^{Az}\\), where \\(A\\) is a constant matrix.
