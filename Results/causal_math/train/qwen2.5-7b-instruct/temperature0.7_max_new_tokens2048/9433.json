    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with a function \\( z_0(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\). Applying the Fourier transform to \\( z_0(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) gives us \\( F(z_0) \\).\n\n2. **Evolution of \\( z(t) \\)**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\). This means that \\( z(t) \\) is a solution to the linear differential equation, which can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt} z(t) = D z(t)\n   \\]\n   The general solution to this equation is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{Dt} z(0)\n   \\]\n   where \\( z(0) \\) is the initial condition, which in our case is \\( z_0(0) \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**: To find the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\), we need to compute \\( F(z(t)) \\):\n   \\[\n   F(z(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( z(t) = e^{Dt} z_0(0) \\) into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   F(z(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{Dt} z_0(0) dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the exponent, we have:\n   \\[\n   F(z(t)) = z_0(0) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(D - i\\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Transforming the Differential Equation**: Consider the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\). Taking the Fourier transform on both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\left(\\dot{z}\\right) = \\mathcal{F}(Dz)\n   \\]\n   The Fourier transform of the derivative \\( \\dot{z} \\) is \\( i\\omega F(z) \\), and the Fourier transform of \\( Dz \\) is \\( DF(z) \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   i\\omega F(z) = DF(z)\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dF(z)}{d\\omega} = iDF(z)\n   \\]\n   Solving this differential equation for \\( F(z) \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   F(z(t)) = F(z(0)) e^{iDt}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( z(0) = z_0(0) \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   F(z(t)) = F(z_0) e^{iDt}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparing the Two Scenarios**:\n   - If no Fourier transform was applied initially, the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) would still follow \\( z(t) = e^{Dt} z_0(0) \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) in this scenario would be:\n     \\[\n     F(z(t)) = F(z_0) e^{iDt}\n     \\]\n\nSince the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) after applying the Fourier transform at \\( t = 0 \\) and allowing it to evolve follows the same form as if no Fourier transform was applied, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
