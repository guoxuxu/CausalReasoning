Here, \\(Tf\\) represents a Fourier transform over a function \\(f\\). This transformation modifies the state of \\(u\\) but does not change the underlying operator \\(L\\).\n\n3. **Intervention with Transformation \\(h(u)\\)**: At some time \\(t_1\\), another transformation \\(h(u) = (Tg)(u)\\) is applied.
