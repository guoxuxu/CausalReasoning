    "To determine whether \\(Y(ω)\\) depends only on \\(K\\) and not on \\(D\\), let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original System and Fourier Transform:**\n   - The input signal is \\(x(t)\\).\n   - Applying the Fourier Transform gives \\(X(ω) = ℱ\\{x(t)\\}\\).\n   - The system is described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{y} = Ky\\), where \\(K\\) is a constant matrix.\n   - The output of the system is \\(y(t)\\), which transforms to \\(Y(ω) = ℱ\\{y(t)\\}\\).\n\n2. **Intervention with New Function \\(h(t)\\):**\n   - A new function \\(h(t) = e^{Dt}x(t)\\) is introduced as an intervention.\n   - This new function is then transformed to \\(H(ω) = ℱ\\{h(t)\\}\\).\n\n3. **Effect of Intervention on Output \\(y(t)\\):**\n   - Since \\(h(t) = e^{Dt}x(t)\\), we need to find how this affects the output \\(y(t)\\).\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\(h(t)\\) is:\n     \\[\n     H(ω) = ℱ\\{e^{Dt}x(t)\\}\n     \\]\n     Using properties of the Fourier Transform, specifically the frequency shift property:\n     \\[\n     ℱ\\{e^{Dt}x(t)\\} = X(ω - D)\n     \\]\n     Thus, the new input to the system after the intervention is \\(X(ω - D)\\).\n\n4. **Output \\(y(t)\\) with New Input:**\n   - The system remains the same, so the output \\(y(t)\\) is still governed by \\(\\dot{y} = Ky\\).\n   - However, the input now is \\(X(ω - D)\\), leading to the transformed output:\n     \\[\n     Y(ω) = ℱ\\{y(t)\\}\n     \\]\n     Since the system dynamics are linear and time-invariant (LTI), the output transform can be written as:\n     \\[\n     Y(ω) = K^{-1}X(ω - D)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis:**\n   - From the above expression, it is clear that \\(Y(ω)\\) depends on both \\(K\\) and \\(D\\).\n   - Specifically, the term \\(X(ω - D)\\) shows that the dependence on \\(D\\) is through the transformation of the input spectrum.\n\nGiven the analysis, \\(Y(ω)\\) does indeed depend on \\(D\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
