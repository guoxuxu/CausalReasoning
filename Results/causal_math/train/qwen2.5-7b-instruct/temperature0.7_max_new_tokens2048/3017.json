Therefore, the roots are \\(r = -1\\) and \\(r = -2\\).\n   - The general solution to the differential equation is \\(u(t) = A e^{-t} + B e^{-2t}\\). Applying the initial conditions \\(u(0) = 0\\) and \\(u'(0) = 0\\):\n     - From \\(u(0) = A + B = 0\\), we get \\(B = -A\\).\n     - From \\(u'(t) = -A e^{-t} - 2B e^{-2t}\\) and \\(u'(0) = -A - 2B = 0\\), substituting \\(B = -A\\) gives \\(-A + 2A = 0\\), which is always true.\n   - Therefore, the solution simplifies to \\(u(t) = A (e^{-t} - e^{-2t})\\).

Therefore, \\( U(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} \\cdot 0 \\, dt = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Comparison with Original System**: If we had not applied the transformation function, the original differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 3\\frac{du}{dt} + 2u = 0 \\) would have a general solution involving exponential functions (since the characteristic equation \\( r^2 + 3r + 2 = 0 \\) has roots -1 and -2). However, the specific initial conditions would determine the exact form of the solution.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the transformation function sets \\( u(t) \\) to zero at \\( t = 0 \\) and keeps it zero for all \\( t \\geq 0 \\), the Laplace transform \\( U(s) \\) at \\( s = 1 \\) will be zero in both cases (with and without the transformation function). \n\nTherefore, the Laplace transform \\( U(s) \\) at \\( s = 1 \\) will be the same whether \\( f(u) \\) is applied or not.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial System**: The original differential equation governing \\( u(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 3\\frac{du}{dt} + 2u = 0\n   \\]\n   The Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   U(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} u(t) dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Transformation Function**: The transformation function is \\( f(u) = \\sin(t)u \\). When \\( f(u) \\) is applied at \\( t = 0 \\), it modifies the initial conditions of \\( u(t) \\).\n\n3. **Behavior Analysis**:\n   - Applying \\( f(u) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) means that the initial conditions for \\( u(t) \\) are modified by multiplying with \\( \\sin(0)u(0) = 0 \\). This implies no change to the initial value of \\( u(0) \\), but there might be an effect on the initial derivative due to the product rule.\n   - The differential equation remains the same, so the form of \\( u(t) \\) after applying the transformation will still satisfy the same differential equation.\n   - The Laplace transform \\( U(s) \\) is a function of the initial conditions and the differential equation. Since the differential equation itself does not change, and the initial value of \\( u(0) \\) remains unchanged, only the initial derivative might be affected slightly by the multiplication with \\( \\sin(t) \\).\n\n4. **Laplace Transform Comparison**:\n   - If we directly solve the differential equation for \\( u(t) \\) without any transformation, the Laplace transform \\( U(s) \\) will be determined by the initial conditions and the form of the differential equation.\n   - Applying \\( f(u) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) only affects the initial conditions slightly (if at all, since \\( \\sin(0) = 0 \\)), but it does not fundamentally alter the form of the solution or the Laplace transform.\n\nGiven these points, the Laplace transform \\( U(s) \\) at \\( s = 1 \\) should remain the same whether \\( f(u) \\) is applied or not, because the differential equation and the initial conditions (except possibly a minor perturbation which does not affect the overall transform significantly) remain the same.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThe Laplace transform \\( U(s) \\) at \\( s = 1 \\) will not necessarily be the same if \\( f(u) \\) is applied at \\( t = 0 \\) compared to evolving \\( u(t) \\) directly without applying \\( f(u) \\)."
