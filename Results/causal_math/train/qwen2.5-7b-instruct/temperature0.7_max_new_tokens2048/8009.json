When \\(g(u_0) = Au_0 + h\\) is evolved under the heat equation, it also follows the solution to the heat equation but with the modified initial condition.\n\n5. The key point here is whether applying \\(g(u)\\) to \\(u_0\\) and then evolving it under the heat equation results in the same solution as directly evolving \\(u_0\\) under the heat equation.\n\n6. The heat equation is linear, meaning that if we have two solutions \\(u_1(x,t)\\) and \\(u_2(x,t)\\) corresponding to initial conditions \\(u_1(x,0)\\) and \\(u_2(x,0)\\), then \\(c_1u_1(x,t) + c_2u_2(x,t)\\) is also a solution corresponding to the initial condition \\(c_1u_1(x,0) + c_2u_2(x,0)\\).\n\n7.
