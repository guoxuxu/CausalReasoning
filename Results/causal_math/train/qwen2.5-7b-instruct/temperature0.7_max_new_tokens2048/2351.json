    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal Transformation**: The signal \\( x(t) \\) is first transformed into the frequency domain using the Fourier transform, resulting in \\( X(f) \\).\n\n2. **Applying Transfer Function \\( H(f) \\)**: The signal \\( X(f) \\) is then modified by the transfer function \\( H(f) \\), producing \\( X_H(f) = H(f)X(f) \\).
