    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the PDE and its solution**: The given PDE is \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + k^2 u = 0\\). This is a standard second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The general solution to this equation is \\(u(x) = A e^{ikx} + B e^{-ikx}\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: When we apply the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to \\(u(x)\\), we get \\(U(k)\\).

If \\(U(k)\\) has peaks at specific values of \\(k\\), these correspond to the values of \\(k\\) in the original function \\(u(x)\\).\n\n4. **Change in \\(k\\)**: To determine if \\(k\\) was changed at some point during the evolution, we need to see if the peaks in \\(U(k)\\) change over time. However, since the PDE does not explicitly depend on time but rather on \\(k\\), any change in \\(k\\) would imply a different solution form. If \\(k\\) were to change, the form of \\(U(k)\\) would reflect that change.\n\n5. **Analysis of \\(U(k)\\) at time T**: At time \\(T\\), if \\(k\\) was not changed, then \\(U(k)\\) should still have the same peaks as at earlier times, corresponding to the same values of \\(k\\). If there is a change in \\(k\\), the form of \\(U(k)\\) would reflect a new set of peaks, indicating a change in the underlying \\(k\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we can conclude that changes in \\(k\\) would be reflected in the form of \\(U(k)\\).
