The backtransformed function \\(\\hat{g}(t)\\) is different from \\( g(t) \\), leading to a different solution \\( x(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "To determine whether the solution \\( x(t) \\) to the differential equation remains identical when the initial function \\( g(t) \\) is replaced by its Fourier transform \\(\\hat{g}(\\omega)\\) backtransformed to the time domain, let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Fourier Transform of \\( g(t) \\)**:\n   The Fourier transform of \\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{g}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-at^2} e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral can be evaluated using known properties of Gaussian functions and their Fourier transforms. The result is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{g}(\\omega) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}} e^{-\\frac{\\omega^2}{4a}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Backtransforming \\(\\hat{g}(\\omega)\\) to Time Domain**:\n   The inverse Fourier transform of \\(\\hat{g}(\\omega)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\hat{g}(\\omega)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}} e^{-\\frac{\\omega^2}{4a}} e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this expression:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\hat{g}(\\omega)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{a\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{\\omega^2}{4a}} e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Gaussian integral again, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\hat{g}(\\omega)\\} = e^{-at^2}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the backtransformed function is indeed \\( g(t) \\).\n\n3. **Solving the Differential Equation with \\( g(t) \\)**:\n   The original differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = g(t)\n   \\]\n   The solution to this equation depends on the specific form of \\( g(t) \\). For \\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\), the solution involves integrating the forcing term \\( e^{-at^2} \\).\n\n4. **Solving the Differential Equation with \\(\\hat{g}(\\omega)\\) Backtransformed**:\n   If we replace \\( g(t) \\) with \\(\\hat{g}(\\omega)\\) backtransformed to the time domain (which is \\( g(t) \\)), the differential equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + bx = e^{-at^2}\n   \\]\n   This is the same as the original differential equation, so the solution will be identical.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the solution \\( x(t) \\) to the differential equation remains identical when the initial function \\( g(t) \\) is replaced by its Fourier transform \\(\\hat{g}(\\omega)\\) backtransformed to the time domain.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
