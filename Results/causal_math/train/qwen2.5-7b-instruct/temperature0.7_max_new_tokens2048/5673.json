Directly applying the transfer function to the time-domain signal without transformation would not yield the same result because the operations in the time and frequency domains are not equivalent without the intermediate transformation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Fourier Transform of the Input Signal**: The input signal \\( x(t) \\) is transformed into its frequency domain representation \\( F(x)(\\omega) \\) using the Fourier Transform:\n   \\[\n   F(x)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Filtering in Frequency Domain**: The transformed signal \\( F(x)(\\omega) \\) is then filtered by the system characterized by the transfer function \\( H(\\omega) \\). The output in the frequency domain after filtering is:\n   \\[\n   Y(\\omega) = H(\\omega) F(x)(\\omega)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Inverse Fourier Transform to Get Output Signal**: To obtain the output signal \\( y(t) \\) in the time domain, we apply the inverse Fourier Transform to \\( Y(\\omega) \\):\n   \\[\n   y(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{Y(\\omega)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} Y(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( Y(\\omega) = H(\\omega) F(x)(\\omega) \\):\n   \\[\n   y(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H(\\omega) F(x)(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n\n4. **Direct Application of Transfer Function**: If we were to directly apply the transfer function \\( H(\\omega) \\) to the original signal \\( x(t) \\) without transforming it first, we would get:\n   \\[\n   Y_{direct}(\\omega) = H(\\omega) X(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   where \\( X(\\omega) \\) is the Fourier Transform of \\( x(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   X(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform for Direct Application**: Applying the inverse Fourier Transform to \\( Y_{direct}(\\omega) \\):\n   \\[\n   y_{direct}(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{Y_{direct}(\\omega)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H(\\omega) X(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n\n6. **Comparison**: Comparing the two expressions for \\( y(t) \\) and \\( y_{direct}(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   y(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H(\\omega) F(x)(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y_{direct}(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H(\\omega) X(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n\n   Since \\( F(x)(\\omega) \\) and \\( X(\\omega) \\) are the same (both being the Fourier Transform of \\( x(t) \\)), we can see that:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = y_{direct}(t)\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the resultant output signal \\( y(t) \\) will indeed be the same whether the signal is transformed and then filtered, or if the transfer function is applied directly to the original signal without transformation.\n\nOutput:\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}"
