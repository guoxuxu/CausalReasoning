This transformation involves a phase shift and scaling in the complex plane.\n\n3. **Implication of Transformation on Potential**: When we apply \\(f(z)\\) to the potential \\(V(x, y)\\), it does not change the harmonic nature of \\(V\\). However, it does modify the potential in a way that depends on the spatial coordinates through the exponential term.\n\n4. **Boundary Conditions and Inversion**: To determine the original boundary conditions from the transformed potential, we would need to know how the transformation affects the boundary values.

This function maps points in the complex plane to other points in the complex plane. Importantly, it preserves angles but not distances. This means that while the geometry of the boundary might change, the angles between curves on the boundary remain the same.\n\n2. **Laplace Equation**: The Laplace equation \\(\\nabla^2 V = 0\\) describes a harmonic function. Harmonic functions have the property that their values at any point are determined by the average of their values on any circle centered at that point.

For example, a circular boundary can be mapped to another shape via the exponential function, but the potential inside would remain the same.\n\n4. **Inference of Original Boundary**: Given only the potential \\(V\\) inside the domain after the transformation, it is impossible to uniquely determine the original boundary without additional information.
