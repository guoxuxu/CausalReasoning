    "To address this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the transformations involved.\n\n1. **Original Sequence**: We have a sequence \\(z_n\\) for \\(n = 0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\).\n2. **Transformation**: Each element \\(z_n\\) is transformed by the function \\(f(z) = e^{iz}\\), resulting in a new sequence \\(f(z_n) = e^{iz_n}\\).\n3. **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**: The DFT is applied to both the original sequence and the transformed sequence.\n4. **Question**: Will the spectrum obtained from the DFT of the transformed sequence be the same as the spectrum obtained from the DFT of the original sequence?\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(Z_k\\) as the DFT of the original sequence \\(z_n\\).\n- \\(F_k\\) as the DFT of the transformed sequence \\(e^{iz_n}\\).\n\nThe DFT of a sequence \\(x_n\\) is given by:\n\\[ X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2\\pi kn/N} \\]\n\nFor the original sequence \\(z_n\\):\n\\[ Z_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} z_n e^{-i2\\pi kn/N} \\]\n\nFor the transformed sequence \\(e^{iz_n}\\):\n\\[ F_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{iz_n} e^{-i2\\pi kn/N} \\]\n\\[ F_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{i(z_n - 2\\pi kn/N)} \\]\n\nNotice that the term inside the exponent in the transformed sequence can be rewritten using properties of exponents:\n\\[ F_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{i(z_n - 2\\pi k n / N)} \\]\n\nThis expression shows that the DFT of the transformed sequence is essentially a phase-shifted version of the original sequence. Specifically, it is a phase shift by \\(-2\\pi k n / N\\).\n\nSince the DFT operation is linear and only shifts the phase of the frequency components without changing their magnitudes, the spectrum (which consists of the magnitudes of the DFT coefficients) will remain the same, but the phase information will change.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude spectrum of the DFT of the transformed sequence \\(F_k\\) will be identical to the magnitude spectrum of the DFT of the original sequence \\(Z_k\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To determine whether the spectrum of the DFT of the transformed sequence \\(f(z_n)\\) is the same as the spectrum of the DFT of the original sequence \\(z_n\\), we need to consider the properties of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the transformation function \\(f(z) = e^{iz}\\).\n\nStep 1: **Transformation of Sequence**  \nGiven the sequence \\(z_n\\) for \\(n = 0, 1, ..., N-1\\), the transformed sequence is given by:\n\\[ f(z_n) = e^{iz_n} \\]\n\nStep 2: **Applying DFT to Transformed Sequence**  \nThe DFT of the transformed sequence can be expressed as:\n\\[ F(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{iz_n} e^{-2\\pi i nk/N} \\]\nThis can be rewritten using the property of exponentials:\n\\[ F(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{i(z_n - 2\\pi nk/N)} \\]\n\nStep 3: **Applying DFT to Original Sequence**  \nThe DFT of the original sequence \\(z_n\\) is:\n\\[ Z(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} z_n e^{-2\\pi i nk/N} \\]\n\nStep 4: **Comparing the Two Spectra**  \nTo compare \\(F(k)\\) and \\(Z(k)\\), observe that:\n\\[ F(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{i(z_n - 2\\pi nk/N)} \\]\nand\n\\[ Z(k) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} z_n e^{-2\\pi i nk/N} \\]\n\nFor the spectra to be identical, the terms inside the sums must match up in a way that the phase shift does not alter the overall spectrum. However, the term \\(e^{-2\\pi nk/N}\\) introduces a phase shift that depends on both \\(k\\) and \\(n\\). This phase shift means that the transformed sequence \\(f(z_n)\\) will generally have a different spectrum than the original sequence \\(z_n\\), unless there is a specific relationship between \\(z_n\\) and \\(2\\pi nk/N\\) that cancels out the phase shift.\n\nStep 5: **Conclusion**  \nGiven that the phase shift introduced by \\(e^{-2\\pi nk/N}\\) in the transformed sequence \\(f(z_n)\\) does not generally cancel out with the original sequence \\(z_n\\), the spectra of the DFT of the transformed sequence and the DFT of the original sequence will not be the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
