  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "The transformations both modify the state in a non-trivial exponential manner linked to time, making it challenging to reverse engineer the specific transformations or sequence of transformations used. Multiple combinations of parameters (\\\\( \\\\alpha \\\\), \\\\( \\\\beta \\\\), and their timings) might lead to the same final observed state due to the overlapping effects on growth, decay, and rotations induced in the complex plane.",
