We can only confirm that \\( g(z) \\) was used.",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Functions:**\n   - \\( f(z) = e^z \\)\n   - \\( g(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{sz} ds \\)\n   - \\( h(z) \\) is not explicitly defined but seems to be another function that could relate to \\( g(z) \\).\n   - \\( z(T) \\) is the value of \\( z \\) at time \\( T \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Transformations:**\n   - The function \\( f(z) \\) transforms \\( z \\) into \\( e^z \\).\n   - The function \\( g(z) \\) integrates \\( e^{sz} \\) from 0 to \\( T \\). This means \\( g(z) \\) depends on both \\( s \\) and \\( z \\).\n   - \\( z(T) \\) is the result of applying some transformation (either \\( g(z) \\) or \\( h(z) \\) or both) to the initial value of \\( z \\) over the interval [0, T].\n\n3. **Determining the Use of Functions:**\n   - To determine if only \\( h(z) \\), only \\( g(z) \\), or both were used, we need to look at the final expression for \\( z(T) \\).\n   - Since \\( g(z) \\) involves an integral, it directly incorporates the function \\( e^{sz} \\) which is derived from \\( f(z) \\).\n   - Without additional information about \\( h(z) \\), we cannot definitively say if \\( h(z) \\) was used or not.\n\n4. **Final Determination:**\n   - Given only \\( f(z) \\) and the final \\( z(T) \\), we can trace back the transformations.\n   - If \\( z(T) \\) is derived solely from \\( g(z) \\), then we know \\( h(z) \\) was not involved.\n   - If \\( z(T) \\) is derived from both \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\), then both were used.\n   - However, with the given information, we cannot conclusively determine if \\( h(z) \\) was used or not because \\( z(T) \\) could be a direct result of \\( g(z) \\) without involving \\( h(z) \\).\n\nSince we do not have enough information to definitively say whether \\( h(z) \\) was used or not, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
