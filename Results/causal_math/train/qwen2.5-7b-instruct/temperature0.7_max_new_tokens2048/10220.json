    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the given integral**: We have \\(\\oint_C \\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\).

By Cauchy's integral formula, this integral also evaluates to \\(2\\pi i e^{a^2}\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The intervened integral result can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     \\oint_C \\left( \\frac{z + e^{z^2}}{z-a} \\right) dz = 0 + 2\\pi i e^{a^2} = 2\\pi i e^{a^2}\n     \\]\n   - Knowing only the result of the intervened integral does not provide direct information about whether the original \\( \\frac{1}{z-a} \\) was modified because the intervention involves adding \\( \\frac{z}{z-a} \\), which does not affect the original integral since it evaluates to zero.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we cannot conclusively determine that an intervention modified the original \\( \\frac{1}{z-a} \\) based solely on the result of the intervened integral.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Contour Integral**:\n   - The original integral is given as \\(\\oint_C \\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\).\n   - This integral is a standard form of a contour integral in complex analysis, which evaluates to \\(2\\pi i\\) if \\(C\\) is a simple closed contour around \\(a\\) (by Cauchy's integral formula).\n\n2. **Intervention**:\n   - We introduce a modification to the integrand from \\(\\dfrac{1}{z-a}\\) to \\(z + \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a}\\).\n   - The new integral is \\(\\oint_C \\left(z + \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a}\\right) dz\\).\n\n3. **Decomposing the New Integral**:\n   - The new integral can be split into two parts:\n     \\[\n     \\oint_C \\left(z + \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a}\\right) dz = \\oint_C z \\, dz + \\oint_C \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a} dz.\n     \\]\n   - The first part, \\(\\oint_C z \\, dz\\), is zero because the integrand \\(z\\) is analytic inside and on the contour \\(C\\) (it has no singularities within \\(C\\)).\n   - The second part, \\(\\oint_C \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a} dz\\), is the same as the original integral \\(\\oint_C \\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\) but with the function \\(e^{z^2}\\) in the numerator instead of 1. Since \\(e^{z^2}\\) is also analytic everywhere, it does not affect the residue at \\(z=a\\), and thus the value of the integral remains \\(2\\pi i\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both integrals evaluate to \\(2\\pi i\\), meaning that the intervention did not change the overall result of the integral.\n\nTherefore, knowing the result of the intervened integral does not allow us to conclusively determine that the intervention modified the original \\(\\dfrac{1}{z-a}\\). The result of both integrals would be the same due to the nature of the integrands and the properties of contour integration.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Integral**:\n   - The original integral is given as \\(\\oint_C \\dfrac{dz}{z-a}\\).\n   - This integral is known to be \\(2\\pi i\\) if \\(C\\) is a simple closed contour around \\(a\\), according to the residue theorem.\n\n2. **Intervention and New Integral**:\n   - We have a new integrand \\(z + \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a}\\).\n   - We need to consider the integral \\(\\oint_C \\left(z + \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a}\\right) dz\\).\n\n3. **Breaking Down the New Integral**:\n   - The new integral can be split into two parts: \\(\\oint_C z \\, dz + \\oint_C \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a} \\, dz\\).\n   - The first part, \\(\\oint_C z \\, dz\\), is zero because the integrand \\(z\\) is an entire function (holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane), and the integral of any entire function over a closed contour is zero.\n   - The second part, \\(\\oint_C \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a} \\, dz\\), is \\(2\\pi i\\) times the residue of \\(\\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a}\\) at \\(z=a\\).\n\n4. **Residue Calculation**:\n   - The residue of \\(\\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a}\\) at \\(z=a\\) is \\(e^{a^2}\\) because \\(e^{z^2}\\) is holomorphic and does not affect the residue calculation.\n   - Therefore, \\(\\oint_C \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a} \\, dz = 2\\pi i e^{a^2}\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The total integral \\(\\oint_C \\left(z + \\dfrac{e^{z^2}}{z-a}\\right) dz = 0 + 2\\pi i e^{a^2} = 2\\pi i e^{a^2}\\).\n   - Knowing the result of the intervened integral, which is \\(2\\pi i e^{a^2}\\), does not directly tell us if an intervention was made to the original \\(\\dfrac{1}{z-a}\\). The presence of \\(e^{z^2}\\) in the integrand already modifies the original integral, so the result itself indicates an intervention.\n\nSince the presence of \\(e^{z^2}\\) in the integrand inherently changes the nature of the integral, we cannot conclusively determine from just the result whether an intervention was made specifically to the original \\(\\dfrac{1}{z-a}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
