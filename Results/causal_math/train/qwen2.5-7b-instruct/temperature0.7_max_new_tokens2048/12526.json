    "To determine if the endpoint \\( w(z) \\) for \\( z > z_1 \\) depends only on \\( k \\) and not on \\( c \\) or the initial modification, let's analyze the given differential equations and transformations step by step.\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**: \n   The original differential equation is \\( \\frac{d}{dz} w = kw \\). This is a first-order linear differential equation with the general solution:\n   \\[\n   w(z) = Ce^{kz}\n   \\]\n   where \\( C \\) is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( f(z) \\)**:\n   Applying the transformation \\( f(z) = e^z \\) does not directly affect the form of the differential equation because it is simply a change of variable. The transformed equation would still be \\( \\frac{d}{dz} w = kw \\).\n\n3. **Intervention by \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   At some complex point \\( z_1 \\), the intervention is to apply \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\). This intervention can be interpreted as a change in the variable \\( z \\) itself, but it does not fundamentally alter the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dz} w = kw \\) unless \\( c \\neq 1 \\).\n\n4. **Effect of \\( g(z) \\) on Solutions**:\n   If we consider the solution after applying the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\), the new variable \\( z' = cz \\) transforms the original equation. However, the transformed equation in terms of \\( z' \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dz'} w = \\frac{1}{c} \\cdot kw\n   \\]\n   This shows that the effective rate of change is scaled by \\( \\frac{1}{c} \\).\n\n5. **Endpoint Analysis**:\n   - For the original solution without any intervention, the endpoint \\( w(z) \\) for \\( z > z_1 \\) is \\( Ce^{kz} \\).\n   - If we apply the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\) at \\( z_1 \\), the solution in terms of the new variable \\( z' = cz \\) becomes \\( Ce^{kz/c} \\) when transformed back.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   The endpoint \\( w(z) \\) for \\( z > z_1 \\) will be influenced by both \\( k \\) and \\( c \\). Specifically, the endpoint will be \\( Ce^{kz/c} \\), which clearly depends on both \\( k \\) and \\( c \\).\n\nTherefore, the endpoint \\( w(z) \\) for \\( z > z_1 \\) does depend on \\( c \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether the endpoint \\( w(z) \\) for \\( z > z_1 \\) depends only on \\( k \\) and not on \\( c \\) or the initial modification, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup with Function \\( f(z) \\):**\n   - We have the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dz} w = kw \\).\n   - The general solution to this differential equation is \\( w(z) = A e^{kz} \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n2. **Intervention with Function \\( g(z) \\):**\n   - At some complex point \\( z_1 \\), we introduce a new function \\( g(z) = e^{cz} \\).\n   - This intervention changes the form of the differential equation to \\( \\frac{d}{dz} w = (k + c)w \\).\n\n3. **New Differential Equation:**\n   - With the intervention, the new differential equation becomes \\( \\frac{d}{dz} w = (k + c)w \\).\n   - The general solution to this new differential equation is \\( w(z) = B e^{(k+c)z} \\), where \\( B \\) is another constant determined by initial conditions after the intervention.\n\n4. **Behavior for \\( z > z_1 \\):**\n   - For \\( z > z_1 \\), the solution will be influenced by both the original constant \\( k \\) and the additional constant \\( c \\).\n   - The form of the solution \\( w(z) = B e^{(k+c)z} \\) clearly shows that the endpoint \\( w(z) \\) for \\( z > z_1 \\) depends on both \\( k \\) and \\( c \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the endpoint \\( w(z) \\) for \\( z > z_1 \\) explicitly includes the term \\( e^{cz} \\) due to the intervention, it cannot depend solely on \\( k \\). The presence of \\( c \\) in the exponent means that the endpoint does depend on \\( c \\).\n\nTherefore, the endpoint \\( w(z) \\) for \\( z > z_1 \\) does depend on \\( c \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
