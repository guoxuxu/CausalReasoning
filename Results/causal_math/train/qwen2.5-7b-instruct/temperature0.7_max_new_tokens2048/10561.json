    "To determine if the Laplace transform \\( L(z) \\) of \\( z(t) = e^{ikt} \\) depends solely on the parameter \\( k \\) when no manipulations are applied at initial time or during the transformation, we need to perform the Laplace transform step-by-step.\n\n1. **Given Function**: \n   \\[ z(t) = e^{ikt} \\]\n   \n2. **Laplace Transform Definition**:\n   \\[ L(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{ikt} \\, dt \\]\n\n3. **Combine Exponentials**:\n   \\[ L(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-ik)t} \\, dt \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   The integral converges for real parts of \\( s \\) greater than the real part of \\( ik \\). Since \\( k \\) is a complex number, let \\( k = a + bi \\) where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are real numbers.\n   \\[ L(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-a-ib)t} \\, dt \\]\n   Let \\( \\sigma = \\text{Re}(s) \\) and \\( \\omega = -\\text{Im}(k) = -b \\):\n   \\[ L(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(\\sigma - i\\omega)t} \\, dt \\]\n\n5. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts**:\n   \\[ L(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-\\sigma t} e^{-i\\omega t} \\, dt \\]\n   This can be split into real and imaginary parts but the overall result will still depend on both \\( \\sigma \\) and \\( \\omega \\).\n\n6. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   \\[ L(z) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-(\\sigma - i\\omega)t}}{-(\\sigma - i\\omega)} \\right]_0^\\infty \\]\n   For the integral to converge, \\( \\sigma > 0 \\). Evaluating at the limits:\n   \\[ L(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma - i\\omega} \\]\n\n7. **Final Expression**:\n   \\[ L(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma - i\\omega} \\]\n   Here, \\( \\sigma \\) and \\( \\omega \\) are dependent on \\( s \\) and \\( k \\) respectively. Specifically, \\( \\sigma = \\text{Re}(s) \\) and \\( \\omega = -\\text{Im}(k) \\).\n\nSince \\( L(z) \\) includes terms that depend on both the real part of \\( s \\) (which can vary) and the imaginary part of \\( k \\) (which defines \\( \\omega \\)), it does not solely depend on \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
