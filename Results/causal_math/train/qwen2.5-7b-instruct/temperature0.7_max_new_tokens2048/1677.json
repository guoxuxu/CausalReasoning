Then,\n     \\[\n     I = \\left[ \\frac{e^{iBt}}{iB} \\right]_0^T = \\frac{e^{iT B} - 1}{iB}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore,\n     \\[\n     h(g) = e^{iAz} \\cdot \\frac{e^{iT B} - 1}{iB}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Compare Properties**:\n   - Original function \\( g(z) = e^{iAz} \\) has certain properties (e.g., periodicity, magnitude).\n   - Transformed function \\( h(g) = e^{iAz} \\cdot \\frac{e^{iT B} - 1}{iB} \\).\n\n5. **Analyze the Transformation**:\n   - The term \\( \\frac{e^{iT B} - 1}{iB} \\) is a scalar factor that depends on \\( T \\) and \\( B \\).\n   - This scalar factor modifies the original function \\( g(z) \\) but does not change its fundamental form (it remains an exponential function with a modified amplitude and phase).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The function \\( h(g)(z) \\) holds the same general form as \\( g(z) \\), but it is scaled by a factor that depends on \\( T \\) and \\( B \\). Therefore, while the structure of the function remains similar, specific properties such as exact amplitude and phase might differ.\n\nGiven the analysis, the function \\( h(g)(z) \\) does not exactly hold the same properties as \\( g(z) \\) multiplied by the integral factor because the integral introduces a scaling factor that affects the overall amplitude and phase.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **Definition of \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   - \\( g(z) = e^{iAz} \\)\n   - Here, \\( A \\) is a constant matrix and \\( z \\) is a complex variable.\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**:\n   - The transformation \\( h(g) \\) is defined as:\n     \\[\n     h(g) = \\int_0^T e^{iBt} g(z) \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( B \\) is another constant matrix and \\( T \\) is the upper limit of the integral.\n\n3. **Properties of \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   - \\( g(z) \\) is a complex exponential function of \\( z \\).\n\n4. **Transformation Analysis**:\n   - Let's substitute \\( g(z) \\) into the integral transformation:\n     \\[\n     h(g) = \\int_0^T e^{iBt} e^{iAz} \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - Combine the exponentials:\n     \\[\n     h(g) = \\int_0^T e^{i(Az + Bt)} \\, dt\n     \\]\n\n5. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   - To evaluate the integral, we need to integrate the expression \\( e^{i(Az + Bt)} \\) with respect to \\( t \\):\n     \\[\n     h(g) = \\int_0^T e^{i(Az + Bt)} \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - This can be separated into:\n     \\[\n     h(g) = e^{iAz} \\int_0^T e^{iBt} \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - The integral part is:\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^T e^{iBt} \\, dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{iBt}}{iB} \\right]_0^T = \\frac{e^{iT B} - 1}{iB}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     h(g) = e^{iAz} \\cdot \\frac{e^{iT B} - 1}{iB}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Comparison with \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   - The original function \\( g(z) = e^{iAz} \\).\n   - The transformed function \\( h(g) = e^{iAz} \\cdot \\frac{e^{iT B} - 1}{iB} \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The transformed function \\( h(g) \\) includes an additional factor \\( \\frac{e^{iT B} - 1}{iB} \\), which means it does not hold the same properties as \\( g(z) \\) alone. The presence of this additional factor changes the nature of the function.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
