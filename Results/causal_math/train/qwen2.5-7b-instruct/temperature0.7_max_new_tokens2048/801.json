This means that the initial temperature distribution \\( u_0(x) \\) is modified to \\( u_0'(x) = u_0(x) + e^{wx} \\).\n\n3. **Effect on the PDE**: When we apply the transformation to the initial condition, the new initial condition becomes \\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) + e^{wx} \\).

This means the new initial condition becomes \\( u_0(x) + e^{wx} \\).\n\n2. **Evolution Under the PDE**: The given partial differential equation (PDE) is \\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\), which is the heat equation. The solution to this PDE can be found using various methods such as separation of variables, Fourier series, or integral transforms.\n\n3. **Effect of the Transformation on the Solution**: When we apply the transformation \\( g(u) = u + e^{wx} \\) to the initial condition, the new initial condition is \\( u_0(x) + e^{wx} \\). If we denote the solution to the PDE with this new initial condition as \\( u(x, t) \\), it must satisfy:\n   \\[\n   u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\quad \\text{with} \\quad u(x, 0) = u_0(x) + e^{wx}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Comparison with Direct Evolution**: If we evolve the original initial condition \\( u_0(x) \\) directly under the PDE, the solution would be some function \\( v(x, t) \\) that satisfies:\n   \\[\n   v_t + v_{xx} = 0 \\quad \\text{with} \\quad v(x, 0) = u_0(x)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Analyzing the Difference**: The key difference is the initial condition. The transformation \\( g(u) \\) modifies the initial condition by adding \\( e^{wx} \\). Since the PDE is linear and the added term \\( e^{wx} \\) does not change over time (it is independent of \\( t \\)), the solution to the PDE with the transformed initial condition will be different from the solution with the original initial condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The temperature profile \\( u(x, t) \\) at time \\( t = T \\) will not be the same as if \\( u_0(x) \\) was directly evolved to \\( t = T \\) under the PDE \\( u_t + u_{xx} = 0 \\). The addition of \\( e^{wx} \\) to the initial condition will propagate through the evolution and affect the temperature profile.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
