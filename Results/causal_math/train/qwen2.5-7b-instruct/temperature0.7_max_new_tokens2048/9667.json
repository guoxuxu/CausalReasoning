Applying \\( g \\) to the current state \\( e^{i(A+B)t_1} \\):\n   \\[\n   g(e^{i(A+B)t_1}) = e^{iCt_1}e^{i(A+B)t_1} = e^{i(A+B+C)t_1}\n   \\]\n   Now, the state is \\( e^{i(A+B+C)t_1} \\).\n\n4. **Final State z(T)**: For \\( T > t_1 \\), the state evolves further according to \\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\). Thus, from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\), the state changes as:\n   \\[\n   e^{i(A+B+C)t_1} \\cdot e^{iA(T-t_1)} = e^{iA(T-t_1 + t_1 + B + C)} = e^{iA T + i(B+C)}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The final state \\( z(T) \\) is \\( e^{iAT} \\cdot e^{i(B+C)} \\).\n   - The term \\( e^{i(B+C)} \\) is a constant phase shift that does not affect the dependency on \\( A \\).\n   - Therefore, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends on \\( A \\) but not directly on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\) beyond their combined effect.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze the given transformations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation \\( z(t) = e^{iAt} \\)**:\n   - This represents a rotation by angle \\( A \\) over time \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\)**:\n   - This is an additional rotation by angle \\( B \\) over time \\( t \\).\n   - If applied to \\( z(t) \\), it becomes \\( f(z(t)) = e^{iBt}e^{iAt} = e^{i(A+B)t} \\).\n\n3. **New Transformation \\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\)**:\n   - This introduces a further rotation by angle \\( C \\) over time \\( t \\).\n   - If applied to \\( f(z(t)) \\), it becomes \\( g(f(z(t))) = e^{iCt}e^{i(A+B)t} = e^{i(A+B+C)t} \\).\n\nNow, we need to determine the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) after applying the intervention \\( g(z) \\):\n\n- Initially, at time \\( t_1 \\), the state of \\( z \\) is \\( z(t_1) = e^{i(A+B)t_1} \\).\n- The intervention \\( g(z) \\) is applied at \\( t_1 \\), which means the transformation is applied from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\):\n  - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the transformation is \\( g(f(z(t_1))) = e^{iC(t-t_1)}e^{i(A+B)t_1} \\).\n  - Simplifying, we get \\( z(T) = e^{iC(T-t_1)}e^{i(A+B)t_1} \\).\n\nThe endpoint \\( z(T) \\) can be written as:\n\\[ z(T) = e^{i(A+B)t_1}e^{iC(T-t_1)} = e^{i((A+B)t_1 + C(T-t_1))} \\]\n\nThis expression shows that the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( A \\) and \\( C \\). However, it does not depend on \\( B \\) anymore once the intervention \\( g(z) \\) is applied because the initial \\( B \\) term is already included in the initial state \\( e^{i(A+B)t_1} \\).\n\nThus, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will depend on \\( A \\) and \\( C \\), but not on \\( B \\) anymore after the intervention \\( g(z) \\) is applied.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
