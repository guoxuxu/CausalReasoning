In general, for polynomials, factorization is unique up to the order of factors and their signs. However, for functions in the Laplace domain, especially when they are not polynomials, the factorization is not necessarily unique. \n\n4. **Example of Non-Uniqueness**: Consider the simple example where \\( U(s) = s \\).
