Let's denote \\( v = f(u) \\). Then,\n   \\[\n   v(t) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} u \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Space Derivative**: The space derivative of \\( v \\) can be obtained by differentiating the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta v = \\Delta \\left( \\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} u \\, dt \\right)\n   \\]\n   Since differentiation and integration are linear operations, we can bring the Laplacian inside the integral (assuming \\( u \\) is sufficiently smooth):\n   \\[\n   \\Delta v = \\int_{0}^{T} \\Delta (e^{At} u) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n5. **Time Derivative**: The time derivative of \\( v \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left( \\int_{0}^{T} e^{At} u \\, dt \\right)\n   \\]\n   Using the Leibniz rule for differentiating under the integral sign:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (e^{At} u) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T} A e^{At} u \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n6. **Applying Laplace's Equation**: For \\( v \\) to satisfy Laplace's equation \\( \\Delta v = 0 \\), we need:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{T} \\Delta (e^{At} u) \\, dt = 0\n   \\]\n   This implies that the integral of the Laplacian of the transformed function must be zero.
