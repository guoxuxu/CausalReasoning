    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System Dynamics**:\n   - The system is described by \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\), which means the state \\( z(t) \\) evolves over time according to the matrix exponential of \\( A \\) and the initial state \\( z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Intervention**:\n   - An intervention is introduced through the perturbation function \\( g(z) = Cz \\).

    "To determine if we can exactly backtrack to determine whether the intervention \\( g(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) was applied based solely on the state \\( z(T) \\) observed at time \\( T \\), let's analyze the given information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State Transformation**:\n   - The initial state is transformed over time according to \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\).\n   - At time \\( T \\), the state is \\( z(T) = e^{AT}z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Intervention Application**:\n   - An intervention \\( g(z) = Cz \\) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\).\n   - This means that after \\( t_1 \\), the state evolves as \\( z(t) = e^{A(t-t_1)}Cz(t_1) \\).\n\n3. **Post-Intervention State**:\n   - If no intervention occurred, the state at \\( t_1 \\) would be \\( z(t_1) = e^{A(t_1-T)}z(T) \\).\n   - With the intervention, the state at \\( t_1 \\) becomes \\( z(t_1) = Cz(T) \\).\n\n4. **Backtracking from \\( z(T) \\)**:\n   - To determine if the intervention occurred, we need to check if \\( z(T) \\) can uniquely identify whether \\( g(z) \\) was applied.\n   - If \\( C \\) is invertible, then applying \\( g(z) \\) would result in a unique transformation of \\( z(T) \\) to \\( Cz(T) \\).\n   - Conversely, if \\( C \\) is not invertible, there might be multiple possible states \\( z(T) \\) that could lead to the same post-intervention state \\( z(t_1) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - For the intervention to be uniquely identifiable, \\( C \\) must be invertible.\n   - If \\( C \\) is not invertible, it is impossible to determine with certainty whether the intervention occurred just from \\( z(T) \\).\n\nGiven that the problem does not specify that \\( C \\) is invertible, we cannot assume it is always invertible.
