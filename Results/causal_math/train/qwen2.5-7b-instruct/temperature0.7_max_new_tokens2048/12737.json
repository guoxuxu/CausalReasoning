    "To determine if we can precisely deduce the original time-domain function \\( z(0) \\) from the Fourier-transformed representation of \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( T \\), let's break down the process step by step.\n\n1. **Original Function**: The given function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Definition**:\n   The Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\) of \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i 2\\pi f t} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i 2\\pi f t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the exponent:\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - 2\\pi f)t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This integral is a well-known result in Fourier analysis, yielding a Dirac delta function:\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Fourier Transform at Time \\( T \\)**:\n   Applying the Fourier transform to \\( z(t) \\) does not depend on the specific time \\( T \\). The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is simply the Dirac delta function centered at \\( f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\):\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Deducing \\( z(0) \\)**:\n   To find \\( z(0) \\), we need to evaluate the original function at \\( t = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   z(0) = e^{i\\omega \\cdot 0} = e^0 = 1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Reconstructing from Fourier Transform**:\n   The Fourier transform provides information about the frequency content of the signal but does not directly give the amplitude at any specific time point without additional information. Specifically, the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) tells us that the signal has all its energy concentrated at frequency \\( \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\), but it does not provide the phase or the value at specific times like \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nGiven the above steps, we cannot precisely deduce \\( z(0) \\) solely from the Fourier-transformed representation of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
