This transform converts the time-domain representation of the system into its frequency-domain representation.\n\n3. **Time Evolution and Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of the time-evolved state \\( \\vec{z}(t) \\) at some \\( t > 0 \\) would be \\( F(\\vec{z})(\\omega) \\). However, the inverse operation is also true: if we start from the frequency domain \\( F(\\vec{z})(\\omega) \\), we can apply the inverse Fourier transform to get back to the time domain \\( \\vec{z}(t) \\).\n\n4. **Initial State Consideration**: The key point here is that the Fourier transform is a reversible process. If the initial state \\( \\vec{z}(0) \\) is known, applying the Fourier transform will give us \\( F(\\vec{z})(\\omega) \\). Conversely, if we know \\( F(\\vec{z})(\\omega) \\), we can determine \\( \\vec{z}(t) \\) for any \\( t \\) using the inverse Fourier transform.\n\n5. **No Additional Information**: The problem statement mentions \"assuming no additional information on initial conditions or state transformation.\" This means we cannot use any other information about the system's history or the specific form of \\( M \\) to deduce the initial state from just the evolved state \\( \\vec{z}(t) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given only the time-evolved state \\( \\vec{z}(t) \\) at some \\( t > 0 \\) and without any additional information, it is not possible to ascertain whether the initial state was subjected to the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform is a one-to-one mapping between the time and frequency domains, but knowing only the evolved state does not provide enough information to determine the initial condition or whether the Fourier transform was applied to it.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
