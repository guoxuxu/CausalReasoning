    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We have a complex-valued function \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant matrix and \\( z_0 \\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The integral transformation is given by \\( T(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t) \\, dt \\), where \\( B \\) is another complex constant matrix.\n\n3. **Intervention**: An additional transformation \\( U(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\) within the interval \\( [0, T] \\).
