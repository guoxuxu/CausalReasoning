    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding Complex Integration**: The integral \\(\\int_{\\gamma} f(z) \\, dz\\) represents the line integral of a function \\(f(z)\\) along a contour \\(\\gamma\\) in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Poles and Residues**: A pole is a point where the function becomes infinite. For complex functions, the behavior around poles is crucial for determining the value of integrals.\n\n3. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**: This theorem states that if a function is analytic (holomorphic) in a simply connected domain, then the integral of the function over any closed contour in that domain is zero. However, this doesn't apply directly here because we're considering the effect of a pole.\n\n4. **Cauchy's Integral Formula for Residues**: If a function has a single isolated singularity (pole) at \\(z_0\\) inside a simple closed contour \\(\\gamma\\), then:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{\\gamma} f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}(f, z_0)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\text{Res}(f, z_0)\\) is the residue of \\(f\\) at \\(z_0\\).\n\n5. **Effect of Introducing a Pole**: When a pole is introduced inside \\(\\gamma\\), it means there is now a singularity within the contour. According to Cauchy's Integral Formula, the integral will no longer be zero but will depend on the residue at that pole.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, introducing a pole inside the contour \\(\\gamma\\) will generally change the value of the integral \\(\\int_{\\gamma} f(z) \\, dz\\), unless the function \\(f(z)\\) is modified in such a way that the residue at the new pole is zero.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Complex Integration and Contours**: We're dealing with complex integration along a closed contour \\(\\gamma\\) in the complex plane. The function \\(f(z)\\) is being integrated over this contour.\n\n2. **Pole Inside the Contour**: A pole inside the contour \\(\\gamma\\) means there's a point \\(z_0\\) within the region bounded by \\(\\gamma\\) where \\(f(z)\\) is not analytic (i.e., it has a singularity).\n\n3. **Residue Theorem**: According to the Residue Theorem, if \\(f(z)\\) is analytic inside and on the contour \\(\\gamma\\) except for a finite number of singular points (poles) inside \\(\\gamma\\), then:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{\\gamma} f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\sum \\text{Res}(f, z_k)\n   \\]\n   where the sum is over all poles \\(z_k\\) inside \\(\\gamma\\).\n\n4. **Effect of Introducing a Pole**: If we introduce a new pole inside \\(\\gamma\\), the function \\(f(z)\\) will no longer satisfy the conditions of the Residue Theorem as stated above. However, the integral itself does not change immediately because the theorem only guarantees a specific result when certain conditions are met.\n\n5. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem and Cauchy's Integral Formula**: Even without the Residue Theorem, Cauchy's Integral Theorem states that for an analytic function \\(f(z)\\) inside and on a simple closed contour \\(\\gamma\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int_{\\gamma} f(z) \\, dz = 0\n   \\]\n   But this applies only if \\(f(z)\\) is analytic everywhere inside and on \\(\\gamma\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Introducing a pole inside the contour \\(\\gamma\\) changes the nature of \\(f(z)\\). If \\(f(z)\\) was originally analytic, it is no longer analytic due to the introduction of the pole. Therefore, the original integral may not be zero anymore, and the value of the integral can indeed change.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We're dealing with complex integration along a closed contour γ in the complex plane. The function f(z) might have poles within or outside this contour.\n\n2. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**: If f(z) is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on the contour γ, then the integral ∫γ f(z) dz = 0. However, if there are poles inside γ, this theorem does not apply directly.\n\n3. **Cauchy's Integral Formula for Residues**: For a function f(z) that has isolated singularities (poles) inside a simple closed contour γ, the integral can be evaluated using the formula:\n   \\[ \\oint_\\gamma f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\sum \\text{Res}(f, a_i) \\]\n   where the sum is over all residues at the poles \\(a_i\\) inside γ.\n\n4. **Effect of Introducing a Pole**: If we introduce a new pole inside γ without changing anything else about the contour or the function, it will contribute an additional term to the integral according to the residue theorem. This means the value of the integral will change unless the residue at this new pole is zero.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since introducing a pole inside the contour will generally change the value of the integral unless the residue at that pole is zero (which is a special case), we can conclude that the introduction of a pole typically affects the value of the integral.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
