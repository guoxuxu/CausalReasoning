However, we are asked about the effect of an external force described by a Dirac delta function.\n\n2. **Applying the Dirac Delta Function**: When a Dirac delta function \\( f(t) = \\delta(t - t_0) \\) is applied as an external force at time \\( t_0 \\), it represents an impulse at that specific moment. This impulse will have a significant effect on the system's behavior at that instant.\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of the Impulse Response**: The Laplace transform of the Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(t - t_0) \\) is \\( e^{-s t_0} \\). So, if the external force is an impulse at time \\( t_0 \\), its Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) will be \\( e^{-s t_0} \\).\n\n4. **Transforming the Differential Equation**: The Laplace transform of the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = f(t) \\) with initial conditions \\( x(0) = 0 \\) and \\( \\dot{x}(0) = 0 \\) (assuming zero initial conditions for simplicity) would yield:\n   \\[\n   s^2 X(s) + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 s X(s) + \\omega_0^2 X(s) = F(s)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\frac{F(s)}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 s + \\omega_0^2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substituting \\( F(s) \\)**: Substituting \\( F(s) = e^{-s t_0} \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\frac{e^{-s t_0}}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 s + \\omega_0^2}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform of \\( X(s) \\) gives the response \\( x(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   x(t) = u(t - t_0) \\cdot e^{-\\zeta\\omega_0 (t - t_0)} \\sin(\\omega_d (t - t_0))\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\omega_d = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2} \\) is the damped natural frequency and \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The transformed output \\( X(s) \\) does indeed depend on the original parameters \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\). However, the presence of the term \\( e^{-s t_0} \\) indicates that the response also depends on the time of application \\( t_0 \\) of the impulse. Therefore, the transformed output is not solely dependent on \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\); it also depends on the timing of the impulse.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
