    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: The system is defined by the iterative equation \\(z' = z^2 + c\\).

The system evolves from an initial state \\(z_0\\) over a period \\(T\\).\n\n2. **Initial State and Evolution**: The evolution of the system can be described as:\n   - At time \\(t = 0\\), \\(z = z_0\\).\n   - For each subsequent time step, \\(z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c\\), where \\(z_n\\) is the value of \\(z\\) at the current time step.\n\n3. **Dependence on Initial State and Constant**:\n   - The initial state \\(z_0\\) clearly influences the evolution of the system.\n   - The constant \\(c\\) also plays a crucial role in determining how the system evolves because it directly adds to the square of the current state.\n\n4. **Reversibility and Causal Inference**:\n   - Given the non-linear nature of the transformation (squaring), it is generally not possible to uniquely determine the previous state from the next state due to the inherent complexity and potential for multiple solutions.\n   - The evolution depends on both \\(z_0\\) and \\(c\\), but knowing the final state and \\(c\\) alone does not guarantee the ability to uniquely infer \\(z_0\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The outcome at any point in time after \\(T\\) steps does indeed depend on both \\(z_0\\) and \\(c\\). However, the question asks if the outcome solely depends on these two parameters.\n   - While \\(z_0\\) and \\(c\\) are critical, other factors such as the exact sequence of iterations and the specific values of intermediate states can influence the final outcome, making it not solely dependent on just these two parameters.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
