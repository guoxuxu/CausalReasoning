This means that at \\( t1 \\), the state of \\( z \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   z(t1) \\rightarrow z'(t1) = e^{Ct1}z(t1)\n   \\]\n   The new initial condition for the subsequent evolution will be \\( z'(t1) \\).\n\n3. **Post-intervention Evolution**: After the intervention at \\( t1 \\), the function continues to evolve according to the original differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Az \\). Therefore, from \\( t1 \\) to \\( T \\), the state can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z'(t1)e^{A(t-t1)} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t1 < t \\leq T\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( z'(t1) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{Ct1}z(t1)e^{A(t-t1)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final State at \\( T \\)**: To find the final state \\( z(T) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{Ct1}z(t1)e^{A(T-t1)}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( z(t1) = z(0)e^{At1} \\), we substitute this into the expression for \\( z(T) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{Ct1}z(0)e^{At1}e^{A(T-t1)} = z(0)e^{At}e^{Ct1}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**: The final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( A \\) and \\( C \\).
