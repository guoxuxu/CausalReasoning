    "To determine if \\( u(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) will be the same when \\( g(t) = h(t) = te^{kt} \\) versus when \\( g(t) = 0 \\), let's analyze the given differential equation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation**: \n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\frac{du}{dt} + u = g(t)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Case 1: \\( g(t) = 0 \\)**\n   - The differential equation simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\frac{du}{dt} + u = 0\n     \\]\n   - This is a homogeneous second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients.\n   - The characteristic equation is:\n     \\[\n     r^2 + 2r + 1 = 0 \\implies (r+1)^2 = 0 \\implies r = -1 \\text{ (repeated root)}\n     \\]\n   - The general solution is:\n     \\[\n     u(t) = (c_1 + c_2t)e^{-t}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Case 2: \\( g(t) = h(t) = te^{kt} \\)**\n   - The differential equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\frac{du}{dt} + u = te^{kt}\n     \\]\n   - This is a non-homogeneous second-order linear differential equation.\n   - To solve it, we need both the complementary solution (solution to the homogeneous part) and a particular solution (to the non-homogeneous part).\n\n4. **Complementary Solution**:\n   - As calculated earlier, the complementary solution is:\n     \\[\n     u_c(t) = (c_1 + c_2t)e^{-t}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Particular Solution**:\n   - We use the method of undetermined coefficients. Assume a particular solution of the form:\n     \\[\n     u_p(t) = Ate^{kt}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\( u_p(t) \\) into the differential equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(Ate^{kt}) + 2\\frac{d}{dt}(Ate^{kt}) + Ate^{kt} = te^{kt}\n     \\]\n   - Compute the derivatives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(Ate^{kt}) = A(k^2te^{kt} + 2kte^{kt} + e^{kt})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{dt}(Ate^{kt}) = A(ke^{kt} + te^{kt}k)\n     \\]\n   - Substitute these into the differential equation:\n     \\[\n     A(k^2te^{kt} + 2kte^{kt} + e^{kt}) + 2A(ke^{kt} + te^{kt}k) + Ate^{kt} = te^{kt}\n     \\]\n     Simplify:\n     \\[\n     A(k^2t + 2kt + 1 + 2k + tk) = te^{kt}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     A(k^2 + 3k + 1)t + A(k^2 + 2k + 1) = te^{kt}\n     \\]\n     Since \\( k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)^2 \\):\n     \\[\n     A(k^2 + 3k + 1)t + A(k+1)^2 = te^{kt}\n     \\]\n     Equate coefficients:\n     \\[\n     A(k+1)^2 = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{(k+1)^2}\n     \\]\n     So, the particular solution is:\n     \\[\n     u_p(t) = \\frac{te^{kt}}{(k+1)^2}\n     \\]\n\n6. **General Solution**:\n   - Combine the complementary and particular solutions:\n     \\[\n     u(t) = (c_1 + c_2t)e^{-t} + \\frac{te^{kt}}{(k+1)^2}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     u(0) = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{du}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = 0 \\implies c_2 - \\frac{k}{(k+1)^2} = 0 \\implies c_2 = \\frac{k}{(k+1)^2}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the solution is:\n     \\[\n     u(t) = \\left(\\frac{k}{(k+1)^2}t + t\\right)e^{-t} + \\frac{te^{kt}}{(k+1)^2}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Comparison at \\( t = T \\)**:\n   - For \\( g(t) = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     u(T) = \\left(\\frac{k}{(k+1)^2}T + T\\right)e^{-T}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( g(t) = te^{kt} \\):\n     \\[\n     u(T) = \\left(\\frac{k}{(k+1)^2}T + T\\right)e^{-T} + \\frac{Te^{kT}}{(k+1)^2}\n     \\]\n   - Clearly, the solutions are different due to the additional term \\( \\frac{Te^{kT}}{(k+1)^2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
