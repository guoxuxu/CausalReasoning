This transformation modifies the state vector \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Applying Transformation**: At \\(t = 0\\), we apply the transformation to the initial state vector \\(x_0\\).

Thus, the state at any time \\(t\\) after applying the transformation is:\n   \\[\n   x(t) = e^{Dt}(Mx_0 + N)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(e^{Dt}\\) is the state transition matrix, which describes how the system evolves over time.\n\n5. **Direct Evolution Without Transformation**: If we had not applied the transformation, the state would evolve directly from \\(x_0\\) according to \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\):\n   \\[\n   x_{\\text{direct}}(t) = e^{Dt}x_0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Comparison at Time \\(t = T\\)**: To determine if the states are the same at \\(t = T\\), we compare \\(x(T)\\) and \\(x_{\\text{direct}}(T)\\):\n   \\[\n   x(T) = e^{DT}(Mx_0 + N)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x_{\\text{direct}}(T) = e^{DT}x_0\n   \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since \\(e^{DT}x_0 \\neq e^{DT}(Mx_0 + N)\\) unless \\(N = 0\\), the states are generally different at \\(t = T\\).
