Thus, the correct answer should be {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}, because the Laplace transform is a mathematical tool that can solve the differential equation to give the same current response over time.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation**: The given differential equation is \\( I'(t) = L \\cdot V(t) + R \\cdot I(t) \\). Here, \\( L \\) is the inductance, \\( R \\) is the resistance, and \\( V(t) \\) is the time-dependent voltage source.\n\n2. **Role of Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform is used to convert the time-domain function \\( V(t) \\) into the frequency domain \\( V(s) \\). This transformation simplifies the differential equation to an algebraic equation in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Transforming the Differential Equation**: Applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation \\( I'(t) = L \\cdot V(t) + R \\cdot I(t) \\) yields:\n   - \\( sI(s) - I(0) = L \\cdot V(s) + R \\cdot I(s) \\)\n   - Rearranging gives \\( (s - R)I(s) = L \\cdot V(s) + I(0) \\)\n   - Solving for \\( I(s) \\) gives \\( I(s) = \\frac{L \\cdot V(s) + I(0)}{s - R} \\)\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To find \\( I(t) \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( I(s) \\):\n   - \\( I(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{L \\cdot V(s) + I(0)}{s - R}\\right\\} \\)\n   - Using linearity and properties of the inverse Laplace transform, this can be simplified but generally involves complex calculations depending on \\( V(t) \\).\n\n5. **Effect of Modifying Voltage Source at t=0**: If the voltage source \\( V(t) \\) is modified at \\( t = 0 \\) by applying the Laplace transform, it fundamentally changes how the system evolves over time.
