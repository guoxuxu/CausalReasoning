    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have an integral \\(\\oint_C h(g(z)) \\, dz\\) where \\(g(z)\\) is a power series and \\(h(z)\\) is some unknown function.

In this case, knowing the value of this integral alone wouldn't tell us much about \\(h(z)\\) because many different functions could give the same integral over a closed path.\n   - For more complex \\(g(z)\\), the situation doesn't improve; the integral \\(\\oint_C h(g(z)) \\, dz\\) is still dependent on both \\(g(z)\\) and \\(h(z)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that we don't know \\(g(z)\\), there are infinitely many possible functions \\(h(z)\\) that could produce the same integral for any given \\(g(z)\\).\n   - Therefore, knowing only the endpoint integral \\(\\oint_C h(g(z)) \\, dz\\) is not sufficient to uniquely determine \\(h(z)\\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
