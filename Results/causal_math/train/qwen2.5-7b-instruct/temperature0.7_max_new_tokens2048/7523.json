Since \\(h(x)e^{-t}\\) is independent of \\(f(t, x)\\), the final temperature profile \\(u(T, x)\\) will also be independent of \\(f(t, x)\\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To determine if the final temperature profile \\( u(T, x) \\) at time \\( T \\) is independent of the initial function \\( f(t, x) \\) after applying the new controlled heat input \\( g(t, x) = h(x)e^{-t} \\) at a later time \\( t = t_1 \\), let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The original heat equation is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\partial_t u(t, x) = k \\partial_{xx} u(t, x) + f(t, x)\n   \\]\n   This equation describes how the temperature \\( u(t, x) \\) changes over time due to diffusion (with coefficient \\( k \\)) and an external heating function \\( f(t, x) \\).\n\n2. **Intervention**: At time \\( t = t_1 \\), a new controlled heat input \\( g(t, x) = h(x)e^{-t} \\) is applied. This can be considered as an additional term in the heat equation starting from \\( t = t_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\partial_t u(t, x) = k \\partial_{xx} u(t, x) + f(t, x) + g(t, x) \\quad \\text{for } t \\geq t_1\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final Temperature Profile**: We need to determine if the final temperature profile \\( u(T, x) \\) at time \\( T \\) depends on the initial heating function \\( f(t, x) \\). To do this, we should consider the solution to the heat equation in two phases:\n   - From \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = t_1 \\): The temperature profile evolves according to the original equation with the initial heating function \\( f(t, x) \\).\n   - From \\( t = t_1 \\) to \\( t = T \\): The temperature profile evolves according to the modified equation with both the initial heating function \\( f(t, x) \\) and the new controlled heat input \\( g(t, x) \\).\n\n4. **Independence Analysis**:\n   - The effect of the initial heating function \\( f(t, x) \\) up to \\( t = t_1 \\) will be \"frozen\" at \\( t = t_1 \\) because the PDE is linear. This means that once the system reaches \\( t = t_1 \\), the temperature profile at that moment will not change due to the initial conditions.\n   - The new controlled heat input \\( g(t, x) = h(x)e^{-t} \\) starts at \\( t = t_1 \\) and influences the temperature profile from that point onward. However, since \\( g(t, x) \\) decays exponentially, its effect diminishes over time.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the nature of the exponential decay in \\( g(t, x) \\), the influence of the initial heating function \\( f(t, x) \\) on the final temperature profile \\( u(T, x) \\) at time \\( T \\) is significant only until \\( t = t_1 \\). After \\( t_1 \\), the temperature profile is primarily influenced by \\( g(t, x) \\), which does not depend on \\( f(t, x) \\) anymore.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature profile \\( u(T, x) \\) at time \\( T \\) is not independent of the initial function \\( f(t, x) \\) because the effect of \\( f(t, x) \\) is still present in the system up to \\( t = t_1 \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
