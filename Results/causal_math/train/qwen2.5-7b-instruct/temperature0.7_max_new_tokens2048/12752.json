This implies \\( x = \\frac{u - b}{a} \\) and \\( dx = \\frac{du}{a} \\).\n\n3. **Substitute the Transformation**:\n   Substituting \\( x \\) and \\( dx \\) into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(\\frac{u - b}{a})^2} \\cos(t(\\frac{u - b}{a})) \\frac{du}{a}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the exponent and argument of cosine:\n   \\[\n   I = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{(u - b)^2}{a^2}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{t(u - b)}{a}\\right) \\, du\n   \\]\n\n4. **Analyze the Result**:\n   The transformed integral has the same form as the original integral but with different parameters. Specifically, it involves a shifted Gaussian function and a phase-shifted cosine function. The key point here is that the structure of the integral remains similar, but the parameters have changed.\n\n5. **Impact on Function Behavior**:\n   The transformation \\( u = ax + b \\) shifts and scales the Gaussian function and the cosine function. However, the fundamental properties of the integral (such as its convergence and the form of the integrand) do not fundamentally change. The integral still represents a product of a Gaussian function and a cosine function over the entire real line.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Despite the transformation, the nature of the integral does not fundamentally change. The result will be a modified version of the original integral, but it will not yield a completely different value unless specific values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are chosen in a way that changes the integral's behavior significantly (which is not the case here).\n\nGiven this analysis, the result of the integral does not change in a fundamental way due to the transformation.

    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Original Integral**: The original integral is \\( I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\cos(tx) \\, dx \\).\n\n2. **Transformation of Variables**: We apply the transformation \\( u = ax + b \\). This implies \\( x = \\frac{u - b}{a} \\) and \\( dx = \\frac{du}{a} \\).\n\n3. **Substitute into the Integral**: Substituting these into the integral gives:\n   \\[\n   I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(\\frac{u-b}{a})^2} \\cos(t(\\frac{u-b}{a})) \\frac{du}{a}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Exponent and Cosine Term**:\n   - The exponent simplifies to \\( e^{-(\\frac{u-b}{a})^2} = e^{-\\frac{(u-b)^2}{a^2}} \\).\n   - The cosine term becomes \\( \\cos(t(\\frac{u-b}{a})) = \\cos(\\frac{tu - tb}{a}) \\).\n\n5. **Rewrite the Integral**:\n   \\[\n   I = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{(u-b)^2}{a^2}} \\cos(\\frac{tu - tb}{a}) \\, du\n   \\]\n\n6. **Analyze the Result**: Notice that the integral now has a similar form but with different parameters. Specifically, it involves a Gaussian-like function and a cosine function, both of which are shifted versions of the original integrand.\n\n7. **Impact on the Function's Behavior**: The transformation does not fundamentally change the nature of the integral. It merely shifts and scales the argument of the exponential and cosine functions. However, the overall structure remains the same.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Despite the shift and scaling, the integral still represents the same type of function (Gaussian multiplied by a cosine). Therefore, the value of the integral will remain unchanged because the integral itself is a specific known result that doesn't depend on the variable names or the exact form of the transformation as long as the limits and the nature of the integrand remain the same.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the result of the integral does not change when applying the transformation \\( u = ax + b \\) upfront.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
