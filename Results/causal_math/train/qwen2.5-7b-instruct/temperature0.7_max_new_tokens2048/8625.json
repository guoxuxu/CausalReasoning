It is defined as:\n   \\[\n   f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\int_{\\gamma - iT}^{\\gamma + iT} e^{st} F(s) ds\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\gamma \\) is chosen such that all singularities of \\( F(s) \\) lie to the left of the line \\( \\text{Re}(s) = \\gamma \\).\n\n4. **Impact of No Further Operations**: If no further operations are applied to \\( F(s) \\) after computing the Laplace Transform, then \\( F(s) \\) indeed retains all the information about \\( f(t) \\). The inverse Laplace Transform can be applied to \\( F(s) \\) to retrieve \\( f(t) \\) exactly (under certain conditions, like the function being well-behaved and the existence of the inverse transform).\n\nGiven this analysis, if the Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) \\) is computed and no further operations are applied, the resultant function \\( F(s) \\) does carry all information about \\( f(t) \\) unaltered.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
