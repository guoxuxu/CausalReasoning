    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation**: At \\(t = 0\\), we have \\(z' = e^{i\\omega \\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0\\).

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Transformation of \\( z \\):**\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), the complex number \\( z_0 \\) undergoes the transformation \\( z' = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\).\n   - This means that \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation:**\n   - The function \\( g(z) \\) is defined as \\( g(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-i\\omega t}z(t) dt \\).\n   - Substituting \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\) into the integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     g(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-i\\omega t}(e^{i\\omega t}z_0) dt = \\int_{0}^{T} z_0 dt.\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the integral, we have:\n     \\[\n     g(z) = z_0 \\int_{0}^{T} dt = z_0 [t]_{0}^{T} = z_0 T.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Analysis of Dependence:**\n   - From the above calculation, it is clear that \\( g(z) \\) depends on both \\( \\omega \\) (through the form of \\( z(t) \\)) and \\( z_0 \\).\n   - However, the specific value of \\( \\omega \\) does not appear in the final expression for \\( g(z) \\). The integral simplifies such that \\( \\omega \\) cancels out in the process of integration.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Despite the presence of \\( \\omega \\) in the transformation, the final result of \\( g(z) \\) is simply \\( z_0 T \\), which shows that \\( g(z) \\) only depends on \\( z_0 \\) and \\( T \\), but not directly on \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\( g(z) \\) does not solely depend on \\( \\omega \\) and \\( z_0 \\); it also depends on \\( T \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
