    "To determine if the original function \\( f(t) \\) can be accurately determined solely from \\( H(s) \\) after applying a convolution with \\( G(s) \\), let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform and Convolution:**\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) is \\( F(s) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is \\( G(s) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of the convolution \\( f(t) * g(t) \\) is given by the product of their individual Laplace transforms: \\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\).\n\n2. **Given Information:**\n   - We know \\( H(s) \\), which is the Laplace transform of the convolution \\( f(t) * g(t) \\).\n   - We need to determine if we can uniquely recover \\( f(t) \\) from \\( H(s) \\).\n\n3. **Recovering \\( F(s) \\):**\n   - From \\( H(s) = F(s)G(s) \\), we can attempt to solve for \\( F(s) \\) by dividing both sides by \\( G(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\frac{H(s)}{G(s)}\n     \\]\n   - This division is valid as long as \\( G(s) \\neq 0 \\) for all \\( s \\) in the region of convergence (ROC) of \\( H(s) \\).\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform:**\n   - Once we have \\( F(s) \\), we can find \\( f(t) \\) by taking the inverse Laplace transform:\n     \\[\n     f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{H(s)}{G(s)}\\right\\}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Uniqueness and Invertibility:**\n   - The inverse Laplace transform is generally not unique unless additional constraints are provided (e.g., initial conditions or other functional forms of \\( f(t) \\)).\n   - However, under typical assumptions where \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) are well-behaved and \\( G(s) \\) does not have zeros in the ROC of \\( H(s) \\), the recovery is possible.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the above steps, it is theoretically possible to determine \\( f(t) \\) from \\( H(s) \\) if \\( G(s) \\) does not introduce any singularities in the ROC of \\( H(s) \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
