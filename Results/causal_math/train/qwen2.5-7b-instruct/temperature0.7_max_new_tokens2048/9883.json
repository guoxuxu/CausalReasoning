It modifies \\(u(x, t)\\) at \\(t_1\\), but its effect on the subsequent evolution of \\(u(x, t)\\) depends on how it is applied.\n   - If the wavelet transform \\(W(u)\\) is applied to \\(u(x, t)\\) at \\(t_1\\), it changes the initial condition for the PDE at that moment. The new initial condition after the wavelet transform is applied will influence the solution of the PDE from \\(t_1\\) onwards.\n\n3. **Impact on Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier transform \\(F(u)(\\xi, T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will be influenced by the new initial condition due to the wavelet transform. Since the wavelet transform changes the initial condition, the solution to the PDE will change from \\(t_1\\) onwards, which will affect the Fourier transform.\n   - Therefore, the final Fourier transformed state \\(F(u)(\\xi, T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will indeed be influenced by the wavelet transform, as it alters the initial condition of the PDE.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the final Fourier transformed state \\(F(u)(\\xi, T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will be influenced by the wavelet transform \\(W(u)\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
