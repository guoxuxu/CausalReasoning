    "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Equation**:\n   The Laplace equation \\( \\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\) describes a steady-state situation where the potential \\( \\phi \\) does not change over time. In a two-dimensional context, if we consider \\( z = x + iy \\) as our complex variable, the Laplace equation can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = 0.\n   \\]\n\n2. **Initial Boundary Condition**:\n   Initially, the boundary condition is perturbed by the complex function \\( h(z) = e^{i \\omega z} \\). This introduces a specific wave-like disturbance that affects the potential \\( \\phi \\).\n\n3. **Effect of \\( h(z) \\)**:\n   When \\( h(z) \\) is applied as a boundary condition, it influences the solution \\( \\phi \\) through the boundary conditions. The exact form of \\( \\phi \\) depends on how \\( h(z) \\) is applied and the geometry of the domain. However, once the boundary condition is set, it affects the entire solution space.\n\n4. **Subsequent Change in Boundary Condition**:\n   At a later time \\( t_1 \\), the boundary condition is changed to include \\( g(z) = e^{-i \\omega z} \\). This new boundary condition starts influencing the potential \\( \\phi \\) from this point onwards.\n\n5. **Independence of Initial Condition**:\n   To determine whether the potential \\( \\phi(z, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends solely on the new boundary condition \\( g(z) \\) and not on the initial condition \\( h(z) \\), we need to consider the evolution of \\( \\phi \\) over time. \n\n6. **Wave Propagation**:\n   Both \\( h(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) represent waves traveling in opposite directions. If these waves interact within the domain (e.g., through superposition), their combined effect will influence the potential \\( \\phi \\). However, after \\( t_1 \\), any further evolution of \\( \\phi \\) will be primarily driven by the new boundary condition \\( g(z) \\) because the effect of \\( h(z) \\) would have been fully accounted for up to \\( t_1 \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   While the initial condition \\( h(z) \\) has an immediate effect on \\( \\phi \\) until \\( t_1 \\), its influence diminishes after \\( t_1 \\) as the new boundary condition \\( g(z) \\) takes over. Therefore, for \\( T > t_1 \\), the potential \\( \\phi(z, T) \\) should be primarily determined by the new boundary condition \\( g(z) \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
