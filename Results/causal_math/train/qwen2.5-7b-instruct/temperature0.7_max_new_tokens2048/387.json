The resulting integral will not still be \\( 2\\pi i \\) if the radius changes from 1 to 2 mid-calculation, because the radius change itself is part of the path definition and does not affect the integral value for a single continuous path around the origin.

This is due to the Cauchy integral formula for a simple closed curve around a singularity.\n\n2. **Change in Radius**: If we change the radius from 1 to 2 at mid-calculation, we are essentially changing the path of integration from a circle of radius 1 to a circle of radius 2. \n\n3. **Impact on Integral**: The integral of \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\) over a circle of radius \\( r \\) centered at 0 is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\oint_{|z|=r} \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Ind}(z=0; C)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\text{Ind}(z=0; C) \\) is the winding number of the curve \\( C \\) around the point \\( z=0 \\).
