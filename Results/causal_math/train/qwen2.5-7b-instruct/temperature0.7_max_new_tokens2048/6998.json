    "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding \\( z(t) \\):**\n   - The function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) describes a unit circle in the complex plane.\n   - This is because \\( e^{it} = \\cos(t) + i\\sin(t) \\), which parametrizes the unit circle as \\( t \\) varies from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation \\( T(z) \\):**\n   - The transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(s) \\, ds \\) integrates the function \\( z(s) \\) from 0 to \\( t \\).\n   - Substituting \\( z(s) = e^{is} \\) into the integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{is} \\, ds\n     \\]\n   - To solve this integral, we use the antiderivative of \\( e^{is} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int e^{is} \\, ds = \\frac{e^{is}}{i} + C\n     \\]\n   - Evaluating this from 0 to \\( t \\):\n     \\[\n     T(z) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{is}}{i} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{e^{it}}{i} - \\frac{e^{i \\cdot 0}}{i} = \\frac{e^{it}}{i} - \\frac{1}{i} = \\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   - Using Euler's formula, we know that \\( e^{it} = \\cos(t) + i\\sin(t) \\).\n   - Therefore,\n     \\[\n     T(z) = \\frac{\\cos(t) + i\\sin(t) - 1}{i} = \\frac{-1 + \\cos(t) + i\\sin(t)}{i} = -i(-1 + \\cos(t)) + \\sin(t)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying further:\n     \\[\n     T(z) = \\sin(t) - i(1 - \\cos(t))\n     \\]\n\n4. **Reversing the Transformation:**\n   - We need to determine if we can deduce \\( z(t) \\) from \\( T(z) \\) without additional information.\n   - From the expression \\( T(z) = \\sin(t) - i(1 - \\cos(t)) \\), we see that it is a complex function of \\( t \\).\n   - However, knowing \\( T(z) \\) at a specific time \\( T \\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) for all \\( t \\). The integral transformation loses the phase information of the original function \\( z(t) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional information about the initial conditions or the specific form of \\( z(t) \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) from \\( T(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To analyze the effect of the integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(s) ds \\) on the system described by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Define the System and Transformation:**\n   - The system is given by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which represents a unit circle in the complex plane.\n   - The transformation \\( T(z) \\) integrates \\( z(s) \\) from 0 to \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Transformation:**\n   - We need to compute \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{is} ds \\).\n   - The integral of \\( e^{is} \\) with respect to \\( s \\) is \\( \\frac{e^{is}}{i} + C \\), where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration. Since we are integrating from 0 to \\( t \\), we can ignore the constant \\( C \\) as it will cancel out when evaluating the definite integral.\n   - Evaluating the definite integral:\n     \\[\n     T(z) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{is}}{i} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{e^{it}}{i} - \\frac{e^{i \\cdot 0}}{i} = \\frac{e^{it}}{i} - \\frac{1}{i} = \\frac{e^{it} - 1}{i}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Analyze the Output of \\( T(z) \\):**\n   - The output of \\( T(z) \\) at time \\( T \\) is \\( \\frac{e^{iT} - 1}{i} \\).\n   - This expression depends on \\( T \\) but does not retain the periodic nature of \\( e^{it} \\). It provides an accumulation of the contributions of \\( e^{is} \\) over the interval \\([0, T]\\).\n\n4. **Deduce the Original Function \\( z(t) \\):**\n   - To determine if we can deduce the original function \\( z(t) \\) from the output of \\( T(z) \\), consider that \\( T(z) \\) is an integral transformation that loses information about the phase and frequency of \\( z(t) \\).\n   - Specifically, \\( T(z) \\) gives us a complex number that represents the accumulated effect of \\( e^{is} \\) over time, but it does not preserve the specific periodicity or the exact form of \\( e^{it} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional information about the specific form of \\( z(t) \\), it is not possible to uniquely deduce \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) solely from the output of \\( T(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
