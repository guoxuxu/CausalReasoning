    "To determine if the final state of \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is solely dependent on \\( \\omega \\), we need to analyze the effect of the transformation \\( R(z) = Bz \\) on \\( z(t) \\).\n\n1. **Initial State**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the state of \\( z \\) is \\( z(t_1) = e^{i \\omega t_1} \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the transformation \\( R(z) = Bz \\) is applied. This means that the new state becomes \\( z(t_1^+) = Bz(t_1) = Be^{i \\omega t_1} \\).\n\n3. **Subsequent Evolution**: After the transformation, \\( z(t) \\) continues to evolve according to its original form \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\). However, since the initial condition at \\( t_1 \\) has changed to \\( Be^{i \\omega t_1} \\), the evolution will be:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{i \\omega (t - t_1)} \\cdot Be^{i \\omega t_1} = Be^{i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n   This shows that the subsequent evolution is now scaled by \\( B \\).\n\n4. **Final State at Time \\( T \\)**: For \\( T > t_1 \\), the state of \\( z \\) at time \\( T \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = Be^{i \\omega (T - t_1)} e^{i \\omega t_1} = Be^{i \\omega T}\n   \\]\n\nFrom the above steps, it is clear that the final state of \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends not only on \\( \\omega \\) but also on the matrix \\( B \\). Therefore, the answer is no, the final state is not solely dependent on \\( \\omega \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
