    "To determine if we can uniquely trace back whether the sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t)\\) was applied at \\(t = 0\\) from observing the total charge \\(Q(t)\\) at some time \\(t = T\\), let's analyze the system step-by-step:\n\n1. **System Description**: The system is an LC circuit with resistance \\(R\\) (an RLC circuit).

Specifically, the initial charge and current will be determined by the state of the circuit just before the application of the voltage. However, once the voltage is applied, the response will follow the same general form due to linearity.\n\n5. **Observation at Time \\(T\\)**: At any time \\(T > 0\\), the charge \\(Q(T)\\) will depend on the initial conditions at \\(t = 0\\) and the history of the voltage application.

Specifically, the initial current and charge will be influenced by the sine wave at \\(t = 0\\), whereas they would not be if the source is applied at a later time.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that by examining the charge \\(Q(t)\\) at a specific time \\(t = T\\), we can indeed distinguish whether the sinusoidal voltage source was applied at \\(t = 0\\) or at a later time.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can uniquely trace back whether the sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t)\\) was applied at \\(t = 0\\) from observing the total charge \\(Q(t)\\) at some time \\(t = T\\), let's analyze the system step-by-step.\n\n1. **System Description**: The system is an LC oscillator with a resistor, described by the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   L \\ddot{Q} + R \\dot{Q} + \\frac{Q}{C} = V(t)\n   \\]\n   where \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\).\n\n2. **Initial Conditions and Response**: The response of the system to a sinusoidal input depends on the initial conditions (charge and current at \\(t = 0\\)) and the frequency of the input relative to the natural frequency of the LC circuit. For a sinusoidal input \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\), the steady-state solution will be another sinusoidal function of the same frequency but with a phase shift and amplitude that depend on the parameters \\(L\\), \\(C\\), \\(R\\), and the initial conditions.\n\n3. **Effect of Applying Voltage at Different Times**:\n   - If \\(V(t)\\) is applied at \\(t = 0\\), the system starts oscillating immediately.\n   - If \\(V(t)\\) is applied at some later time \\(t = t_0 > 0\\), the system will start oscillating with a phase shift due to the transient response caused by the delayed application of the voltage.\n\n4. **Observation at \\(t = T\\)**:\n   - The charge \\(Q(T)\\) at time \\(T\\) will be influenced by the initial conditions and the history of the input \\(V(t)\\).\n   - However, the exact form of \\(Q(T)\\) does not uniquely determine when the voltage was applied because the system's response to a delayed input at \\(t = t_0\\) will still result in a sinusoidal charge variation with a phase shift, which might be similar to the response if the voltage had been applied at \\(t = 0\\) but with a different phase.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without additional information about the initial conditions or the specific time delay, it is impossible to uniquely determine whether the sinusoidal voltage source was applied at \\(t = 0\\) just by observing \\(Q(T)\\) at some later time \\(T\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
