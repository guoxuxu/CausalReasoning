Therefore, the primary frequency components cannot be solely determined by \\(x(t)\\) alone; they also depend on \\(y(t)\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct response is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real functions.\n\n2. **Intervention**: At time \\( t = 0 \\), we add a periodic function \\( s(t) = \\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\) to \\( x(t) \\). This means \\( x(t) \\) is now modified to \\( x'(t) = x(t) + \\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\).\n\n3. **New Complex Function**: With the modification, the new complex function becomes:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = x'(t) + iy(t) = (x(t) + \\cos(\\omega_1 t)) + iy(t)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( z'(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}'(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{z'(t)\\}\n   \\]\n   Using linearity of the Fourier transform, we can split it into:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}'(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t) + \\cos(\\omega_1 t)\\} + i\\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}'(\\omega) = \\hat{x}(\\omega) + \\frac{\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_1) + \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_1)}{2} + i\\hat{y}(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{x}(\\omega) \\) and \\( \\hat{y}(\\omega) \\) are the Fourier transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), respectively, and the term \\( \\frac{\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_1) + \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_1)}{2} \\) represents the contribution from the cosine function.\n\n5. **Primary Frequency Components**: The primary frequency components of \\( \\hat{z}'(\\omega) \\) include those from both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), as well as the additional frequency component from \\( \\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since \\( \\hat{z}'(\\omega) \\) includes contributions from \\( x(t) \\), \\( y(t) \\), and the new frequency component due to \\( \\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\), the primary frequency components are not solely determined by \\( x(t) \\) and not influenced by \\( y(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "To determine if the primary frequency components in the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) will be solely determined by \\(x(t)\\) after adding the periodic function \\(s(t) = \\cos(\\omega_1 t)\\) to \\(x(t)\\) at \\(t = 0\\), let's reason through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial System**: Initially, \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\). The Fourier transform \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) of \\(z(t)\\) will contain frequency components from both \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\).\n\n2. **Intervention**: At \\(t = 0\\), \\(s(t) = \\cos(\\omega_1 t)\\) is added to \\(x(t)\\). This means that \\(x(t)\\) changes to \\(x(t) + \\cos(\\omega_1 t)\\) only at \\(t = 0\\). For all other times, \\(x(t)\\) remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Impact**: The Fourier transform \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) of the new \\(z(t)\\) will reflect the change in \\(x(t)\\) due to the addition of \\(\\cos(\\omega_1 t)\\) at \\(t = 0\\). Specifically, the Fourier transform of \\(\\cos(\\omega_1 t)\\) is a pair of impulses at \\(\\pm \\omega_1\\).\n\n4. **Primary Frequency Components**: The primary frequency component introduced by \\(\\cos(\\omega_1 t)\\) will appear in the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) as impulses at \\(\\pm \\omega_1\\). These impulses are a direct result of the intervention on \\(x(t)\\) and do not affect the frequency components of \\(y(t)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) is now influenced by the impulse at \\(\\omega_1\\) (from the intervention on \\(x(t)\\)), and the original frequency components from \\(y(t)\\) remain unchanged, the primary frequency components in \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) will indeed be primarily determined by the change in \\(x(t)\\) due to the intervention, not by \\(y(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **System Description**: We have a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are the real and imaginary components, respectively.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\) of \\( z(t) \\) gives us information about the frequency components of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention**: At time \\( t = 0 \\), we add a periodic function \\( s(t) = \\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\) to \\( x(t) \\). This means \\( x(t) \\) becomes \\( x(t) + \\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\) after the intervention.\n\n4. **Effect on \\( z(t) \\)**: Since \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), the addition of \\( \\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\) to \\( x(t) \\) directly affects \\( z(t) \\) as \\( z(t) \\) now includes the cosine term in its real part.\n\n5. **Fourier Transform of the New \\( z(t) \\)**: The Fourier transform \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\) of the new \\( z(t) \\) will include the frequency components from both \\( x(t) + \\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\). Specifically, the cosine term \\( \\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\) will introduce a peak at \\( \\omega = \\omega_1 \\) and possibly at \\( \\omega = -\\omega_1 \\) in the frequency domain.\n\n6. **Primary Frequency Components**: The primary frequency components of the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{z}(\\omega) \\) will be influenced by both the original \\( x(t) \\) and the newly introduced \\( \\cos(\\omega_1 t) \\). The component due to \\( y(t) \\) will also be present but will not be directly affected by the intervention.\n\nGiven these steps, the resulting spectrum's primary frequency components will not be solely determined by \\( x(t) \\) and will include contributions from \\( y(t) \\) as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
