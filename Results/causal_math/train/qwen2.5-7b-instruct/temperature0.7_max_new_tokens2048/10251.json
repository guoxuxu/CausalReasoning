    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original System**: The original system is described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\). This means that the evolution of \\(z(t)\\) is governed solely by the matrix \\(M\\).\n\n2. **Transformation with \\(R(t)\\)**: The transformation \\(g(z) = R(t)z\\) where \\(R(t) = e^{iNt}\\) changes the form of \\(z(t)\\) but does not alter the underlying dynamics governed by \\(M\\).

This transformation modifies \\(z(t)\\) from \\(t_1\\) onwards. The effect of this transformation can be seen by considering how it interacts with the original dynamics.\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**: To determine if the final state \\(z(T)\\) (for \\(T > t_1\\)) is solely determined by \\(M\\) and independent of \\(N\\) and \\(Q\\), we need to consider the combined effect of both transformations over the interval \\([t_1, T]\\).\n\n5. **Combined Transformation**: Before \\(t_1\\), the system evolves under \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\). At \\(t_1\\), the transformation \\(h(z) = e^{iQt}z\\) starts affecting the system.

The presence of \\(N\\) affects the initial state before \\(t_1\\) and thus indirectly influences \\(z(T)\\) through its effect on \\(z(t_1)\\).\n\nTherefore, the final state \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) is not solely determined by \\(M\\) and is dependent on \\(Q\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
