    "To determine whether we can conclusively determine the initial state \\( z_0 \\) of the function \\( z(t) \\) just by observing its Fourier Transform at some time \\( T \\), let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation**: The given differential equation is \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).
