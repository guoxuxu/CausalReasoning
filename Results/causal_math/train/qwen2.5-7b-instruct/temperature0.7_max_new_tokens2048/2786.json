    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\).\n   - \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are solutions to linear differential equations with constant matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) respectively.\n   - We are given the Laplace transforms \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\) of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Properties:**\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\) is \\( X(s) \\), which can be written as:\n     \\[\n     X(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, for \\( y(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     Y(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} y(t) dt\n     \\]\n\n3. **Initial Conditions:**\n   - The initial conditions for \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\) respectively.\n   - For the Laplace transform, the initial conditions appear as:\n     \\[\n     X(s) = x_0 \\cdot \\frac{s}{s - \\lambda}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     Y(s) = y_0 \\cdot \\frac{s}{s - \\mu}\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( \\mu \\) are eigenvalues of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) respectively.\n\n4. **Reversing the Laplace Transform:**\n   - To find \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\), we need to reverse the Laplace transform.\n   - For \\( X(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     X(s) = x_0 \\cdot \\frac{s}{s - \\lambda}\n     \\]\n     As \\( s \\to 0 \\), the term \\( \\frac{s}{s - \\lambda} \\to 1 \\). Therefore:\n     \\[\n     x_0 = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sX(s)\n     \\]\n   - Similarly, for \\( Y(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     Y(s) = y_0 \\cdot \\frac{s}{s - \\mu}\n     \\]\n     As \\( s \\to 0 \\), the term \\( \\frac{s}{s - \\mu} \\to 1 \\). Therefore:\n     \\[\n     y_0 = \\lim_{s \\to 0} sY(s)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since we can uniquely determine \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\) from \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\) using the limits as \\( s \\to 0 \\), it is indeed possible to uniquely determine the initial vectors \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\) solely from \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the initial vectors \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\) can be uniquely determined from \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\), let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Differential Equations and Initial Conditions**:\n   - We have \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\).\n   - The Laplace transforms of these differential equations are:\n     \\[\n     sX(s) - x_0 = AX(s)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     sY(s) - y_0 = BY(s)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solving for Initial Conditions**:\n   - Rearrange the equations to solve for \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\):\n     \\[\n     x_0 = X(s)(sI - A)^{-1}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     y_0 = Y(s)(sI - B)^{-1}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( I \\) is the identity matrix. Since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant matrices, \\( (sI - A) \\) and \\( (sI - B) \\) are also matrices that depend on \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Uniqueness of Solution**:\n   - For \\( x_0 \\) to be uniquely determined from \\( X(s) \\), the matrix \\( (sI - A)^{-1} \\) must exist and be unique for all \\( s \\). Similarly, for \\( y_0 \\) to be uniquely determined from \\( Y(s) \\), the matrix \\( (sI - B)^{-1} \\) must exist and be unique for all \\( s \\).\n   - Assuming \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are such that \\( sI - A \\) and \\( sI - B \\) are invertible for all \\( s \\) (which is generally true for stable systems), the inverses \\( (sI - A)^{-1} \\) and \\( (sI - B)^{-1} \\) are unique.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the above conditions, we can uniquely determine \\( x_0 \\) and \\( y_0 \\) from \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\) respectively.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
