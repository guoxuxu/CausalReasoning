    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Function**: The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\).

This suggests there might be additional components or interventions affecting the system.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Intervention**: The term \\( \\frac{1}{s + 1} \\) in the transformed function could suggest an additional component of the form \\( e^{-t} \\) in the time domain due to the inverse Laplace transform properties. However, this alone does not conclusively indicate that the system experienced the specific intervention \\( z(t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\).\n\n5. **Specific Intervention**: To decisively conclude whether the system experienced the specific intervention \\( z(t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\), we would need to see if the term \\( \\frac{1}{s + 1} \\) directly corresponds to \\( e^{-t} \\) and if it appears at the exact moment \\( t_1 \\). Without more information about the system's behavior at \\( t_1 \\), we cannot conclusively state that the system experienced this intervention.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the information provided, we cannot decisively conclude whether the system experienced the specific intervention \\( z(t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\) just from the transformed function.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

However, the given transformed function is \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i} + \\frac{1}{s + 1} \\).

    "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine if we can conclusively decide whether the system experienced the specific intervention \\( z(t_1) = e^{-t_1} \\).\n\n1. **Understand the Original System**:\n   - The original system is described by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which represents a rotating phasor in the complex plane with angular frequency 1 radian per unit time.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of the Original System**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) would be \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i} \\).
