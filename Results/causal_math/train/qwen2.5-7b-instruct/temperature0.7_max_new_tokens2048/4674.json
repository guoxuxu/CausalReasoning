    "To determine if we can infer the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) from the Fourier transform \\( F(x(T)) \\) at \\( t = T \\), let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **System Dynamics**: The system is described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t) \\). This is a linear homogeneous system with a constant matrix \\( M \\).\n\n2. **Solution Form**: The solution to this differential equation is \\( x(t) = e^{Mt}x(0) \\), where \\( x(0) \\) is the initial condition at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transformation**: The Fourier transform \\( F(x(t)) \\) is defined as \\( F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\).\n\n4. **Transforming the Solution**: Applying the Fourier transform to the solution \\( x(t) = e^{Mt}x(0) \\):\n   \\[\n   F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{Mt}x(0)e^{-i\\omega t} dt = x(0) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(M - i\\omega)t} dt.\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( M - i\\omega \\) is a complex number whose real part is the eigenvalue of \\( M \\) (since \\( M \\) is a constant matrix, it has eigenvalues which are constants).\n\n5. **Inverting the Fourier Transform**: To find \\( x(0) \\) from \\( F(x(T)) \\), we need to invert the Fourier transform. However, the integral above converges only under specific conditions on \\( M \\) and \\( \\omega \\). If \\( M \\) has negative real parts for all its eigenvalues, then the integral converges, and the inverse Fourier transform exists.\n\n6. **Recovering Initial Condition**: Given \\( F(x(T)) \\), we can use the inverse Fourier transform to recover \\( x(T) \\). Then, using the known form of the solution \\( x(t) = e^{Mt}x(0) \\), we can solve for \\( x(0) \\) by applying \\( e^{-MT} \\) to \\( x(T) \\).\n\nGiven these steps, we can indeed infer the original vector \\( x_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) from the Fourier transform \\( F(x(T)) \\) at \\( t = T \\), provided that the matrix \\( M \\) has appropriate properties (negative real parts for its eigenvalues).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
