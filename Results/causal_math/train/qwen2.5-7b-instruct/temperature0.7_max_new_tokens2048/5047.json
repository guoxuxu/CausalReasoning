    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Matrix Diagonalization**: Initially, we have a matrix \\( A \\) which can be diagonalized if it has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors. This means there exists a matrix \\( P \\) whose columns are the eigenvectors of \\( A \\), such that:\n   \\[\n   P^{-1}AP = D\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( D \\) is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of \\( A \\) on its diagonal.\n\n2. **Effect of External Matrix Q**: An external matrix \\( Q \\) then modifies \\( D \\) to form another matrix \\( B \\):\n   \\[\n   B = Q^{-1}DQ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Eigenvalues of Modified Matrix**: To determine the eigenvalues of \\( B \\), we need to consider the characteristic polynomial of \\( B \\). The characteristic polynomial of a matrix \\( M \\) is given by \\( \\det(M - \\lambda I) \\).\n\n4. **Eigenvalue Calculation for \\( B \\)**: For \\( B = Q^{-1}DQ \\), the characteristic polynomial is:\n   \\[\n   \\det(B - \\lambda I) = \\det(Q^{-1}DQ - \\lambda I)\n   \\]\n   Using properties of determinants, this can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   \\det(Q^{-1}(D - \\lambda I)Q)\n   \\]\n   Since the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\det(Q^{-1})\\det(D - \\lambda I)\\det(Q)\n   \\]\n   Because \\( \\det(Q^{-1}) = (\\det(Q))^{-1} \\), these terms cancel out, leaving us with:\n   \\[\n   \\det(D - \\lambda I)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The characteristic polynomial of \\( B \\) is identical to that of \\( D \\), which means the eigenvalues of \\( B \\) are the same as those of \\( D \\). Since \\( D \\) is derived from \\( A \\) through diagonalization, the eigenvalues of \\( D \\) are the same as those of \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, the resultant matrix \\( B \\) will indeed have the same eigenvalues as the initial matrix \\( A \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
