    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Time-Scaling Operation**:\n   - We have a function \\( f(t) \\).\n   - The time-scaling operation \\( g(t) = f(\\alpha t) \\) scales the argument of the function by a factor of \\( \\alpha \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of \\( f(t) \\)**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) is given by \\( L(f)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of \\( g(t) \\)**:\n   - We need to find \\( L(g)(s) \\), which is \\( L(f(\\alpha t))(s) \\).\n   - Substitute \\( g(t) = f(\\alpha t) \\) into the Laplace transform formula:\n     \\[\n     L(f(\\alpha t))(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(\\alpha t) dt.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Change of Variables**:\n   - To simplify the integral, let \\( u = \\alpha t \\). Then \\( du = \\alpha dt \\) and \\( dt = \\frac{du}{\\alpha} \\).\n   - When \\( t = 0 \\), \\( u = 0 \\); when \\( t \\to \\infty \\), \\( u \\to \\infty \\).\n   - Substitute these into the integral:\n     \\[\n     L(f(\\alpha t))(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-su/\\alpha} f(u) \\frac{du}{\\alpha}.\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the expression:\n     \\[\n     L(f(\\alpha t))(s) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-su/\\alpha} f(u) du.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Recognizing the Integral**:\n   - The integral \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-su/\\alpha} f(u) du \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( f(u) \\) with a substitution of \\( s \\) by \\( \\frac{s}{\\alpha} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^\\infty e^{-su/\\alpha} f(u) du = L(f)(\\frac{s}{\\alpha}).\n     \\]\n\n6. **Final Expression for Laplace Transform of \\( g(t) \\)**:\n   - Therefore,\n     \\[\n     L(f(\\alpha t))(s) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} L(f)(\\frac{s}{\\alpha}).\n     \\]\n\n7. **Comparison**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) = f(\\alpha t) \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} L(f)(\\frac{s}{\\alpha}) \\).\n   - This is different from the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\), which is \\( L(f)(s) \\).\n\nBased on the above steps, we can conclude that applying the time-scaling operation \\( g(t) = f(\\alpha t) \\) and then computing its Laplace Transform does indeed change the result compared to directly computing the transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
