    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, recall that the Laplace transform of a function \\(z(t)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[ Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\]\n\n2. For our specific function \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\), we need to compute its Laplace transform:\n   \\[ Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} dt \\]\n   \\[ Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{t(i\\omega - s)} dt \\]\n\n3.
