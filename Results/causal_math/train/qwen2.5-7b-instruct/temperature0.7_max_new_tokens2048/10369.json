    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Initial Function and Transformation**:\n   - We start with the function \\( h(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\).\n   - The integral transformation we use is \\( H(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt \\).\n\n2. **Applying \\( f(t) = t^2 \\)**:\n   - If we apply \\( f(t) = t^2 \\) to \\( h(t) \\), the new function becomes \\( f(h(t)) = (t^2)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{t^2} \\).\n\n3. **Transformation with the New Function**:\n   - Now, we need to transform \\( \\frac{1}{t^2} \\) through the same integral transformation.\n   - This gives us a new function \\( H_f(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} \\frac{1}{t^2} dt \\).\n\n4. **Direct Transformation Without Applying \\( f(t) \\)**:\n   - Directly transforming \\( h(t) = \\frac{1}{t} \\) through the integral transformation gives us \\( H(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} \\frac{1}{t} dt \\).\n\n5. **Comparing the Two Transformations**:\n   - To compare \\( H_f(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\), we need to evaluate both integrals.\n   - For \\( H(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     H(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} \\frac{1}{t} dt\n     \\]\n     This integral diverges for all \\( s \\neq 0 \\) because the integrand does not decay fast enough near \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n   - For \\( H_f(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     H_f(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} \\frac{1}{t^2} dt\n     \\]\n     This integral also diverges for all \\( s \\neq 0 \\) but for different reasons. The integrand \\( \\frac{e^{-st}}{t^2} \\) decays faster than \\( \\frac{1}{t} \\) but still does not converge at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both integrals diverge similarly, meaning that the application of \\( f(t) = t^2 \\) does not significantly change the nature of divergence compared to the original transformation.\n   - Therefore, the functional forms of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( H_f(s) \\) do not change significantly in terms of their divergence properties.\n\nBased on the above reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
