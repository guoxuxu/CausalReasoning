This follows from the time-shifting property of the Laplace Transform, which states that if \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\} = H(s) \\), then \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at}h(t)\\} = H(s-a) \\).\n\n3. **Analyzing \\( H(s-a) \\)**: The expression \\( H(s-a) \\) is the Laplace Transform of the system response after it has been modified by the convolution with \\( g(t) \\).
