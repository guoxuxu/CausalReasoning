Importantly, no additional modifications (like the multiplication by \\( s \\) mentioned in the problem statement) are applied to \\( G(s) \\) before performing the inverse Laplace transform.\n\nThe key point here is that the inverse Laplace transform of \\( G(s) \\) should, in theory, perfectly recover the original function \\( g(t) \\) if no changes were made to \\( G(s) \\) after its initial transformation.\n\nTherefore, the resultant signal \\( f(t) \\) obtained from \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\} \\) will indeed be identical to the original signal \\( g(t) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal and Transformation**:\n   - We start with a signal \\( g(t) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is \\( G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\).\n\n2. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - Applying the inverse Laplace transform to \\( G(s) \\) gives us \\( f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\} \\).\n   - By definition, the inverse Laplace transform of \\( G(s) \\) should return the original signal \\( g(t) \\).\n\n3. **Multiplication in the Complex Domain**:\n   - Consider the modified function \\( H(s) = sG(s) \\).\n   - This multiplication represents a differentiation in the time domain (by the frequency-domain shifting property of Laplace transforms).\n\n4. **Effect on the Original Signal**:\n   - If we apply the inverse Laplace transform to \\( H(s) \\) without any further modifications, we get:\n     \\[\n     h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{sG(s)\\}\n     \\]\n   - According to the properties of the Laplace transform, multiplying by \\( s \\) corresponds to taking the derivative of \\( g(t) \\) in the time domain:\n     \\[\n     h(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}g(t)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If we only apply the inverse Laplace transform to \\( G(s) \\) without any additional modifications, the result would be \\( g(t) \\) itself.\n   - However, if there is a multiplication by \\( s \\) before the inverse transform, the result would be the derivative of \\( g(t) \\).\n\nGiven that the problem statement specifies applying the inverse Laplace transform without additional modifications, the resultant signal \\( f(t) \\) should be identical to the original signal \\( g(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
