    "To answer this question, let's break down the information and reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\) describes how temperature \\(u(x, t)\\) changes over time \\(t\\) within a rod. Here, \\(k\\) is the thermal diffusivity, a property of the material that depends on its thermal conductivity, density, and specific heat capacity.\n\n2. **Boundary Conditions**: Boundary conditions are crucial for solving partial differential equations like the heat equation. They specify the behavior of the solution at the boundaries of the domain. In this case, the step function \\(\\phi(x) = T\\) (a constant temperature) is applied at one end of the rod.\n\n3. **Impact of Boundary Condition**: If the boundary condition \\(\\phi(x) = T\\) is applied at \\(x = 0\\), it means the temperature at \\(x = 0\\) is fixed to \\(T\\) for all times \\(t\\).
