This modification is local, meaning it affects only the value of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\) and possibly nearby points due to the nature of differentiability.\n\n3. **Application of Differential Operator \\( D \\)**: The differential operator \\( D \\) is applied to \\( z(t) + w(t) \\), resulting in \\( D(z(t) + w(t)) = z'(t) + w'(t) \\).
