    "Let's analyze the system step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The system starts with \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Intervention**: At time \\( t = t_1 \\), an intervention \\( h(z) = e^{-\\alpha t}z \\) is applied. This means that at time \\( t_1 \\), the state of the system changes from \\( z(t_1) \\) to \\( h(z(t_1)) \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Intervention**: The new state after the intervention at \\( t = t_1 \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   z(t_1^+) = e^{-\\alpha t_1} z(t_1) = e^{-\\alpha t_1} e^{i\\omega t_1} z_0 = e^{i\\omega t_1 - \\alpha t_1} z_0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Post-Intervention Dynamics**: After the intervention, the system continues to evolve according to its original dynamics, but starting from the new state \\( z(t_1^+) \\). Therefore, for \\( t > t_1 \\), the state of the system is given by:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{i\\omega (t - t_1)} z(t_1^+)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( z(t_1^+) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{i\\omega (t - t_1)} e^{i\\omega t_1 - \\alpha t_1} z_0 = e^{i\\omega t - \\alpha t_1} z_0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final State at Time \\( T \\)**: To find the state of the system at time \\( T \\) (\\( T > t_1 \\)):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i\\omega T - \\alpha t_1} z_0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**: The final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\alpha \\) through the term \\( e^{i\\omega T - \\alpha t_1} \\). Specifically, it includes the factor \\( e^{-\\alpha t_1} \\), which is influenced by \\( \\alpha \\).\n\nBased on this analysis, the system at time \\( T \\) does depend on \\( \\alpha \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
