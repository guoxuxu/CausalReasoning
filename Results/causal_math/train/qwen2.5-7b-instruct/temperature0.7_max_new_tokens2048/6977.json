    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: At \\( t = 0 \\), we have some initial function \\( z(t_0) \\).

Therefore, the frequency spectrum at any later time \\( t = T \\) is still accurately represented by \\( F(z) \\), just with a phase shift.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z \\). This is a first-order linear differential equation, which has the general solution:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   where \\( A \\) is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform at t = 0**:\n   Applying the Fourier transform \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) to \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A dt\n   \\]\n   Since \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\) and evaluating it at \\( t = 0 \\) gives \\( A \\), the Fourier transform simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = A \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function and \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the frequency parameter.\n\n3. **Evolution of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves as \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\). At any later time \\( t = T \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = A e^{i\\omega T}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourier Transform at t = T**:\n   Now, apply the Fourier transform to \\( z(T) \\):\n   \\[\n   F(z(T))(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(T) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A e^{i\\omega T} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = A e^{i\\omega T} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega (t-T)} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral is again a Dirac delta function shifted by \\( \\omega T \\):\n   \\[\n   F(z(T))(\\omega) = A e^{i\\omega T} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The Fourier transform of \\( z(T) \\) is indeed \\( A e^{i\\omega T} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), which means the frequency spectrum is still accurately represented by \\( F(z) \\) but scaled by \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}, because the frequency spectrum of \\( z(t) \\) at any later time \\( t = T \\) is still accurately represented by \\( F(z) \\), just scaled by the phase factor \\( e^{i\\omega T} \\)."
