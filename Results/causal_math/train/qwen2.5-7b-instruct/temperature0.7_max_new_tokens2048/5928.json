Here, \\(L\\) is a linear operator acting on the function \\(u\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) converts the PDE into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the frequency domain. If we denote the Fourier transform of \\(u(t)\\) as \\(\\hat{u}(\\omega, t)\\), then the transformed equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathcal{F}(L)(\\hat{u}) = 0\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\mathcal{F}(L)\\) represents the Fourier transform of the operator \\(L\\).\n\n3. **Interventions and Operator Changes**: Suppose at some time \\(t_0 < T\\), the operator \\(L\\) is changed to \\(M\\). This means for \\(t > t_0\\), the PDE becomes \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + M(u) = 0\\).\n\n4. **Effect of Fourier Transform**: When applying the Fourier transform, if \\(L\\) is replaced by \\(M\\) at \\(t = t_0\\), the corresponding ODE will change from \\(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathcal{F}(L)(\\hat{u}) = 0\\) to \\(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathcal{F}(M)(\\hat{u}) = 0\\) for \\(t > t_0\\).\n\n5. **Determining Interventions**: Given only the function at time \\(T\\) (after any possible changes in \\(L\\) to \\(M\\)), it is not straightforward to determine the exact moment \\(t_0\\) when the operator was changed. The final state at \\(T\\) would depend on the entire history of the system, including how the operator evolved over time.\n\n6. **Non-uniqueness Issue**: Without additional information about the initial conditions or the specific forms of \\(L\\) and \\(M\\), the same final state could result from different sequences of operator changes.
