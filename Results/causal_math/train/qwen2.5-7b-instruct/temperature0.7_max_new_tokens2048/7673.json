So, after some time \\( T \\), the state becomes:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z_0 e^{\\alpha T}\n   \\]\n   This means that the state has been scaled by \\( e^{\\alpha T} \\).\n\n5. **Comparison**: We need to compare \\( z(T) \\) after the transformation with what \\( z_0 \\) would have evolved to if it had not been transformed.
