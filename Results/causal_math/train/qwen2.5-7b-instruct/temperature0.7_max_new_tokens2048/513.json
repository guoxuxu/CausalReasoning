    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal Transformation**:\n   - The initial signal is \\( x(t) = e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\).\n   - Applying the Fourier Transform to \\( x(t) \\) gives \\( X(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function. This indicates that all the energy of the signal is concentrated at frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\).\n\n2. **Modulation**:\n   - The signal \\( X(\\omega) \\) is then modulated by \\( g(\\omega) = e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|} \\).\n   - This results in \\( X(\\omega) \\cdot g(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\cdot e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|} \\).\n\n3. **Properties of Modulation**:\n   - The modulation function \\( g(\\omega) \\) is zero for \\( \\omega \\neq \\omega_0 \\) and has a peak at \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\).\n   - However, due to the Dirac delta function, the product \\( X(\\omega) \\cdot g(\\omega) \\) still retains the property that it is non-zero only at \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\).\n\n4. **Resultant Signal**:\n   - Since \\( g(\\omega) \\) is effectively zero everywhere except at \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\), the modulation does not change the fact that the energy is concentrated at \\( \\omega_0 \\).\n   - Therefore, the resultant signal \\( \\text{Resultant}(\\omega) \\) will still have all its energy concentrated at \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\).\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - If we compare \\( \\text{Resultant}(\\omega) \\) at any frequency \\( \\omega \\neq \\omega_0 \\), it will be zero (since the Dirac delta function is zero away from its peak).\n   - The original Fourier Transform \\( X(\\omega) \\) would also be zero at these frequencies.\n   - However, at \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\), both \\( X(\\omega) \\) and \\( \\text{Resultant}(\\omega) \\) will have non-zero values, but they are not identical because the original \\( X(\\omega) \\) is a single impulse while \\( \\text{Resultant}(\\omega) \\) is a modulated version of this impulse.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the resultant signal at \\( \\omega \\) will not match the signal as if the original \\( x(t) \\) was transformed at that frequency without modulation, except at \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal Transformation**:\n   - The time-dependent signal is \\( x(t) = e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\).\n   - Applying the Fourier Transform to \\( x(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     X(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega_0 t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\).\n\n2. **Modulation**:\n   - The modulation function is \\( g(\\omega) = e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|} \\).\n   - The modulated signal in the frequency domain is:\n     \\[\n     X(\\omega) \\cdot g(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\cdot e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|}\n     \\]\n     This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     X(\\omega) \\cdot g(\\omega) = 2\\pi e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evolution in Frequency Domain**:\n   - If no further intervention occurs, the modulated signal remains unchanged:\n     \\[\n     X(\\omega) \\cdot g(\\omega) = 2\\pi e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Resultant Signal**:\n   - The resultant signal after modulation and evolution is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Resultant}(\\omega) = 2\\pi e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - To determine if the resultant signal matches the signal as if the original \\( x(t) \\) was transformed without modulation, we need to compare it with the original Fourier Transform of \\( x(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     X(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n     \\]\n   - Clearly, the resultant signal \\( \\text{Resultant}(\\omega) = 2\\pi e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\) is not identical to \\( X(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\) because of the additional exponential factor \\( e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|} \\).\n\nTherefore, the resultant signal does not match the signal as if the original \\( x(t) \\) was transformed without modulation.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
