Specifically, the Fourier transform of \\( e^{-\\alpha (t - t_1)} \\) itself is a Lorentzian function centered at zero frequency, indicating the presence of the damping effect.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The Fourier transform of the modified \\( z(t) \\) will reflect not only the natural frequency \\( \\omega \\) but also the influence of the damping term \\( \\alpha \\). Therefore, the resulting function cannot be said to reflect only the changes due to \\( \\omega \\) without influence from \\( \\alpha \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) is composed of two harmonic oscillators \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), each governed by the equation \\( \\ddot{x} = -\\omega^2 x \\) and \\( \\ddot{y} = -\\omega^2 y \\).\n\n2. **Damping Term Introduction**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a damping term \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) is introduced into \\( z(t) \\). This means the new function becomes \\( z(t) = (x(t) + iy(t))e^{-\\alpha t} \\) for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Application**: The Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) will convert \\( z(t) \\) into its frequency domain representation. For a damped harmonic oscillator, the Fourier transform will include the effects of both the natural frequency \\( \\omega \\) and the damping coefficient \\( \\alpha \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Damping on Fourier Transform**: When applying the Fourier transform to the damped function \\( z(t)e^{-\\alpha t} \\), the transform will reflect not just the natural frequency \\( \\omega \\), but also the damping effect \\( \\alpha \\). The Fourier transform of a damped sinusoid includes a shift in the frequency domain that reflects the damping factor.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the Fourier transform of the modified function \\( z(t)e^{-\\alpha t} \\) will indeed show the influence of both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\alpha \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct output is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
