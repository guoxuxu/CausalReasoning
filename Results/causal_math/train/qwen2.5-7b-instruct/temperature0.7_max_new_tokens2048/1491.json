The initial intervention \\( h(z) = z^m \\) (which was applied at \\( t_1 \\)) does not affect the dependence on \\( w \\) in the final expression for \\( z(T) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The resultant point \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) indeed depends solely on the parameter \\( w \\) and not on \\( k \\) or \\( m \\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's analyze the transformations step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with \\( z(t) = e^{iwt} \\). This represents a point on the unit circle in the complex plane that rotates with angular frequency \\( w \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( g(z) = z^k \\)**: Applying \\( g(z) \\) to \\( z(t) \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   g(z(t)) = (e^{iwt})^k = e^{ikwt}\n   \\]\n   This transformation scales the angular frequency by \\( k \\), so the point still lies on the unit circle but now rotates \\( k \\) times faster than before.\n\n3. **Transformation \\( h(z) = z^m \\)**: Applying \\( h(z) \\) to \\( z(t) \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   h(z(t)) = (e^{iwt})^m = e^{imwt}\n   \\]\n   Similarly, this transformation scales the angular frequency by \\( m \\), making the point rotate \\( m \\) times faster.\n\n4. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: If we apply \\( h(z) \\) at a specific time \\( t_1 \\), the new state of \\( z \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   z(t_1) = e^{iwt_1}\n   \\]\n   Then applying \\( h(z) \\) to \\( z(t_1) \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   h(z(t_1)) = (e^{iwt_1})^m = e^{imwt_1}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Subsequent Evolution**: After the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the subsequent evolution of \\( z \\) is governed by \\( g(z) \\) starting from the new state \\( e^{imwt_1} \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = (e^{imwt_1})^k = e^{ikmwt_1}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Final Point Analysis**: The final point \\( z(T) \\) after the intervention and subsequent evolution can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{ikmwt_1}\n   \\]\n   This expression depends on both \\( w \\), \\( k \\), and \\( m \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the resultant point \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does indeed depend on both \\( k \\) and \\( m \\) because these parameters scale the angular frequency of rotation after the intervention.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
