    "To determine if the initial current \\( I_0 \\) can be recovered precisely from the output signal \\( I'(T) \\) without knowledge of the transformation \\( L \\), let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation \\( L \\) is described as a linear operator that performs an integral transformation on the current signal \\( I(t) \\). This means that \\( I'(t) = L[I(t)] \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   I'(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(t, \\tau) I(\\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   where \\( K(t, \\tau) \\) is the kernel of the integral transformation.\n\n2. **Inverse Problem**: To recover \\( I(t) \\) from \\( I'(t) \\), one would typically need to invert the transformation \\( L \\). This would require knowledge of the kernel \\( K(t, \\tau) \\).\n\n3. **Lack of Kernel Information**: Since the problem states that we do not know the transformation \\( L \\) (i.e., we don't have information about the kernel \\( K(t, \\tau) \\)), we cannot directly invert the transformation to recover \\( I(t) \\).\n\n4. **Precision of Recovery**: Even if we had some form of \\( I'(T) \\) at a specific time \\( T \\), without the complete knowledge of the transformation, we cannot uniquely determine the initial condition \\( I_0 \\). This is because the transformation could map multiple different initial signals to the same output signal due to the nature of integral transformations.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
