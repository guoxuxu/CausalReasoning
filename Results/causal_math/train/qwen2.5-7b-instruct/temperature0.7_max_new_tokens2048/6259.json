    "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine if the final state of \\( Z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends solely on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) and not on \\( \\mathcal{T} \\).\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real-valued functions of time.\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( \\mathcal{L} \\)**: The operator \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) performs a Laplace transform on \\( z(t) \\). The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-st} \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (x(t) + iy(t)) e^{-st} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This results in a complex function \\( Z(s) \\) in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Introduction of New Function \\( w(t) \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( w(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) is introduced. However, the problem does not specify how this function affects the system. For simplicity, let's assume it only starts contributing after \\( t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Transformation by \\( \\mathcal{T} \\)**: Another transformation \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) is applied, which is an integral transform different from the Laplace transform. Let's denote the result of applying \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) to \\( z(t) \\) as \\( Z_{\\mathcal{T}}(s) \\).\n\n5. **Final State Analysis**:\n   - The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) of \\( z(t) \\) up to time \\( t_1 \\) is \\( Z(s) \\).\n   - If \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) operates on \\( z(t) \\) but does not affect the part of \\( z(t) \\) that is before \\( t_1 \\), then for \\( T > t_1 \\), the effect of \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) should be minimal because it might only modify the part starting from \\( t_1 \\).\n   - The primary concern is whether the final state \\( Z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is influenced by \\( \\mathcal{T} \\).\n\nGiven the above points, we need to consider the nature of \\( \\mathcal{T} \\). Since \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) is an integral transform, its effect would generally be cumulative over the entire interval. However, the problem specifies that the focus is on the state for \\( T > t_1 \\). If \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) is such that it does not significantly alter the state for \\( T > t_1 \\) beyond what the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) already captures, then the state \\( Z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) can be considered dependent primarily on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\).\n\nHowever, without more specific details about \\( \\mathcal{T} \\), it's challenging to definitively state that \\( Z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is entirely independent of \\( \\mathcal{T} \\). But based on the typical behavior of integral transforms and the given context, we can infer that the influence of \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) is likely to be minimal for \\( T > t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThis is because \\( \\mathcal{T} \\) could potentially have an impact on the state \\( Z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\), even if it is minor.",
