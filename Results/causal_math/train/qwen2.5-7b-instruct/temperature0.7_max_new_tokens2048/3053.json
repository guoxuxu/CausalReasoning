At \\(t=0\\), \\(f(0) = 1\\), so the rates are not changed at the start. However, after scaling, the new rates become:\n   \\[\n   \\lambda' = \\lambda e^{\\alpha t}, \\quad \\mu' = \\mu e^{\\alpha t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transition Rate Matrix Post-Scaling**:\n   The scaled transition rate matrix \\(Q'\\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   Q' = \\begin{bmatrix}\n   -\\lambda e^{\\alpha t} & \\lambda e^{\\alpha t} \\\\\n   \\mu e^{\\alpha t} & -\\mu e^{\\alpha t}\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Behavior Over Time**:\n   If we allow the scaled transition rates to evolve over time under the original Markov process, the rates would change dynamically according to \\(f(t)\\). However, the question asks what happens if the scaling is only applied at \\(t=0\\) and then the system evolves under the original rates without further intervention.\n\n5. **Effect on Probability**:\n   Since the scaling function \\(f(t)\\) is only applied at \\(t=0\\) and not subsequently, the transition rates revert to their original values \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\mu\\) for \\(t > 0\\). Thus, the evolution of the Markov chain post-scaling does not introduce any additional scaling but rather returns to the original rates.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   The probability of being in state 2 at time \\(T\\) should be the same as if no scaling was applied because the system reverts to its original rates after the initial scaling.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThis is because the initial scaling by \\(f(t)\\) does change the transition rates at \\(t=0\\), but the problem specifies that the system evolves under the original rates after this initial scaling.
