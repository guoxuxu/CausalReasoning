    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial System Behavior**: The system is initially modeled by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} x(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) satisfies the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\). This means that \\( x(t) \\) is an eigenfunction of the linear system with eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\) such that \\( \\dot{x} = \\lambda x \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( x(t) \\)**: Since \\( x(t) \\) is a solution to a linear differential equation, it can be expressed as a sum of exponential functions (if the system is stable and the initial conditions allow). The Fourier transform of \\( x(t) \\) will be a function of frequency, reflecting the spectrum of \\( x(t) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention Introduction**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a time-varying phase shift \\( e^{i\\delta t} \\) is introduced. This means that for \\( t > t_1 \\), the function \\( z(t) \\) becomes \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} x(t) e^{i\\delta (t - t_1)} \\).\n\n4. **Effect on \\( z(t) \\)**: The introduction of the phase shift \\( e^{i\\delta (t - t_1)} \\) modifies the phase of \\( z(t) \\) but does not change the frequency component \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\). The term \\( e^{i\\delta (t - t_1)} \\) introduces a linear phase shift in the time domain, which corresponds to a frequency shift in the frequency domain.\n\n5. **Fourier Transform Analysis**: When we take the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) after the intervention, the Fourier transform will include a term involving \\( e^{-i\\delta t_1} \\) due to the phase shift at \\( t_1 \\). This term affects the phase of the Fourier transform but does not alter the frequency content.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) will still primarily depend on \\( \\omega \\) but will also include a phase shift due to the introduction of \\( e^{i\\delta (t - t_1)} \\). Therefore, the Fourier transform will not solely depend on \\( \\omega \\) and will also depend on \\( \\delta \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
