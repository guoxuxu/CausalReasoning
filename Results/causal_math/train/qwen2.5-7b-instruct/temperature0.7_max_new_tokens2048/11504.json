Here, \\( f(z) \\) is the function that is transformed by the integrand.\n\n3. **Considering \\( g(z) \\)**: If there were another function \\( g(z) \\) involved, it would appear in the integral as \\( \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{g(z)}{z - z_0} dz \\).\n\n4. **Analyzing the Given Information**: The problem statement provides only one integral expression involving \\( f(z) \\). There is no information about \\( g(z) \\) or any other function in the given context.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the provided information, we can only determine the function \\( f(z) \\) from the integral expression \\( \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{f(z)}{z - z_0} dz \\). Since there is no mention of \\( g(z) \\) or any other function in the given context, we cannot determine if \\( g(z) \\) was also part of the original problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
