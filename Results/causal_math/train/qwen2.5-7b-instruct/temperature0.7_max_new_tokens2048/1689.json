This indicates that \\( g(t) \\) is an exponentially decaying function, i.e., \\( g(t) = g(0)e^{-\\lambda t} \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( g(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) is given by \\( \\mathcal{F}[g](f) \\). For the initial condition, this can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[g(0)](f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(0)e^{-i2\\pi ft} dt\n   \\]\n   Since \\( g(t) = g(0)e^{-\\lambda t} \\), the Fourier transform evolves as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[g(t)](f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(0)e^{-\\lambda t}e^{-i2\\pi ft} dt = g(0)\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(\\lambda + i2\\pi f)t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[g(t)](f) = \\frac{g(0)}{\\lambda + i2\\pi f}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evolution Over Time**: The function \\( g(t) \\) evolves according to its differential equation. Therefore, the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[g(t)](f) \\) also evolves, but the form remains similar due to the linearity of the Fourier transform and the fact that the differential equation is linear.\n\n4. **Additional Transformation**: An additional transformation \\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\) is applied to the Fourier transform. This modifies the Fourier transform as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[g(t)](f) \\cdot h(f) = \\frac{g(0)}{\\lambda + i2\\pi f} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha |f|^2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final State at Time \\( T \\)**: At time \\( T \\), the Fourier transform is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[g(T)](f) = \\frac{g(0)}{\\lambda + i2\\pi f} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha |f|^2}\n   \\]\n   The magnitude of this expression at time \\( T \\) is:\n   \\[\n   |\\mathcal{F}[g(T)](f)| = \\left| \\frac{g(0)}{\\lambda + i2\\pi f} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\right| = \\frac{|g(0)|}{|\\lambda + i2\\pi f|} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha |f|^2}\n   \\]\n   The term \\( \\frac{1}{|\\lambda + i2\\pi f|} \\) is a phase shift and scaling factor, but it does not change the overall shape of the function when multiplied by \\( e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The shape of \\( \\mathcal{F}[g(T)](f) \\) is modified by the additional transformation \\( h(f) \\), but it retains the initial exponential decay structure in the frequency domain. The magnitude \\( |\\mathcal{F}[g(T)](f)| \\) will have the same qualitative behavior as the original Fourier transform, scaled and shifted by the additional Gaussian term.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"} because the shape of \\( | \\mathcal{F}[g(T)](f) | \\) will retain the initial Fourier transform's structure, modified by the additional Gaussian term.",
    "To determine if \\( |F[g](f, T)| \\) retains its initial shape after evolving according to the given differential equation, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The function \\( g(t) \\) is described by the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dt}g(t) = -\\lambda g(t) \\). This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with the general solution:\n   \\[\n   g(t) = g(0) e^{-\\lambda t}\n   \\]\n   where \\( g(0) \\) is the initial value of \\( g(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) to \\( g(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   F[g](f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(t) e^{-2\\pi i f t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(0) e^{-\\lambda t} e^{-2\\pi i f t} dt\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Fourier transform, we get:\n   \\[\n   F[g](f) = g(0) \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + 2\\pi i f / \\lambda}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evolution Over Time**: If \\( g(t) \\) evolves according to its differential equation without further manipulations, the function remains \\( g(t) = g(0) e^{-\\lambda t} \\). Therefore, the Fourier transform of \\( g(t) \\) at any time \\( T \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   F[g](f, T) = g(0) \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + 2\\pi i f / \\lambda} \\cdot e^{-\\lambda T}\n   \\]\n   Taking the absolute value:\n   \\[\n   |F[g](f, T)| = \\left| g(0) \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + 2\\pi i f / \\lambda} \\cdot e^{-\\lambda T} \\right| = \\left| g(0) \\right| \\cdot \\left| \\frac{1}{1 + 2\\pi i f / \\lambda} \\right| \\cdot e^{-\\lambda T}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\left| \\frac{1}{1 + 2\\pi i f / \\lambda} \\right| = 1 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   |F[g](f, T)| = |g(0)| \\cdot e^{-\\lambda T}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Effect of Additional Transformation**: The additional transformation \\( h(f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\) modifies the Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   F[h \\cdot g](f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\cdot F[g](f)\n   \\]\n   At \\( t = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   F[h \\cdot g](f) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\cdot \\frac{g(0)}{1 + 2\\pi i f / \\lambda}\n   \\]\n   At time \\( T \\):\n   \\[\n   F[h \\cdot g](f, T) = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\cdot \\frac{g(0)}{1 + 2\\pi i f / \\lambda} \\cdot e^{-\\lambda T}\n   \\]\n   Taking the absolute value:\n   \\[\n   |F[h \\cdot g](f, T)| = \\left| e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\cdot \\frac{g(0)}{1 + 2\\pi i f / \\lambda} \\cdot e^{-\\lambda T} \\right| = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\cdot \\left| \\frac{g(0)}{1 + 2\\pi i f / \\lambda} \\right| \\cdot e^{-\\lambda T}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\left| \\frac{g(0)}{1 + 2\\pi i f / \\lambda} \\right| = \\frac{|g(0)|}{\\sqrt{(1 + 2\\pi f / \\lambda)^2}} \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   |F[h \\cdot g](f, T)| = e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\cdot \\frac{|g(0)|}{\\sqrt{(1 + 2\\pi f / \\lambda)^2}} \\cdot e^{-\\lambda T}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The initial shape of \\( |F[g](f, T)| \\) is modified by the factor \\( e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\) due to the additional transformation \\( h(f) \\). Therefore, \\( |F[g](f, T)| \\) does not retain its initial shape without the modification by \\( e^{-\\alpha |f|^2} \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\": \"No\"}"
