Therefore, the Fourier transform of the damped function is:\n   \\[ \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = 2 \\pi \\frac{1}{\\alpha - i (\\omega - \\xi)} \\]\n\n6. This result shows that the transform is no longer a simple Dirac delta function but a Lorentzian-like function centered around \\( \\xi = \\omega \\).\n\n7.

Instead, the transform has a broader distribution centered around \\( \\xi = \\omega \\) but with significant decay for \\( |\\xi| \\neq \\omega \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   While the peak is still centered around \\( \\xi = \\omega \\), the presence of the damping factor \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) spreads out the energy of the transform, meaning it does not \"peak\" sharply at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\) in the same way as without the damping.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), which is a complex exponential with frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Applying Damping Factor**: When we apply the damping factor \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) to \\( z(t) \\), the new function becomes:\n   \\[\n   z_d(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} e^{i \\omega t} = e^{(-\\alpha + i \\omega)t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of the Damped Function**: The Fourier transform of \\( z_d(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z_d)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\xi t} e^{(-\\alpha + i \\omega)t} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(-\\alpha + i (\\omega - \\xi))t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluating the Integral**: This integral is a standard form of the Fourier transform of an exponentially decaying function.

However, it does not have a single peak at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\) but rather has a broad distribution centered around \\( \\xi = \\omega \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The presence of the damping factor \\( e^{-\\alpha t} \\) causes the Fourier transform to spread out, and it no longer primarily peaks at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "To determine whether the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi)\\) will still primarily peak at \\(\\xi = \\omega\\) after applying the damping factor \\(e^{-\\alpha t}\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the modified function**: The original function is \\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\).
