    "To determine if we can reconstruct the exact original function \\(z(t)\\) from its Fourier Transform \\(F(z)\\), let's consider the properties and theorems related to Fourier Transforms.\n\n1. **Definition and Linearity**: The Fourier Transform \\(F(z)\\) is a linear operation, meaning that for any two functions \\(z_1(t)\\) and \\(z_2(t)\\) with their respective Fourier Transforms \\(F(z_1)\\) and \\(F(z_2)\\), and any constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the Fourier Transform of \\(az_1(t) + bz_2(t)\\) is \\(aF(z_1) + bF(z_2)\\).\n\n2. **Inversion Theorem**: The Inversion Theorem states that if \\(F(z)\\) is the Fourier Transform of \\(z(t)\\), then \\(z(t)\\) can be recovered from \\(F(z)\\) using the inverse Fourier Transform:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n   provided certain conditions (like sufficient decay at infinity) are met.\n\n3. **Uniqueness**: The Fourier Transform is unique under reasonable conditions. This means that if two different functions have the same Fourier Transform, they must be identical almost everywhere (except possibly on a set of measure zero).\n\n4. **Information Loss**: If the conditions of the Inversion Theorem are satisfied, there is no loss of information when transforming back from \\(F(z)\\) to \\(z(t)\\). The original function can be reconstructed exactly.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that under appropriate conditions, the Fourier Transform \\(F(z)\\) allows us to reconstruct the exact original function \\(z(t)\\) without any loss of information.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To determine if we can reconstruct the exact original function \\(z(t)\\) from its Fourier Transform \\(F(z)\\) without any loss of information, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Fourier Transform**: The Fourier Transform of \\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [u(t) + iv(t)] e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n   This can be split into real and imaginary parts:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt + i \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} v(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To reconstruct \\(z(t)\\) from \\(F(z)\\), we use the Inverse Fourier Transform:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(z) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n\n3. **Reconstruction of Real and Imaginary Parts**:\n   - For the real part \\(u(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     u(t) = \\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(z) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\\right)\n     \\]\n   - For the imaginary part \\(v(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     v(t) = \\text{Im}\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(z) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\\right)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Lossless Reconstruction**: According to the theory of Fourier analysis, if \\(z(t)\\) is absolutely integrable (which is often assumed for well-behaved functions), then the Inverse Fourier Transform will exactly recover the original function \\(z(t)\\). This means that all the information about \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) is preserved in \\(F(z)\\).\n\nTherefore, with the appropriate conditions met (absolute integrability of \\(z(t)\\)), we can indeed reconstruct the exact original function \\(z(t)\\) without any loss of information.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Fourier Transform**: The Fourier Transform of a function \\(z(t)\\) gives us information about the frequency components present in the signal.

However, for general functions, if the original function is not band-limited, or if the sampling is insufficient, there could be aliasing and loss of information.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Assuming that the original function \\(z(t)\\) is sufficiently well-behaved and that we have enough data (i.e., a proper sampling of the Fourier Transform), we can indeed reconstruct the exact original function \\(z(t)\\) without any loss of information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

According to the theory of Fourier Transforms, under certain conditions (such as the function being absolutely integrable), the inverse Fourier Transform will indeed reconstruct the original function \\(z(t)\\) without any loss of information.\n\n4. **Conditions for Losslessness**: The conditions for lossless reconstruction include the function being square-integrable and satisfying other criteria such as being band-limited or having sufficient decay at infinity. However, in practice, if these conditions are met, the inverse transform will perfectly recover the original function.\n\nGiven that the problem does not specify any additional constraints or conditions that would violate the fundamental properties of the Fourier Transform, we can conclude that under normal circumstances, the original function \\(z(t)\\) can be reconstructed exactly from its Fourier Transform \\(F(z)\\) without any loss of information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the original function \\(z(t)\\) can be reconstructed exactly from its Fourier Transform \\(F(z)\\) without any loss of information, let's analyze the process step-by-step.\n\n1. **Fourier Transform Definition**: The Fourier Transform \\(F(z)\\) of the complex function \\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (u(t) + iv(t)) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n   This can be separated into real and imaginary parts:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt + i \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} v(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To reconstruct \\(z(t)\\) from \\(F(z)\\), we use the Inverse Fourier Transform:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(z) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(F(z)\\) back into the inverse transform:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau + i \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} v(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau \\right) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n\n3. **Reconstruction of \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\)**: Using the linearity of the integral, we can separate the reconstruction of \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   u(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau \\right) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   v(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} v(\\tau) e^{-i\\omega \\tau} d\\tau \\right) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n   \\]\n   These integrals are essentially the inverse Fourier Transforms of the Fourier Transforms of \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\), respectively.\n\n4. **Lossless Reconstruction**: According to the properties of the Fourier Transform, if \\(F(z)\\) is known exactly, then \\(z(t)\\) can be reconstructed exactly using the inverse Fourier Transform. This is because the Fourier Transform is a one-to-one mapping for functions that satisfy certain conditions (e.g., absolutely integrable functions). Therefore, no information is lost in the transformation process.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
