    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Its Fourier Transform**:\n   - The original function is \\( u(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n   - We need to find its Fourier transform \\( U(f_x, f_y) \\). For a 2D Gaussian function like this, the Fourier transform is also a Gaussian function with a similar form but scaled in frequency space.\n\n2. **Shift in Spatial Domain**:\n   - When we shift the function \\( u(x, y) \\) by a vector \\( v = (a, b) \\) to get \\( w(x, y) = u(x - a, y - b) \\), we are essentially translating the function in the spatial domain.\n   - According to the properties of Fourier transforms, translation in the spatial domain corresponds to a phase shift in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of the Shifted Function**:\n   - The Fourier transform of a shifted function \\( w(x, y) \\) is given by the formula:\n     \\[\n     W(f_x, f_y) = e^{-2\\pi i (af_x + bf_y)} U(f_x, f_y)\n     \\]\n   - This means that the Fourier transform \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\) is not just a simple shift of \\( U(f_x, f_y) \\) but includes an additional phase factor due to the translation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\) is not a simple shifted version of \\( U(f_x, f_y) \\) because of the phase factor introduced by the translation in the spatial domain.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function Transformation**:\n   - We start with \\( u(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2} \\).\n   - The function is then shifted by a vector \\( v = (a, b) \\) to produce \\( w(x, y) = u(x - a, y - b) = e^{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Basics**:\n   - The Fourier transform of a 2D function \\( u(x, y) \\) is given by \\( U(f_x, f_y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x, y) e^{-j2\\pi(f_x x + f_y y)} dx dy \\).\n   - For a shifted function \\( w(x, y) = u(x - a, y - b) \\), its Fourier transform \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\) can be derived using the shift property of Fourier transforms.\n\n3. **Shift Property of Fourier Transform**:\n   - The shift property states that if \\( u(x, y) \\) has a Fourier transform \\( U(f_x, f_y) \\), then \\( u(x - a, y - b) \\) has a Fourier transform \\( U(f_x, f_y) e^{-j2\\pi(a f_x + b f_y)} \\).\n   - This means that shifting a function in the spatial domain corresponds to multiplying its Fourier transform by a complex exponential in the frequency domain.\n\n4. **Applying the Shift Property**:\n   - Given \\( w(x, y) = u(x - a, y - b) \\), applying the shift property directly gives us \\( W(f_x, f_y) = U(f_x, f_y) e^{-j2\\pi(a f_x + b f_y)} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The result \\( W(f_x, f_y) = U(f_x, f_y) e^{-j2\\pi(a f_x + b f_y)} \\) shows that the Fourier transform \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\) is not just a simple shifted version of \\( U(f_x, f_y) \\). It includes an additional phase factor due to the shift.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Will \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\) be a simple shifted version of \\( U(f_x, f_y) \\) in the frequency domain?\" is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
