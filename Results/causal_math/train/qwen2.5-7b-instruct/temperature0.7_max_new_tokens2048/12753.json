    "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Original Integral**: The original integral is \\( I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\cos(tx) \\, dx \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: We apply the transformation \\( u = ax + b \\). This implies that \\( x = \\frac{u - b}{a} \\) and \\( dx = \\frac{du}{a} \\).\n\n3. **Substitute into the Integral**: Substituting these into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(\\frac{u - b}{a})^2} \\cos(t(\\frac{u - b}{a})) \\frac{du}{a}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the exponent and argument of cosine, we have:\n   \\[\n   I = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{(u - b)^2}{a^2}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{t(u - b)}{a}\\right) \\, du\n   \\]\n\n4. **Behavior Analysis**: The transformed integral is still of the form involving an exponential and a cosine function, but now with modified parameters. The key observation here is that the form of the integrand does not change fundamentally with respect to \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The integral \\( I \\) depends on the parameters of the integrand, but the specific values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) do not affect the overall behavior of the integral in a way that allows us to uniquely determine them from the outcome of the integral.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the integral \\( I \\) is a well-known Gaussian integral multiplied by a cosine term, its value is known to be \\( \\sqrt{\\pi} e^{-\\frac{t^2}{4}} \\), independent of the transformation parameters \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) (as long as \\( a \\neq 0 \\)). Therefore, we cannot deduce the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) by analyzing the outcome of the integral \\( I \\) after applying the transformation.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
