The application of \\( g(z) \\) at any time \\( t \\) before \\( T \\) would alter the state in a way that depends on both \\( S \\) and \\( D \\), making it impossible to backtrack to a single unique initial state \\( z_0 \\) just from the final state \\( z(T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
