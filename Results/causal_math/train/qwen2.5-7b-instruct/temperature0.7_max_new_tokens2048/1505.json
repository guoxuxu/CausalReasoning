    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition and System Evolution**: The system starts with an initial state \\( x_0 \\).

Hence, the output would still be \\( z(t) = C e^{Dt} x_0 \\).\n\n6. **Laplace Transform Comparison**: Since the output \\( z(t) \\) remains the same regardless of whether it is considered from the initial state or directly evolved, the Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) should also remain the same.
