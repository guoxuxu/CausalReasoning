    "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Convolution Theorem**: The Convolution Theorem states that the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their individual Laplace transforms. Mathematically, if \\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\), then:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{(x * h)(t)\\} = X(s)H(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( X(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) respectively.\n\n2. **Identify the Functions**: In this case, \\( h(t) = e^{-at} \\). The Laplace transform of \\( h(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{-at}\\} = \\frac{1}{s + a}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the Convolution Theorem**: According to the theorem, if we apply the convolution \\( x(t) * h(t) \\) and then take the Laplace transform, we get:\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = X(s)H(s) = X(s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s + a}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Direct Laplace Transform of the Convolved Signal**: If we were to directly apply the Laplace transform to the convolved signal \\( y(t) = (x * h)(t) \\), the result would be \\( Y(s) = X(s)H(s) \\).\n\n5. **Compare the Results**: From the above steps, we see that the Laplace transform of the convolved signal \\( y(t) \\) is indeed \\( Y(s) = X(s)H(s) \\). This is the same as the result we would get if we directly applied the Laplace transform to the original signal \\( x(t) \\) after the convolution operation.\n\nTherefore, the transformed result at \\( s \\) will be the same whether we first perform the convolution and then the Laplace transform, or directly apply the Laplace transform to the convolved signal.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
