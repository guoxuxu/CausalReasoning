    "To determine whether the value of the transformed function \\( g(z) \\) remains the same when the path encircles the origin compared to when it does not, we need to analyze the behavior of the integral transformation under such conditions.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The function \\( g(z) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( z(t) = t^n \\), so the transformation becomes:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^n \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Path Encircling the Origin**: When \\( w \\) (and hence \\( z(t) = w^t \\)) encircles the origin, we are considering a closed contour around the origin in the complex plane. This means \\( w \\) traces a curve that starts and ends at the same point but goes around the origin one or more times.\n\n3. **Effect of Encircling the Origin**: For \\( z(t) = w^t \\), when \\( w \\) encircles the origin, \\( w^t \\) also encircles the origin as \\( t \\) varies from 0 to infinity. This implies that \\( t^n \\) will change its argument multiple times as \\( t \\) increases, leading to a non-trivial winding around the origin.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Integral**: The integral \\( g(z) \\) involves integrating \\( e^{-st} t^n \\) over the interval from 0 to infinity. If \\( t^n \\) encircles the origin, the phase of \\( t^n \\) changes, which can affect the value of the integral.\n\n5. **Residue Theorem Application**: To rigorously analyze this, we can use the Residue Theorem. The integral \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^n \\, dt \\) can be extended into the complex plane using a contour that includes the positive real axis and a semicircle in the upper half-plane. If \\( s \\) is in the right half-plane (i.e., \\( \\Re(s) > 0 \\)), the integral converges. However, if \\( w \\) encircles the origin, the function \\( t^n \\) has a branch cut, and the integral may pick up residues from the poles introduced by this branch cut.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that \\( t^n \\) encircles the origin, the integral \\( g(z) \\) will generally change due to the non-trivial winding of \\( t^n \\) around the origin.

    "To address this question, we need to analyze how the transformation \\( g(z) \\) behaves when the path of integration encircles the origin.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**:\n   - The transformation is given by \\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\).\n   - Here, \\( z(t) = t^n \\), where \\( n \\) is a complex number.\n   - Therefore, \\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^n \\, dt \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Path Encircling the Origin**:\n   - If \\( w \\) (which is related to \\( t \\)) encircles the origin, it means \\( t \\) traces a closed curve around the origin in the complex plane.\n   - For \\( z(t) = t^n \\), the behavior around the origin depends on the value of \\( n \\).

    "To address this question, we need to carefully analyze the given transformations and their implications on the function \\( z(w) \\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function \\( z(w) = w^n \\) is a power function with a complex exponent \\( n \\). This function can be quite complex depending on the value of \\( n \\), especially when \\( n \\) is not an integer.\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\) involves integrating \\( z(t) \\) from 0 to infinity, weighted by \\( e^{-st} \\).

If \\( n \\) is not an integer, this change in argument will result in a different value for \\( z(w) \\).\n\n- **Not Encircling the Origin**:\n  - If \\( w \\) does not encircle the origin, then the argument of \\( w \\) does not change, and thus the argument of \\( z(w) \\) also does not change. In this case, \\( z(w) \\) remains the same.\n\n### Integral Transformation Impact:\n\n- The integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\) involves integrating \\( z(t) \\) along the real line from 0 to infinity. The behavior of \\( z(t) \\) as \\( t \\) varies does not directly depend on the path in the complex plane but rather on the values of \\( z(t) \\) at each point \\( t \\).\n- Since \\( z(w) = w^n \\) is a continuous function of \\( w \\), the integral transformation will yield the same result regardless of whether \\( w \\) encircles the origin or not, as long as the path of integration remains the same.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe value of the transformed function \\( g(z) \\) will not change if \\( w \\) encircles the origin because the integral transformation is evaluated along the real line from 0 to infinity, which does not depend on the path in the complex plane but rather on the values of \\( z(t) \\) at each point \\( t \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To determine whether the value of the transformed function \\( g(z) \\) remains the same when \\( w \\) encircles the origin compared to when it does not, we need to analyze the effect of the path on the integral transformation.\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral Transformation**:\n   - The transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\) involves integrating the function \\( z(t) \\) from 0 to \\(\\infty\\).\n   - Since \\( z(t) = t^n \\), we have \\( g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^n \\, dt \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Path Encircling the Origin**:\n   - When \\( w \\) (which is a parameter in \\( z(w) = w^n \\)) encircles the origin, it means that \\( w \\) traces a closed loop around the origin.\n   - For \\( z(w) = w^n \\), the exponent \\( n \\) being a complex number can lead to non-trivial behavior under path encirclement due to the multi-valued nature of complex exponentiation.\n\n3. **Path Independence and Cauchy's Integral Theorem**:\n   - If \\( g(z) \\) were independent of the path (i.e., path-independent), then the value of the integral would be the same regardless of whether \\( w \\) encircles the origin or not.\n   - However, for complex functions, particularly those involving multi-valued functions like \\( w^n \\), path independence is not guaranteed unless certain conditions are met (like the function being analytic everywhere except possibly at isolated singularities).\n\n4. **Effect of Encircling the Origin**:\n   - Encircling the origin with \\( w \\) in \\( z(w) = w^n \\) changes the argument of \\( w \\) by \\( 2\\pi \\) times the imaginary part of \\( n \\). This change affects the function \\( z(w) \\) and consequently the integrand \\( e^{-st} z(t) \\).\n   - Therefore, the value of the integral \\( g(z) \\) will generally change when \\( w \\) encircles the origin because the function \\( z(w) \\) itself changes along the path.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the value of \\( g(z) \\) changes when \\( w \\) encircles the origin, it does not remain the same as if the path did not encircle the origin.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
