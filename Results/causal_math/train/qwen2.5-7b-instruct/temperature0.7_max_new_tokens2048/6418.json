    "To determine if we can conclusively determine the original state \\( z(0) \\) given \\( z(T) \\) and the transformation matrix \\( M \\), let's reason through the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Transformation Description**: The transformation matrix \\( M \\) is given as:\n   \\[\n   M = \\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\\\ b & a \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n   This matrix represents a rotation by an angle \\( \\theta \\) and a scaling factor \\( r \\). Specifically, if \\( a = r \\cos(\\theta) \\) and \\( b = r \\sin(\\theta) \\), then \\( M \\) performs a rotation by \\( \\theta \\) and a scaling by \\( r \\).\n\n2. **Effect on Complex Numbers**: If \\( z(t) \\) is a complex number, the transformation can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = M z(0)\n   \\]\n   In matrix form, if \\( z(0) = \\begin{bmatrix} x(0) \\\\ y(0) \\end{bmatrix} \\), then:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = \\begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\\\ b & a \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x(0) \\\\ y(0) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} ax(0) - by(0) \\\\ bx(0) + ay(0) \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determining Original State**: To find \\( z(0) \\) from \\( z(T) \\), we need to reverse the transformation applied by \\( M \\). The inverse of \\( M \\) is:\n   \\[\n   M^{-1} = \\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2} \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( a^2 + b^2 = r^2 \\), the inverse simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   M^{-1} = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, to find \\( z(0) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(0) = M^{-1} z(T) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ -b & a \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x(T) \\\\ y(T) \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given \\( z(T) \\) and the transformation matrix \\( M \\), we can compute \\( z(0) \\) using the inverse transformation. Thus, we can conclusively determine the original state \\( z(0) \\) without needing additional information about whether the transformation was applied.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThe correct answer should be \"Yes\", because with the given information and the knowledge of the transformation matrix \\( M \\), we can indeed determine the original state \\( z(0) \\)."
