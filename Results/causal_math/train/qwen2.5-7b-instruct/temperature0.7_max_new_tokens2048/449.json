The task is to consider how the contour integral of \\( F \\) changes when the contour is deformed from a circle to an ellipse.\n\n2. **Contour Integral Basics**: For a single variable function \\( f(z) \\), the Cauchy integral theorem states that if \\( f(z) \\) is analytic inside and on a simple closed curve \\( C \\), then the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over \\( C \\) is zero. However, for multiple variables, the situation is more complex and doesn't directly apply in the same way.\n\n3. **Analyticity and Contours**: In higher dimensions (like our 2D case with \\( z_1 \\) and \\( z_2 \\)), the concept of analyticity becomes more nuanced. If \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\) is analytic everywhere except at isolated singularities (poles), the integral over any closed contour depends only on the residues at those poles, according to the residue theorem.\n\n4. **Deformation of Contour**: The key point here is whether the deformation affects the enclosed area or the poles. Since the problem specifies that the endpoints and the poles are unchanged, the only change is the shape of the contour (from a circle to an ellipse). This does not introduce new singularities or remove existing ones.\n\n5. **Jordan's Lemma and Homotopy**: In the context of complex analysis, Jordan's lemma can be used to show that the integral over a closed contour remains the same under homotopic deformations of the contour, provided no singularities are crossed during the deformation.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the endpoints and poles are unchanged, and assuming \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\) is analytic in the region bounded by both contours (circle and ellipse), the integral should remain unchanged under the deformation from a circle to an ellipse.\n\nTherefore, based on these considerations, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To determine whether the result of the contour integral remains unchanged when deforming a contour from a circle to an ellipse without changing the endpoints or enclosing any poles, let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Context**: The problem is about the effect of contour deformation on the value of a contour integral for a function \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\), where \\( z_1 \\) and \\( z_2 \\) are complex variables.\n\n2. **Key Theorem**: The key theorem here is Cauchy's Integral Theorem, which states that if a function is holomorphic (complex differentiable) in a simply connected domain, then the integral of the function over any closed path in that domain is zero. This theorem applies to functions of a single complex variable, but it can be extended to functions of multiple complex variables under certain conditions.\n\n3. **Conditions for Multiple Variables**: For a function \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\) of two complex variables, if \\( F \\) is holomorphic in a neighborhood of the region enclosed by the contour, then the integral of \\( F \\) over a closed contour depends only on the values of \\( F \\) within that region, not on the specific shape of the contour.\n\n4. **Deformation of Contour**: Deforming the contour from a circle to an ellipse without changing the endpoints or enclosing any poles means that the region enclosed by the contour remains the same. If \\( F \\) is holomorphic in this region, then by Cauchy's Generalized Integral Theorem (which extends Cauchy's Integral Theorem to multiple dimensions), the integral should remain unchanged.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the endpoints are not changed and no poles are enclosed, the integral of \\( F \\) over the contour should remain the same after the deformation, assuming \\( F \\) is holomorphic in the region enclosed by both contours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "To determine whether the result of the integral \\( \\int F(z_1, z_2) dz \\) remains unchanged when deforming the contour from a circle to an ellipse without changing the endpoints or enclosing any poles, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n- **Function**: \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\) is a multi-variable function with complex variables \\( z_1 \\) and \\( z_2 \\).\n- **Contour Deformation**: The contour is deformed from a circle to an ellipse.\n- **Endpoints**: The endpoints of the contour are not changed.\n- **Poles**: No poles are enclosed by the contour during the deformation.\n\n### Step 2: Cauchy's Integral Theorem\nCauchy's Integral Theorem states that if a function \\( f(z) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on a simple closed contour \\( C \\), then the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over \\( C \\) is zero:\n\\[ \\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = 0. \\]\n\nHowever, this theorem applies to single-variable functions. For multivariable functions like \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\), we need to consider more general principles.\n\n### Step 3: Generalization to Multivariable Functions\nFor multivariable functions, the concept of analyticity extends to being holomorphic in each variable separately. If \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\) is holomorphic in both \\( z_1 \\) and \\( z_2 \\) within the region bounded by the contour, the integral should still be well-behaved under smooth deformations of the contour.\n\n### Step 4: Homotopy Invariance\nThe key principle here is homotopy invariance.

Cauchy's Integral Theorem states that if a function is holomorphic in a simply connected domain containing a closed contour, then the integral of the function over that contour is zero.\n\n3. **Contour Deformation**: If a function is holomorphic inside and on a contour, and if the deformation of the contour does not cross any singularities (poles), then the value of the integral remains unchanged. This is a consequence of the homotopy invariance of the integral for holomorphic functions.\n\n4. **Circle to Ellipse**: A circle and an ellipse are both simple closed curves in the complex plane.
