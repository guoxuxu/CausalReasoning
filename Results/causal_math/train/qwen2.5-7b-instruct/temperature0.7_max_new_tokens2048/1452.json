    "To determine if we can pinpoint whether a plain or time-varying phase shift was implemented on \\( z(t) \\) during the Fourier transformation, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Original Function**: The function is \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\). This is a simple exponential function with a constant angular frequency of 1.\n\n2. **Fourier Transformation**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{it} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(t - \\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplification of the Integral**: Simplifying the exponent inside the integral:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(t - \\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral does not have a straightforward closed-form solution, but it is known that for a constant frequency function like \\( e^{it} \\), its Fourier transform results in a Dirac delta function centered at the frequency of the original signal. Specifically:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - 1)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n4. **Phase Shift Consideration**:\n   - A plain phase shift would involve multiplying \\( z(t) \\) by a constant phase factor, say \\( e^{i\\phi} \\). In this case, the function becomes \\( z(t) = e^{i(t + \\phi)} \\).\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(t + \\phi)} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = e^{i\\phi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(t - \\omega + \\phi)} dt = e^{i\\phi} 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - 1)\n     \\]\n     The Fourier transform would still be a Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega = 1 \\), but scaled by \\( e^{i\\phi} \\).\n\n   - A time-varying phase shift would involve a phase that changes with time, which would complicate the integral significantly. However, the key point is that any time-varying phase shift would introduce additional frequency components into the Fourier transform, deviating from the simple Dirac delta function form.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: If the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) results in a simple Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega = 1 \\), then no time-varying phase shift was applied. If the Fourier transform shows additional frequency components or a different form, then a time-varying phase shift was likely applied.\n\nGiven the information and the nature of the Fourier transform of a constant frequency function, we can conclude that a plain phase shift would result in a simple scaling of the Dirac delta function, while a time-varying phase shift would introduce additional complexity.\n\nTherefore, based on the given Fourier transformed outcome, we can indeed pinpoint whether a plain or time-varying phase shift was implemented on \\( z(t) \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\": \"Yes\"}"
