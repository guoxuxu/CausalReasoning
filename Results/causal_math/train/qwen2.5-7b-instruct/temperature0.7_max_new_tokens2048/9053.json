    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Convolution**: We start with the convolution \\( z(t) = (x * h)(t) \\), where \\( z(t) \\) is the result of convolving \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of Convolution**: The Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their Fourier transforms. That is, if \\( X(\\omega) \\) and \\( H(\\omega) \\) are the Fourier transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) respectively, then:\n   \\[\n   Z(\\omega) = X(\\omega)H(\\omega)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Modification of \\( x(t) \\)**: Now, we modify \\( x(t) \\) by multiplying it with \\( e^{at} \\). Let the new function be \\( x_{\\text{new}}(t) = x(t)e^{at} \\).\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of Modified Function**: The Fourier transform of \\( x_{\\text{new}}(t) \\) will be:\n   \\[\n   X_{\\text{new}}(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)e^{at}\\} = X(\\omega - a)\n   \\]\n   Here, the shift theorem of Fourier transforms is applied, which states that multiplying a function by \\( e^{iat} \\) results in a shift of its Fourier transform by \\( a \\) in the frequency domain.\n\n5. **New Convolution and Its Fourier Transform**: The new convolution is:\n   \\[\n   z_{\\text{new}}(t) = (x_{\\text{new}} * h)(t) = (x(t)e^{at} * h(t))\n   \\]\n   The Fourier transform of this new convolution will be:\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(\\omega) = X_{\\text{new}}(\\omega)H(\\omega) = X(\\omega - a)H(\\omega)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Comparison**: Comparing \\( Z(\\omega) \\) and \\( Z_{\\text{new}}(\\omega) \\):\n   \\[\n   Z(\\omega) = X(\\omega)H(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(\\omega) = X(\\omega - a)H(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   Clearly, \\( Z(\\omega) \\neq Z_{\\text{new}}(\\omega) \\) unless \\( a = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the modification of \\( x(t) \\) by multiplying it with \\( e^{at} \\) does indeed change the Fourier transform of the convolution \\( z(t) \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
