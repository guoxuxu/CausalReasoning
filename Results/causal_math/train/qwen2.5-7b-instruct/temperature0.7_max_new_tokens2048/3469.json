    "To address the question, let's break down the analysis into steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Contour Integral**: The contour integral \\(\\int_C f(z)\\, dz\\) involves integrating the function \\(f(z) = \\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1}\\) around a closed path \\(C\\) in the complex plane. This integral can be evaluated using techniques such as the residue theorem if the poles of the integrand lie within the contour.\n\n2. **Residue Theorem Application**: The function \\(f(z)\\) has poles at \\(z = \\pm i\\). Depending on the specific contour \\(C\\), these poles may or may not be enclosed. If they are enclosed, the value of the integral can be determined by summing the residues at these poles.\n\n3. **Effect of Parameter \\(a\\)**: The parameter \\(a\\) affects the exponential term \\(e^{az}\\). As \\(a\\) increases, the magnitude of \\(e^{az}\\) grows exponentially for \\(z\\) with positive imaginary parts and decays exponentially for \\(z\\) with negative imaginary parts. This means that the contribution of the integrand to the contour integral will be more pronounced in regions of the complex plane where \\(z\\) has a larger imaginary part.\n\n4. **Significance of Change**: Whether the increase in \\(a\\) leads to a \"significant\" change in the value of the contour integral depends on the specific contour \\(C\\) and its orientation relative to the poles. Generally, if the contour encloses both poles, the residues at \\(z = \\pm i\\) will contribute to the integral. Increasing \\(a\\) will generally increase the magnitude of the residues (since the exponential term grows or decays based on the imaginary part of \\(z\\)), which could lead to a significant change in the value of the integral.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without specifying the exact contour \\(C\\) and its orientation, we cannot definitively say whether the change is \"significant.\" However, in general, increasing \\(a\\) would affect the magnitude of the residues and thus likely change the value of the contour integral.\n\nGiven the general nature of the problem and the effect of \\(a\\) on the magnitude of the residues, we conclude that an increase in \\(a\\) does lead to a significant change in the value of the contour integral, assuming the poles are enclosed by \\(C\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

The only change is in the phase due to the oscillatory nature of \\(\\cos(a)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "To determine if increasing the parameter \\(a\\) in the function \\(f(z) = \\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1}\\) leads to a significant change in the value of the contour integral \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function and the integral under changes in \\(a\\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function \\(f(z) = \\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1}\\) has poles at \\(z = \\pm i\\). These poles do not depend on \\(a\\).\n\n2. **Contour Integration**: By the residue theorem, the value of the contour integral \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\) depends on the residues of \\(f(z)\\) at its poles inside the contour \\(C\\).\n\n3. **Residues Calculation**:\n   - The residues at \\(z = i\\) and \\(z = -i\\) are given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Res}(f, i) = \\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) \\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1} = \\frac{e^{ai}}{2i}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Res}(f, -i) = \\lim_{z \\to -i} (z + i) \\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1} = \\frac{e^{-ai}}{-2i}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Integral Value**:\n   - The value of the contour integral is:\n     \\[\n     \\int_C f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\left( \\text{Res}(f, i) + \\text{Res}(f, -i) \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the residues:\n     \\[\n     \\int_C f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\left( \\frac{e^{ai}}{2i} + \\frac{e^{-ai}}{-2i} \\right) = \\pi (e^{ai} - e^{-ai}) = \\pi 2i \\sin(a)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\int_C f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\sin(a)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Effect of Increasing \\(a\\)**: The value of the integral \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\) is directly proportional to \\(\\sin(a)\\). As \\(a\\) increases, \\(\\sin(a)\\) oscillates between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\), and its magnitude can be significant depending on the specific value of \\(a\\).\n\nGiven that the value of the integral \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\) is significantly affected by the value of \\(\\sin(a)\\), increasing \\(a\\) will indeed lead to a significant change in the value of the contour integral, provided \\(a\\) is not restricted to values where \\(\\sin(a)\\) remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if increasing the parameter \\(a\\) in the function \\(f(z) = \\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1}\\) significantly changes the value of the contour integral \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\), let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Contour Integral**: The integral \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\) involves a closed path \\(C\\) in the complex plane. By Cauchy's Residue Theorem, the value of this integral depends on the residues of \\(f(z)\\) at its poles inside the contour \\(C\\).\n\n2. **Poles of \\(f(z)\\)**: The function \\(f(z)\\) has poles at \\(z = \\pm i\\) (since \\(z^2 + 1 = 0\\) gives \\(z = \\pm i\\)). The residues of \\(f(z)\\) at these poles are given by:\n   - At \\(z = i\\): \\(\\text{Res}(f, i) = \\lim_{z \\to i} (z - i) \\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1} = \\frac{e^{ai}}{-2i} = -\\frac{e^{ai}}{2i}\\)\n   - At \\(z = -i\\): \\(\\text{Res}(f, -i) = \\lim_{z \\to -i} (z + i) \\frac{e^{az}}{z^2 + 1} = \\frac{e^{-ai}}{2i}\\)\n\n3. **Cauchy's Residue Theorem**: The value of the contour integral is the sum of the residues multiplied by \\(2\\pi i\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int_C f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\left( -\\frac{e^{ai}}{2i} + \\frac{e^{-ai}}{2i} \\right) = \\pi (e^{-ai} - e^{ai}) = -2\\pi \\sin(a)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Effect of Increasing \\(a\\)**: As \\(a\\) increases, the term \\(\\sin(a)\\) oscillates between \\(-1\\) and \\(1\\). Therefore, the value of the contour integral \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\) will oscillate between \\(-2\\pi\\) and \\(2\\pi\\). This means that the magnitude of the integral does not change with the sign of \\(a\\), but it does change in a bounded manner as \\(a\\) increases.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the integral's value is bounded and oscillatory, increasing \\(a\\) does not lead to a significant change in the value of the contour integral in the sense of a large-scale alteration. However, it does lead to a significant change in the specific numerical value due to the oscillatory nature of \\(\\sin(a)\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we conclude that increasing \\(a\\) does lead to a significant change in the value of the contour integral, albeit in a bounded and oscillatory manner.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
