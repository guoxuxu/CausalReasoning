    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\), where \\( a \\) is a complex constant.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Definition**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   L(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{at} dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{(a-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention at \\( t = t_1 \\)**: If we change \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) at time \\( t = t_1 \\), we need to consider the piecewise nature of the function after the intervention. For \\( t < t_1 \\), the function remains \\( e^{at} \\), and for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), it becomes \\( e^{bt} \\).\n\n4. **Splitting the Integral**: The Laplace transform can be split into two parts due to the intervention:\n   \\[\n   L(z)(s) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{(a-s)t} dt + \\int_{t_1}^\\infty e^{(b-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n5. **Evaluating Each Part**:\n   - For \\( 0 \\leq t < t_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^{t_1} e^{(a-s)t} dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(a-s)t}}{a-s} \\right]_0^{t_1} = \\frac{e^{(a-s)t_1} - 1}{a-s}\n     \\]\n   - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int_{t_1}^\\infty e^{(b-s)t} dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(b-s)t}}{b-s} \\right]_{t_1}^\\infty = \\frac{1}{s-b} \\quad (\\text{assuming } s > b)\n     \\]\n\n6. **Combining the Results**: Combining these results gives us the total Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   L(z)(s) = \\frac{e^{(a-s)t_1} - 1}{a-s} + \\frac{1}{s-b}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Dependency Analysis**: From the expression above, it is clear that the Laplace transform depends on both the initial value \\( a \\) and the new value \\( b \\).
