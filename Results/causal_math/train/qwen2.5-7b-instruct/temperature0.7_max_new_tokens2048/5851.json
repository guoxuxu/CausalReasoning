The Laplace transform of a time-shifted function \\( h(t-t_1)u(t-t_1) \\) (where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function) is \\( e^{-s t_1}H(s) \\).\n\n### Step 6: Final Laplace Transform\nThe final Laplace Transform \\( Y(s) \\) will be a combination of the effects of both \\( g(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\).
