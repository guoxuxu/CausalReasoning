Instead, it involves convolution in the frequency domain.\n   - Since \\( w(s) \\) and \\( z(s) \\) are not typical Laplace transforms of real functions, their presence introduces complexity that cannot be ignored.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that both \\( z(s) \\) and \\( w(s) \\) are complex exponentials, they do not directly correspond to real functions' Laplace transforms.
