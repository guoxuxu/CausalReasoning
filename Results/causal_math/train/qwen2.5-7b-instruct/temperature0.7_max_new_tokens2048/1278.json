Since \\( f(z) = e^z \\) is entire, it satisfies the conditions of Cauchy's theorem.\n\n3. **Given Information**: We are given that \\( \\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Implication for Singularities**: For a function to have a non-zero contour integral around a closed path, it must have at least one singularity enclosed by that path. This follows from the residue theorem, which states that the integral of a function around a closed path is equal to \\( 2\\pi i \\) times the sum of the residues of the function at all singular points inside the path.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that \\( f(z) = e^z \\) has no singularities anywhere in the complex plane, and the contour integral is zero, it means that the contour \\( C \\) does not enclose any singularities of \\( f(z) \\).
