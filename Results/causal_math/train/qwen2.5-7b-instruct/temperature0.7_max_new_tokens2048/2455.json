    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Pz \\), where \\( P \\) is a complex constant. This means that \\( z(t) \\) follows an exponential growth or decay pattern given by:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0)e^{Pt}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Transformation at \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a linear transformation \\( h(z) = Qz \\) is applied. This changes the state of \\( z \\) from \\( z(t_1) \\) to \\( h(z(t_1)) = Qz(t_1) \\).\n\n3. **Further Transformation at \\( t_1 \\)**: Immediately after the first transformation, another linear transformation \\( k(z) = Rz \\) is applied. This changes the state of \\( z \\) from \\( Qz(t_1) \\) to \\( k(Qz(t_1)) = R(Qz(t_1)) \\). Therefore, the state of \\( z \\) at \\( t_1 \\) becomes \\( RQz(t_1) \\).\n\n4. **Evolution After \\( t_1 \\)**: After the transformations at \\( t_1 \\), the system continues to evolve according to the original rule \\( \\dot{z} = Pz \\). Thus, from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, the evolution of \\( z \\) is governed by:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = RQz(t_1)e^{P(t-t_1)} \\quad \\text{for } t > t_1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Position at \\( T \\)**: To find the position of \\( z \\) at time \\( T \\) (\\( T > t_1 \\)), we substitute \\( t = T \\) into the above expression:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = RQz(t_1)e^{P(T-t_1)}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( z(t_1) \\) is the result of the transformation \\( h(z) = Qz \\), which is \\( Qz(0) \\). Therefore, substituting back, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = RQz(0)e^{P(T-t_1)}\n   \\]\n\nFrom the above derivation, it is clear that the final position \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( P \\) and the product of the matrices \\( R \\) and \\( Q \\). Hence, the final position is not solely dependent on \\( P \\) but also influenced by \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
