However, the given form involves \\(e^{az}\\), which complicates the direct inverse transform because the Laplace transform is typically defined for functions of time \\(t\\), not \\(z\\).\n\n4. **Assumptions and Simplifications**:\n   - If \\(z\\) is treated as a time variable in some context (which is a common assumption in such problems), then the transform would be valid.\n   - But since \\(z\\) is a complex variable in \\(f(z)\\), and \\(g(z)\\) is also a function of \\(z\\), we must consider whether the standard Laplace transform framework directly applies.\n\n5. **Reconstructing \\(g(z)\\)**:\n   - The inverse Laplace transform would ideally give us back \\(e^{az}g(z)\\), but we need to isolate \\(g(z)\\).\n   - Without additional information about \\(a\\) or specific forms of \\(F(s)\\) and \\(g(z)\\), it is generally not possible to uniquely determine \\(g(z)\\) just from \\(F(s)\\) alone due to the presence of \\(e^{az}\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the complexity and the form of the Laplace transform involving \\(e^{az}\\), it is not possible to definitively reconstruct \\(g(z)\\) solely from \\(F(s)\\) without further assumptions or additional information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can definitively reconstruct the function \\(g(z)\\) from \\(F(s)\\), let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Given Function and Transform**:\n   - The original function is \\(f(z) = z^2 + cz\\).\n   - The Laplace transform is defined as \\(F(s) = \\mathcal{L}(e^{az}g(z))(s)\\).\n\n2. **Understanding the Transform**:\n   - The Laplace transform of a function \\(h(z)\\) is given by \\(\\mathcal{L}(h(z))(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sz} h(z) dz\\).\n   - Here, \\(h(z) = e^{az}g(z)\\).\n\n3. **Reconstructing \\(g(z)\\)**:\n   - To find \\(g(z)\\) from \\(F(s)\\), we need to invert the Laplace transform.\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\(F(s)\\) would give us \\(e^{az}g(z)\\). That is, \\(\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(F(s))(z) = e^{az}g(z)\\).\n   - To isolate \\(g(z)\\), we would need to divide both sides by \\(e^{az}\\): \\(g(z) = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(F(s))(z)}{e^{az}}\\).\n\n4. **Assumptions and Constraints**:\n   - The problem states that no other transformations were applied besides \\(e^{az}\\). This means \\(F(s)\\) directly corresponds to the Laplace transform of \\(e^{az}g(z)\\).\n   - However, the inverse Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}^{-1}(F(s))(z)\\) gives us \\(e^{az}g(z)\\), not just \\(g(z)\\). Therefore, we need to divide by \\(e^{az}\\) to get \\(g(z)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If we know the form of \\(e^{az}g(z)\\) from \\(F(s)\\), then dividing by \\(e^{az}\\) should yield \\(g(z)\\) (assuming \\(e^{az}\\) is non-zero for all \\(z\\)).\n   - Thus, with the given information and under the assumption that \\(e^{az}\\) does not introduce any additional complexity (like zeros or poles that would complicate the division), we can definitively reconstruct \\(g(z)\\).\n\nBased on this reasoning:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
