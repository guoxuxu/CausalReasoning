    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition and Differential Equation**:\n   - The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\).\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), \\( z(0) = z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Function**:\n   - An external transformation is given by \\( f(z) = e^{wt}z \\), where \\( w \\) is a complex constant.\n   - Applying \\( f(z) \\) to \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) gives \\( f(z_0) = e^{w \\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0 \\). So, initially, no change occurs.\n\n3. **Evolution Under Differential Equation**:\n   - If we apply the transformation \\( f(z) \\) to \\( z_0 \\) and then allow it to evolve under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\), we get \\( z(t) = f(z_0)e^{it} \\).\n   - Simplifying, \\( z(t) = z_0e^{it} \\).\n\n4. **Direct Evolution**:\n   - If we start with \\( z_0 \\) and directly evolve it under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\), we get \\( z(t) = z_0e^{it} \\).\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - In both cases (applying the transformation and then evolving vs. directly evolving), the resulting function at time \\( t \\) is \\( z(t) = z_0e^{it} \\).\n\nTherefore, the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) under the given conditions will be the same whether we apply the transformation \\( f(z) \\) first and then let it evolve, or directly evolve from \\( z_0 \\) under the differential equation.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
