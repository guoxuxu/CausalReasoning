The additional term \\( i \\) shifts the endpoint of the integral.\n   - The integrand \\( e^{w^2} \\) is an entire function (analytic everywhere in the complex plane), but the integral itself depends on the path taken from 0 to the endpoint. In general, for non-trivial paths, the values of these integrals will differ unless the path is closed or special properties hold (which do not apply here).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Because the endpoints of the integrals are different (\\( z \\) vs. \\( z' = z + i \\)), the outcomes of \\( g(z) \\) and \\( g(z') \\) will generally be different.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
