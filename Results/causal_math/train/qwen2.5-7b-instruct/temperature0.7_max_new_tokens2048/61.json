It merely changes how these functions are represented.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The integration does not change the trajectories of \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) because the differential equations governing their evolution remain unchanged. The transformation only affects the representation of the functions, not their underlying dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Differential Equations:**\n   - The given differential equations are \\( \\dot{u} = au \\) and \\( \\dot{v} = bv \\).\n   - These are first-order linear differential equations.\n   - Their solutions are \\( u(t) = u_0 e^{at} \\) and \\( v(t) = v_0 e^{bt} \\), where \\( u_0 \\) and \\( v_0 \\) are initial conditions.\n\n2. **Applying the Integral Transformation:**\n   - The transformation applied is \\( T(z) = \\int e^{kt} z(t) dt \\).\n   - This transformation involves integrating the product of \\( z(t) \\) and \\( e^{kt} \\).\n\n3. **Effect of the Transformation on \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\):**\n   - Since \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), we can write:\n     \\[\n     T(z) = \\int e^{kt} (u(t) + iv(t)) dt = \\int e^{kt} u(t) dt + i \\int e^{kt} v(t) dt\n     \\]\n   - Let's denote these integrals as:\n     \\[\n     A(t) = \\int e^{kt} u(t) dt \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B(t) = \\int e^{kt} v(t) dt\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( T(z) = A(t) + iB(t) \\).\n\n4. **Trajectories of \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) Before and After Transformation:**\n   - Before applying \\( T(z) \\), the trajectories of \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are given by:\n     \\[\n     u(t) = u_0 e^{at} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v(t) = v_0 e^{bt}\n     \\]\n   - After applying \\( T(z) \\), the transformed functions are:\n     \\[\n     A(t) = \\int e^{kt} u_0 e^{at} dt = u_0 \\int e^{(k+a)t} dt = \\frac{u_0}{k+a} e^{(k+a)t} + C_1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     B(t) = \\int e^{kt} v_0 e^{bt} dt = v_0 \\int e^{(k+b)t} dt = \\frac{v_0}{k+b} e^{(k+b)t} + C_2\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) are constants of integration.\n\n5. **Comparing Trajectories:**\n   - The original trajectories \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are exponential functions with exponents \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   - The transformed functions \\( A(t) \\) and \\( B(t) \\) are also exponential functions but with different exponents \\( k+a \\) and \\( k+b \\).\n   - The constants \\( C_1 \\) and \\( C_2 \\) do not affect the form of the exponential growth/decay.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The integration changes the form of the exponential functions but does not fundamentally alter the nature of their trajectories. The new trajectories are still exponential but with modified growth rates.\n   - Therefore, the integration does change the specific form of the trajectories but not in a way that fundamentally alters their qualitative behavior.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
