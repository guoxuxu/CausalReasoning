    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Given Differential Equation**: \n   \\[ \\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\]\n   This is a first-order linear differential equation with a complex constant \\( P \\).\n\n2. **General Solution**:\n   The solution to this differential equation can be found using the integrating factor method or recognizing it as an exponential growth/decay problem. The general solution is:\n   \\[ z(t) = z(0)e^{Pt} \\]\n   where \\( z(0) \\) is the initial condition at \\( t=0 \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   Applying the Laplace transform to \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(0) e^{Pt} dt \\]\n   Simplifying the integrand:\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = z(0) \\int_0^\\infty e^{(P-s)t} dt \\]\n\n4. **Evaluating the Integral**:\n   The integral converges for \\( \\Re(P-s) < 0 \\) (i.e., \\( \\Re(s) > \\Re(P) \\)):\n   \\[ \\int_0^\\infty e^{(P-s)t} dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(P-s)t}}{P-s} \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{s-P} \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}(z(t)) = \\frac{z(0)}{s-P} \\]\n\n5. **Effect of the Transformation**:\n   After applying the Laplace transform, the function \\( z(t) \\) is transformed into \\( \\frac{z(0)}{s-P} \\).

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Given Differential Equation**: \n   \\[ \\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\]\n   This is a first-order linear differential equation with a complex constant \\( P \\).\n\n2. **General Solution**:\n   The general solution to this differential equation is:\n   \\[ z(t) = Ce^{Pt} \\]\n   where \\( C \\) is a complex constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n3. **Laplace Transform**:\n   The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t)dt \\]\n   Substituting \\( z(t) = Ce^{Pt} \\) into the Laplace transform:\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}Ce^{Pt}dt = C\\int_0^\\infty e^{(P-s)t}dt \\]\n\n4. **Evaluating the Integral**:\n   The integral converges if the real part of \\( P - s \\) is negative (i.e., Re(P - s) < 0).
