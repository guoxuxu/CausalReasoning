The behavior of the integral depends on the real part of \\( s + \\lambda \\). If the real part of \\( s + \\lambda \\) is positive, the integral converges, and the poles are determined by the singularities of \\( e^{(s + \\lambda)z} \\).\n\n7. **Impact of Imaginary Part**: The imaginary part of \\( z \\) does not affect the poles because the poles are determined by the real part of the exponent \\( s + \\lambda \\). The imaginary part of \\( z \\) would only shift the path of integration in the complex plane, but it does not introduce any new singularities.\n\nTherefore, the poles of the transformed function \\( G(s) \\) are indeed determined solely by \\( \\lambda \\) and are independent of the imaginary part of \\( z \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

However, the poles of \\( G(s) \\) are directly determined by \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n6. **Independence from Imaginary Part**:\n   - The poles do not change if only the imaginary part of \\( s \\) changes; they are solely dependent on the real and imaginary parts of \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nTherefore, the transformed function \\( G(s) \\) has its poles determined solely by \\( \\lambda \\) and independent of the imaginary part of \\( s \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

In our case, if we were to perform a Laplace transform with respect to \\( z \\), it would typically involve an integral over the real axis for \\( z \\). But here, we are dealing with \\( g(z) \\) itself being a complex exponential.\n\n4. **Poles of the Transformed Function**: The poles of the Laplace transform of \\( g(z) \\) would come from the zeros of the denominator in the transformed expression.
