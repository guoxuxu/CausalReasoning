    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the differential equation \\( x'(t) = Kx(t) \\) with initial condition \\( x(0) = x_0 \\). The solution to this differential equation is well-known and can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x(t) = x_0 e^{Kt}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} x(t) dt = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} x_0 e^{Kt} dt = x_0 \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{(K-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges for \\( s > K \\) and evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\frac{x_0}{s - K}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transformation \\( U(t) = t^2 x(t) \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), we introduce the transformation \\( U(t) = t^2 x(t) \\). This means that for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), \\( x(t) \\) is modified by the factor \\( t^2 \\). However, the original differential equation \\( x'(t) = Kx(t) \\) holds only for \\( t < t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Effect on \\( x(t) \\)**: For \\( t < t_1 \\), \\( x(t) \\) remains unchanged and follows the solution \\( x(t) = x_0 e^{Kt} \\). For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), \\( x(t) \\) becomes \\( x(t) = t^2 x_0 e^{Kt} \\).\n\n5. **New Laplace Transform**: To find the new Laplace transform \\( X(s) \\) after the transformation, we need to split the integral into two parts:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{-st} x_0 e^{Kt} dt + \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{-st} t^2 x_0 e^{Kt} dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying these integrals:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = x_0 \\left[ \\int_0^{t_1} e^{(K-s)t} dt + \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} t^2 e^{(K-s)t} dt \\right]\n   \\]\n   The first integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^{t_1} e^{(K-s)t} dt = \\frac{e^{(K-s)t_1} - 1}{s - K}\n   \\]\n   The second integral requires integration by parts or recognizing it as a form of the Gamma function:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} t^2 e^{(K-s)t} dt = \\frac{2 e^{(K-s)t_1}}{(s-K)^3} + \\frac{4 e^{(K-s)t_1}}{(s-K)^4} + \\frac{2!
