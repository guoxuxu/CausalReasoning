  "Problem": "Consider a physical system where temperature \\\\( T \\\\) affects the rate of a chemical reaction according to the Arrhenius equation, given by \\\\( R(T) = A e^{-\\\\frac{E}{RT}} \\\\), where \\\\( E \\\\) is the activation energy, \\\\( R \\\\) is the gas constant, and \\\\( A \\\\) is a pre-exponential factor.

  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "The intervention modifies the temperature profile, introducing \\\\( T_1 \\\\) as a new baseline temperature after \\\\( t_1 \\\\). This change impacts \\\\( R(T) \\\\) directly due to its dependency on \\\\( T \\\\), thus the reaction rate at times t > t_1 depends on the current temperature profile including \\\\( T_1 \\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "Temperature T directly influences the reaction rate R through the Arrhenius equation. Temperature T is determined by the initial temperature T_0 and the rate of change k. After time t_1, the temperature T is solely influenced by T_0, k, and time t, but the reaction rate R at any time t > t_1 depends only on the initial conditions T_0 and k, not on T_1.",
