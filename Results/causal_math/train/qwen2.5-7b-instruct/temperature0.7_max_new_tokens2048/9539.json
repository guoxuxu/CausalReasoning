Here, \\(\\mathcal{F}(T)\\) is the Fourier transform of \\(T(x, y)\\), and \\(e^{-\\beta t}\\) represents a time-dependent damping factor.\n\n3. **Implication of New Transformation**: The application of \\(\\mathcal{G}(T)\\) means that the temperature distribution is modified in the frequency domain with a time-dependent factor. This implies that the temperature distribution in the spatial domain is now influenced by both the original spatial frequencies and a time-dependent decay factor.\n\n4. **Heat Equation in Frequency Domain**: In the frequency domain, the heat equation can be transformed into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for each frequency component.

This means that the evolution of the temperature distribution is no longer purely governed by the original heat equation but includes the influence of the damping factor.\n\n6. **Independence Check**: For the final temperature distribution at \\(T > t_1\\) to evolve independently of the initial Fourier transform, it would mean that the damping factor \\(e^{-\\beta t}\\) does not affect the spatial frequency components anymore. However, since \\(e^{-\\beta t}\\) is explicitly included in the definition of \\(\\mathcal{G}(T)\\), it clearly influences the evolution.\n\nTherefore, the final temperature distribution at \\(T > t_1\\) does not evolve independently of the initial Fourier transform because the damping factor \\(e^{-\\beta t}\\) is part of the transformation and continues to influence the evolution.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

This implies that the Fourier coefficients decay exponentially with time.\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: The effect of \\(\\mathcal{G}(T)\\) is then reversed using the inverse Fourier transform, resulting in a modified temperature distribution \\(T'(x, y, t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\).\n\n5. **Heat Equation Evolution**: The modified temperature distribution \\(T'(x, y, t)\\) continues to evolve according to the heat equation \\(\\frac{\\partial T'}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T'\\) from \\(t_1\\) onwards.\n\n6. **Influence of Initial Fourier Transform**: The initial Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(T)\\) has already been applied and decayed according to \\(e^{-\\beta t}\\).
