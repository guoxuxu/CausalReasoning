    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We have \\( w(z) = e^{z^2} \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex number.\n\n2. **Transformation Definition**: The transformation is given by \\( g(w) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} w(t) \\, dt \\), which is an integral transform with parameter \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Specific Values**: We need to consider \\( z_0 \\) and \\( s_0 \\). The problem asks if \\( g(w) \\) applied to \\( w(z_0) \\) at \\( s = s_0 \\) is equivalent to applying \\( g \\) directly to \\( z_0 \\) under the original function definition.\n\n4. **Substitution**:\n   - First, compute \\( w(z_0) = e^{z_0^2} \\).\n   - Then apply the transformation \\( g \\) to \\( w(z_0) \\) at \\( s = s_0 \\):\n     \\[\n     g(w(z_0)) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s_0 t} e^{z_0^2} \\, dt\n     \\]\n     Since \\( e^{z_0^2} \\) is a constant with respect to \\( t \\), it can be factored out of the integral:\n     \\[\n     g(w(z_0)) = e^{z_0^2} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s_0 t} \\, dt\n     \\]\n\n5. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   - The integral \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s_0 t} \\, dt \\) is a standard exponential integral that evaluates to \\( \\frac{1}{s_0} \\) for \\( s_0 > 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s_0 t} \\, dt = \\frac{1}{s_0}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore,\n     \\[\n     g(w(z_0)) = e^{z_0^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s_0} = \\frac{e^{z_0^2}}{s_0}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Direct Application of \\( g \\)**:\n   - Now, we need to consider \\( g \\) directly applied to \\( z_0 \\) under the original function definition.\n   - This means computing \\( g(z_0) \\) as follows:\n     \\[\n     g(z_0) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s_0 t} w(t) \\, dt\n     \\]\n     Since \\( w(t) = e^{t^2} \\),\n     \\[\n     g(z_0) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s_0 t} e^{t^2} \\, dt\n     \\]\n     Simplifying the integrand,\n     \\[\n     g(z_0) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{t^2 - s_0 t} \\, dt\n     \\]\n\n7. **Comparison**:\n   - We see that \\( g(w(z_0)) = \\frac{e^{z_0^2}}{s_0} \\) and \\( g(z_0) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{t^2 - s_0 t} \\, dt \\).\n   - These two expressions are not generally equivalent because the integrals do not simplify in the same way. The first expression is a simple multiplication by a constant, while the second involves a more complex integral form.\n\nTherefore, the result of the transformation at \\( s = s_0 \\) when applied to \\( w(z_0) \\) is not equivalent to applying \\( g \\) directly to \\( z_0 \\) under the original function definition.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
