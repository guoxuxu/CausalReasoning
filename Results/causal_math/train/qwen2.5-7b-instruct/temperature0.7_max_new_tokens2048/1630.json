However, even if \\( T(x) \\) was not applied, knowing \\( z(X) \\) at \\( x = X \\) alone does not provide enough information to deduce \\( z(0) \\) because it only tells us about the state of the function at \\( x = X \\) and not its initial condition at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
