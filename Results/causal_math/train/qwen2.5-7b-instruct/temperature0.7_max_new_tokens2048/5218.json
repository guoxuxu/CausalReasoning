    "To determine if we can uniquely determine the input waveform from the output spectrum for the given system, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **System Representation**: The system is described by the transfer function \\(H(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b}\\). This is a second-order system, which means it has two poles (the roots of the denominator).\n\n2. **Convolution Operation**: The system's response to an input \\(X(s)\\) is given by the convolution in the time domain, which translates to multiplication in the frequency domain.

However, since \\(H(s)\\) is a rational function with poles but no specified zeros in the numerator, it is generally invertible except at its poles.\n\n6. **Complex Inputs and Spectra**: Complex inputs can be decomposed into real and imaginary parts, and their spectra will similarly consist of complex components. The transformation through \\(H(s)\\) will affect these components, but the relationship between the input and output spectra is still governed by the properties of \\(H(s)\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: While the system's transfer function \\(H(s)\\) is generally invertible, the issue lies in the fact that multiple input waveforms can produce the same output spectrum due to the nature of Fourier transforms and the periodicity of signals.
