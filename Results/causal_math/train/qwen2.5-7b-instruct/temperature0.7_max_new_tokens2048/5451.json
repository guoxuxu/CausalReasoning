    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial System**: The system is described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\). Here, \\(M\\) is a constant matrix, and \\(z(t)\\) is the state vector as a function of time \\(t\\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: Applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   sZ(s) - z(0) = MZ(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\(Z(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s)\\) is the Laplace transform of \\(z(t)\\), and \\(z(0)\\) is the initial condition.
