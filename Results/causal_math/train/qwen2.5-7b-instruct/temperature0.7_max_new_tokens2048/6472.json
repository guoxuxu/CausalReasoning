However, the problem does not specify whether \\( z'(t) \\) is the result of multiplying by \\( e^{-at} \\) or differentiating \\( z(t) \\).\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - If \\( z'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}z(t) \\), then the Fourier Transform of \\( z'(t) \\) is \\( i\\omega Z(\\omega) \\).\n   - If \\( z'(t) = e^{-at}z(t) \\), then the Fourier Transform of \\( z'(t) \\) is \\( Z(\\omega + a) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without additional context, it is impossible to determine from the Fourier Transform alone whether the operation was multiplication by \\( e^{-at} \\), differentiation, or the original signal. Both operations can result in different Fourier Transforms that do not uniquely identify the operation performed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can specify which operations were applied based on the given information, let's analyze each operation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Multiplication by \\( e^{-at} \\)**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( e^{-at} z(t) \\) is \\( F(\\omega - a) \\), where \\( F(\\omega) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n2. **Differentiation with respect to time**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( \\frac{d}{dt} z(t) \\) is \\( j\\omega F(\\omega) \\), where \\( F(\\omega) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Given Information**:\n   - We have the Fourier transform of \\( z'(t) \\), which is the derivative of \\( z(t) \\) after applying one of the operations.\n\nLet's denote the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) as \\( F(\\omega) \\).\n\n- If \\( z(t) \\) was multiplied by \\( e^{-at} \\) first, then differentiated, the resulting Fourier transform would be:\n  \\[ \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(e^{-at} z(t)\\right)\\right\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(e^{-at} z(t)\\right)\\right\\} = j\\omega \\cdot F(\\omega - a) \\]\n\n- If \\( z(t) \\) was differentiated first, then multiplied by \\( e^{-at} \\), the resulting Fourier transform would be:\n  \\[ \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{e^{-at} \\frac{d}{dt} z(t)\\right\\} = F(\\omega - a) \\cdot (-a) = -a F(\\omega - a) \\]\n\n- If only \\( z(t) \\) was differentiated, the resulting Fourier transform would be:\n  \\[ \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt} z(t)\\right\\} = j\\omega F(\\omega) \\]\n\nGiven these transforms, it is clear that the Fourier transform of the derivative after multiplying by \\( e^{-at} \\) and differentiating is distinct from the Fourier transform of the derivative alone and the Fourier transform after differentiating and then multiplying by \\( e^{-at} \\).\n\nTherefore, knowing the Fourier transform of \\( z'(t) \\) allows us to distinguish between these operations.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
