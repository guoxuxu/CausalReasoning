    "To determine whether the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) for \\( s < 1 \\) will depend only on the original form of \\( z(t) \\) when an intervention modifies \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z(t) + t^2 \\), we need to consider how the Laplace transform is defined and how it changes under such modifications.\n\n1. **Definition of Laplace Transform**:\n   The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Original Function**:\n   For the original function \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} [u(t) + iv(t)] \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Modified Function**:\n   When \\( z(t) \\) is modified to \\( z(t) + t^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t) + t^2\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} + \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\} = \\frac{2}{s^3} \\).\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - The Laplace transform of the original function \\( z(t) \\) is \\( F(s) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of the modified function \\( z(t) + t^2 \\) is \\( F(s) + \\frac{2}{s^3} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   For \\( s < 1 \\), the term \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} \\) will be present in the Laplace transform of the modified function. Therefore, the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) for \\( s < 1 \\) will not depend solely on the original form of \\( z(t) \\); it will also include the contribution from \\( t^2 \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
