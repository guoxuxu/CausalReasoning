So, if we denote the Fourier transform of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( F(\\omega) \\) and the Fourier transform of \\( g(x) \\) as \\( G(\\omega) \\), then the Fourier transform of \\( f(x) * g(x) \\) (where * denotes convolution) is \\( F(\\omega) \\cdot G(\\omega) \\).\n\n2. **Applying Filter Function**: Next, a filter function \\( h(x) \\) is applied to the result of the convolution.
