This means that while the magnitude of the original signal can be recovered, the exact phase might not be preserved, leading to potential ambiguities.\n- **Non-uniqueness Issues**: In some cases, especially with periodic or non-bandlimited signals, there might be multiple signals that transform to the same frequency spectrum.\n\nGiven these considerations, we cannot definitively state that \\( x(t) \\) can always be uniquely determined from \\( Y(\\omega) \\) without any ambiguity.
