    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original System**: We start with the system of linear equations \\(Ax = b\\).\n\n2. **Transformation via Laplace Transform**: When we apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the equation, we get \\(\\mathcal{L}(A) * X(s) = \\mathcal{L}(b)(s)\\). Here, \\(X(s)\\) is the Laplace transform of the original vector \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To find the original vector \\(x\\), we need to apply the inverse Laplace transform to \\(X(s)\\). This step is necessary because the Laplace transform converts time-domain functions into the frequency domain, and the inverse Laplace transform reverses this process.\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform is unique for each function in its domain.
