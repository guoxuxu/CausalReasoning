This implies that the solution to this system is \\( x(t) = e^{Mt}x(0) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\( x(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-iwt} dt.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( x(t) = e^{Mt}x(0) \\) into the Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   F(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{Mt}x(0) e^{-iwt} dt = x(0) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(M-iw)t} dt.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Spectrum Analysis**: The integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(M-iw)t} dt\\) converges if and only if the real part of \\( M - iw \\) is negative. This leads to the eigenvalues of \\( M \\) being crucial in determining the spectrum.\n\n4. **Eigenvalues and Spectrum**: The spectrum (or frequency response) of the system can be derived from the eigenvalues of \\( M \\). Specifically, the Fourier transform of the solution \\( x(t) \\) will have peaks at the frequencies corresponding to the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of \\( M \\).\n\n5. **Determining \\( M \\)**: Knowing the spectrum alone does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the matrix \\( M \\). The spectrum only tells us about the eigenvalues of \\( M \\), but it does not specify the eigenvectors or the full structure of \\( M \\). Different matrices with the same set of eigenvalues can have different forms.\n\n6. **Initial State Dependency**: Without knowledge of the initial state \\( x(0) \\), we cannot fully reconstruct the system dynamics because the eigenvectors, which are part of the transformation that diagonalizes \\( M \\), are also unknown.\n\nGiven these points, we conclude that while the spectrum provides important information about the eigenvalues of \\( M \\), it is insufficient to determine the exact matrix \\( M \\) without additional information such as the initial state \\( x(0) \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
