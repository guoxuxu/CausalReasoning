Therefore, observing an increase in the steady-state amplitude of \\( y(t) \\) cannot definitively indicate that the frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the input signal \\( x(t) \\) was increased.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the input signal \\( x(t) \\) can be definitively identified as the cause for an increase in the steady-state amplitude of \\( y(t) \\) based on the given information, let's analyze the system step-by-step:\n\n1. **System Description**:\n   - The input signal is \\( x(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n   - The output \\( y(t) \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} + ay = bx \\).\n\n2. **Steady-State Response**:\n   - For a sinusoidal input \\( x(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), the steady-state response \\( y(t) \\) will also be of the form \\( y(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( A \\) is the amplitude.\n   - Substituting \\( y(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\) into the differential equation:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d(A e^{i\\omega t})}{dt} + a(A e^{i\\omega t}) = b(e^{i\\omega t})\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     i\\omega A e^{i\\omega t} + aA e^{i\\omega t} = b e^{i\\omega t}\n     \\]\n     Dividing through by \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\):\n     \\[\n     i\\omega A + aA = b\n     \\]\n     Factoring out \\( A \\):\n     \\[\n     A(i\\omega + a) = b\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( A \\):\n     \\[\n     A = \\frac{b}{i\\omega + a}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Amplitude Analysis**:\n   - The amplitude \\( A \\) depends on the constants \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and the frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n   - If \\( \\omega \\) increases, the term \\( i\\omega \\) in the denominator becomes larger in magnitude, which generally reduces the overall magnitude of \\( A \\) (since the denominator grows larger).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - An increase in the steady-state amplitude of \\( y(t) \\) would imply that the term \\( i\\omega + a \\) must decrease in magnitude, meaning \\( \\omega \\) cannot be increasing.\n   - Therefore, observing an increase in the steady-state amplitude of \\( y(t) \\) suggests that either \\( b \\) has increased or \\( a \\) has decreased, but not that \\( \\omega \\) has increased.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can definitively say that the frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the input signal \\( x(t) \\) was increased based on an observed increase in the steady-state amplitude of \\( y(t) \\), let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Input Signal and Its Properties**:\n   - The input signal is \\( x(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n   - This is a complex exponential function with frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Output Signal and Governing Equation**:\n   - The output \\( y(t) \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dy}{dt} + a y = b x \\).\n   - Here, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n\n3. **Steady-State Solution Analysis**:\n   - For a linear time-invariant (LTI) system described by such a differential equation, the steady-state response to a sinusoidal input is also sinusoidal with the same frequency as the input.\n   - The form of the solution for the steady-state response \\( y_{ss}(t) \\) to \\( x(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) will be of the form \\( y_{ss}(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( A \\) is the amplitude of the steady-state response.\n\n4. **Amplitude Determination**:\n   - The amplitude \\( A \\) can be determined from the homogeneous and particular solutions of the differential equation.\n   - For the particular solution, assuming \\( y_p(t) = C e^{i\\omega t} \\), substituting into the differential equation gives:\n     \\[\n     i\\omega C e^{i\\omega t} + a C e^{i\\omega t} = b e^{i\\omega t}\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     C (i\\omega + a) = b \\implies C = \\frac{b}{i\\omega + a}\n     \\]\n   - The amplitude \\( A \\) of the steady-state response is the magnitude of \\( C \\):\n     \\[\n     A = \\left| \\frac{b}{i\\omega + a} \\right| = \\frac{|b|}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 + a^2}}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Change in Amplitude**:\n   - If there is an increase in the steady-state amplitude \\( A \\), it implies that the magnitude of \\( \\frac{b}{i\\omega + a} \\) has changed.\n   - Since \\( b \\) and \\( a \\) are constants, the only way for \\( A \\) to change is if the denominator \\( \\sqrt{\\omega^2 + a^2} \\) changes.\n   - Therefore, an increase in \\( A \\) directly indicates a change in \\( \\omega \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - An increase in the steady-state amplitude \\( A \\) of \\( y(t) \\) directly suggests that the frequency \\( \\omega \\) of the input signal \\( x(t) \\) has been changed.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
