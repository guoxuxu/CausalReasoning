    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. We start with the equation \\( AMx = b \\).\n2. We want to determine if we can conclude that the original system was \\( Ax = b \\).\n\n3.

Then the equation becomes:\n     \\[ Ay = bM^{-1} \\]\n\n4. Now, compare this with the original system \\( Ax = b \\):\n   - For \\( Ay = bM^{-1} \\) to imply \\( Ax = b \\), \\( y \\) must equal \\( x \\), which means \\( Mx = x \\).\n   - However, \\( Mx = x \\) only holds true if \\( M \\) is the identity matrix \\( I \\).\n\n5.
