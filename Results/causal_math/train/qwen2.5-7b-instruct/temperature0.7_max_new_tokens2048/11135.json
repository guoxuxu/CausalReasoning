    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original System**: The original system is described by the partial differential equation \\(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + Lz = 0\\).\n\n2. **Application of Laplace Transform**: Applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\left[\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t}\\right] + \\mathcal{L}[Lz] = \\mathcal{L}[0]\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Laplace transform, specifically that \\(\\mathcal{L}\\left[\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t}\\right] = s\\mathcal{L}[z] - z(0)\\) and assuming \\(z(0) = 0\\) for simplicity (or it can be considered in the initial condition context), we have:\n   \\[\n   s\\mathcal{L}[z] + \\mathcal{L}[Lz] = 0\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}[Lz] = -s\\mathcal{L}[z]\n   \\]\n\n3. **System with Control Function**: Now, consider the modified system with a control function \\(u(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + Lz = u(t)\n   \\]\n   Applying the Laplace transform to this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\left[\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t}\\right] + \\mathcal{L}[Lz] = \\mathcal{L}[u(t)]\n   \\]\n   Again using the properties of the Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   s\\mathcal{L}[z] - z(0) + \\mathcal{L}[Lz] = \\mathcal{L}[u(t)]\n   \\]\n   Assuming \\(z(0) = 0\\), we simplify to:\n   \\[\n   s\\mathcal{L}[z] + \\mathcal{L}[Lz] = \\mathcal{L}[u(t)]\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(\\mathcal{L}[Lz]\\) from the previous step:\n   \\[\n   s\\mathcal{L}[z] - s\\mathcal{L}[z] = \\mathcal{L}[u(t)]\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   0 = \\mathcal{L}[u(t)]\n   \\]\n   Which is not generally true unless \\(u(t) = 0\\).
