    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**: The original differential equation is \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z + \\lambda\\).\n\n2. **Transformation Definition**: The transformation is \\(g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z\\). When applied to the initial condition \\(z_0\\) at \\(t=0\\), it becomes \\(g(z_0) = e^{0}z_0 = z_0\\). However, for any general time \\(t\\), we have \\(g(z(t)) = e^{\\alpha t}z(t)\\).\n\n3. **Applying Transformation and Evolving**: If \\(g(z)\\) is applied to the initial condition \\(z_0\\) at \\(t=0\\), then the transformed function at any time \\(t\\) would be \\(e^{\\alpha t}z(t)\\). This means that the new function \\(z'(t) = e^{-\\alpha t}z(t)\\) (since applying \\(g\\) is equivalent to multiplying by \\(e^{\\alpha t}\\), and to reverse it, we multiply by \\(e^{-\\alpha t}\\)) should satisfy the original differential equation when substituted into it.\n\n4. **Verification**: Let's substitute \\(z'(t) = e^{-\\alpha t}z(t)\\) into the original differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-\\alpha t}z(t)) = e^{-\\alpha t}\\frac{dz}{dt} - \\alpha e^{-\\alpha t}z(t)\n   \\]\n   Using \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z + \\lambda\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   e^{-\\alpha t}(i\\omega z(t) + \\lambda) - \\alpha e^{-\\alpha t}z(t) = e^{-\\alpha t}(i\\omega z(t) + \\lambda - \\alpha z(t))\n   \\]\n   For \\(z'(t)\\) to satisfy the original differential equation, we need:\n   \\[\n   e^{-\\alpha t}(i\\omega z(t) + \\lambda - \\alpha z(t)) = i\\omega e^{-\\alpha t}z(t) + \\lambda\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we see that this holds true if \\(-\\alpha z(t) = 0\\), which is not generally true unless \\(\\alpha = 0\\).
