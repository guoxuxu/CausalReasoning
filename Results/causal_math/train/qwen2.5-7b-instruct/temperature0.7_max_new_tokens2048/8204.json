    "Let's break down the problem to reason through it:\n\n1. **System Description**: The output \\( z(t) \\) is determined by an integral transformation of the input \\( x(s) \\) using a kernel \\( K(s, t) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\int_0^T K(s, t) x(s) \\, ds\n   \\]\n   This means that the value of \\( z(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\) is influenced by the entire history of the input \\( x(s) \\) from \\( s = 0 \\) to \\( s = T \\).\n\n2. **Intervention Question**: We want to determine if we can identify whether an intervention (change in \\( x(s) \\)) occurred at a specific time \\( t_1 \\) just by looking at \\( z(T) \\).\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - If there was no intervention, the effect of \\( x(s) \\) on \\( z(T) \\) would be consistent and smooth due to the integral nature of the transformation.\n   - However, if an intervention occurred at \\( t_1 \\), it would cause a discontinuity or a significant change in the behavior of \\( x(s) \\) around \\( t_1 \\).\n   - The integral transformation \\( z(T) \\) would then reflect this change, as the integral accumulates the effect of the input over the entire interval from \\( 0 \\) to \\( T \\).\n\n4. **Key Insight**: While the exact form of \\( K(s, t) \\) is not provided, the fact that \\( z(T) \\) is an integral of the input \\( x(s) \\) means that it captures the overall effect of \\( x(s) \\) over the entire interval.
