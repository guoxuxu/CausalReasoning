This is a complex exponential function with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of the Original Function**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega' t} dt = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function. This indicates that the Fourier transform has a single peak at \\( \\omega' = \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Time Scaling**: If we apply a time scaling factor \\( a \\) to the function, it becomes \\( z(at) = e^{i\\omega at} \\). The Fourier transform of this scaled function is:\n   \\[\n   Z_a(\\omega') = \\frac{1}{|a|} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega at} e^{-i\\omega' t} dt = \\frac{1}{|a|} 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega a - \\omega')\n   \\]\n   This shows that the peak in the Fourier domain occurs at \\( \\omega' = \\omega a \\).\n\n4. **Analyzing the Peak Position**: From the above, we see that if we observe the peak position \\( \\omega' \\) in the Fourier-transformed and time-scaled function, we can directly determine the scaled frequency \\( \\omega a \\).\n\n5. **Determining Both Parameters**: To determine both the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) and the scaling factor \\( a \\):\n   - We know the peak position \\( \\omega' \\) gives us \\( \\omega a \\).\n   - Without additional information about \\( \\omega \\) or \\( a \\), we cannot uniquely determine both parameters just from the peak position alone.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: While we can determine the product \\( \\omega a \\) from the peak position, we need more information (such as a known value for either \\( \\omega \\) or \\( a \\)) to uniquely determine both parameters.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, we cannot determine both the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) and the scaling factor \\( a \\) just by analyzing the peak position.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
