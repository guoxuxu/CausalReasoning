This means \\( u(t) = u_0 \\) (a constant) for all \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform Application**: We need to find the Laplace Transform of \\( z(t) \\). The Laplace Transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i \\omega t} + u(t)\\}\n   \\]\n   Using linearity of the Laplace Transform, we can write:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\} + \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Laplace Transform of Each Term**:\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{s - i \\omega}\n     \\]\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( u(t) \\), which is a constant \\( u_0 \\), is:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{u_0\\} = \\frac{u_0}{s}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combining the Results**:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} + \\frac{u_0}{s}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**: From the expression for \\( Z(s) \\), it is clear that the term \\( \\frac{u_0}{s} \\) depends only on the initial value of \\( u(t) \\) at \\( t=0 \\). The term \\( \\frac{1}{s - i \\omega} \\) is independent of \\( u(t) \\) and depends only on \\( \\omega \\). Therefore, the Laplace Transform \\( Z(s) \\) at any future time \\( t \\) will indeed be solely dependent on the initial choice of \\( u(t) \\) without any external influence once \\( u(t) \\) is set and left unchanged.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
