The result is:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(i-s)t} dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(i-s)t}}{i-s} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n   \\]\n   Evaluating this, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{s-i}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Resulting Laplace Transform**: So, the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{it}\\} = \\frac{1}{s-i}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Uniqueness of Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform is not unique. Multiple functions can have the same Laplace transform, especially when dealing with periodic functions or functions that are not strictly causal. For example, the Laplace transform of \\( e^{it} \\) is the same as the Laplace transform of \\( e^{it} u(t) + e^{it} u(t-2\\pi) + e^{it} u(t-4\\pi) + \\cdots \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about the nature of the function (such as causality or periodicity), the Laplace transform alone does not uniquely determine the original function. Therefore, it is not possible to exactly determine the original function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) from its Laplace transform alone.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
