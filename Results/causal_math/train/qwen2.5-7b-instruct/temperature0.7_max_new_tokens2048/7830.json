The Fourier transform converts the spatial derivatives into multiplication operations in the frequency domain, turning the partial differential equation into an ordinary differential equation.\n\n3. **Implication of Fourier Transform**: If the Fourier transform is applied to the initial condition, the transformed equation will have a solution that can be inverted back to the spatial domain using the inverse Fourier transform to recover \\( u(x, t) \\).
