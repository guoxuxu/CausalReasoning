    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Integral Transformation**: The original integral transformation is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Effect of Polynomial \\( p(t) = t^2 \\)**: When we modify \\( f(t) \\) by adding a polynomial \\( p(t) = t^2 \\), the new function becomes \\( f(t) + t^2 \\). The transformed function would then be:\n   \\[\n   F_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (f(t) + t^2) \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt + \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^2 \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   F_{\\text{new}}(s) = F(s) + \\frac{2}{s^3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention (Addition of \\( c \\) at \\( t_1 \\))**: If we add a constant \\( c \\) at a specific point \\( t_1 \\), the modified function would be \\( f(t) + c \\delta(t - t_1) \\), where \\( \\delta(t - t_1) \\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\( t_1 \\). The integral transformation would then be:\n   \\[\n   F_{\\text{interv}}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (f(t) + c \\delta(t - t_1)) \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt + c e^{-st_1} = F(s) + c e^{-st_1}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Distinguishing Between Interventions**: From the above transformations, we see that the addition of \\( c \\) at \\( t_1 \\) results in an additional term \\( c e^{-st_1} \\) in the transformed function. However, the addition of \\( t^2 \\) results in a different form of additional term \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the terms \\( c e^{-st_1} \\) and \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} \\) are distinct and can be identified from the transformed function \\( F(s) \\), one can conclusively determine whether the intervention (addition of \\( c \\) at \\( t_1 \\)) occurred based solely on the value of \\( F(s) \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
