Again, using Ito's Lemma:\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{X_t}} dX_t - \\frac{1}{4X_t} (dX_t)^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( dX_t \\) from the original SDE:\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{X_t}} (\\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t) - \\frac{1}{4X_t} (\\sigma X_t dW_t)^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = \\left(\\frac{\\mu \\sqrt{X_t}}{2} - \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\sqrt{X_t}}{4}\\right) dt + \\frac{\\sigma \\sqrt{X_t}}{2} dW_t\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = \\left(\\frac{\\mu - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}}{\\sqrt{X_t}}\\right) dt + \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\sqrt{X_t}} dW_t\n   \\]\n\n4. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**:\n   At time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( k(X) = \\sqrt{X} \\) is applied.

It changes the representation of \\(X_t\\) but does not affect the SDE itself.

    "To determine whether the endpoint \\(X(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) depends only on the stochastic parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), not on the transformations applied, we need to analyze the impact of these transformations on the stochastic process described by the given differential equation.\n\n1. **Original Process**: The original process is described by the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n   \\[\n   dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\n   \\]\n   This SDE describes a geometric Brownian motion, which is a common model for asset prices in finance.\n\n2. **Transformation \\(h(X) = X^2\\)**: Applying the transformation \\(h(X) = X^2\\) does not change the underlying dynamics of the process but changes the observable variable. If we define a new process \\(Y_t = X_t^2\\), then:\n   \\[\n   dY_t = 2X_t dX_t + (dX_t)^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(dX_t\\) from the original SDE:\n   \\[\n   dY_t = 2X_t (\\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t) + (\\sigma X_t dW_t)^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   dY_t = (2\\mu X_t^2 + \\sigma^2 X_t^2) dt + 2\\sigma X_t^2 dW_t\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   dY_t = (2\\mu + \\sigma^2) Y_t dt + 2\\sigma Y_t dW_t\n   \\]\n   This shows that the transformed process \\(Y_t\\) also follows a geometric Brownian motion with different parameters.\n\n3. **Transformation \\(k(X) = \\sqrt{X}\\)**: Applying the transformation \\(k(X) = \\sqrt{X}\\) similarly does not change the underlying dynamics but changes the observable variable. If we define a new process \\(Z_t = \\sqrt{X_t}\\), then:\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{X_t}} dX_t - \\frac{1}{4X_t} (dX_t)^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(dX_t\\) from the original SDE:\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{X_t}} (\\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t) - \\frac{1}{4X_t} (\\sigma X_t dW_t)^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2\\sqrt{X_t}} - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{4X_t}\\right) dt + \\frac{\\sigma}{2\\sqrt{X_t}} dW_t\n   \\]\n   This shows that the transformed process \\(Z_t\\) also follows a process with different parameters.\n\n4. **Intervention at Time \\(t_1\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), the transformation \\(k(X) = \\sqrt{X}\\) is applied. This means that from \\(t_1\\) onwards, the process is now defined by the dynamics of \\(Z_t\\). However, the endpoint \\(X(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) is determined by the future evolution of \\(Z_t\\) back to \\(X_t\\).\n\n5. **Dependence on Stochastic Parameters**: The endpoint \\(X(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will still be governed by the original SDE for \\(X_t\\) after the transformation back from \\(Z_t\\). The transformations \\(h(X) = X^2\\) and \\(k(X) = \\sqrt{X}\\) do not alter the fundamental stochastic nature of the process driven by \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the endpoint \\(X(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will indeed depend only on the stochastic parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), not on the transformations applied.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
