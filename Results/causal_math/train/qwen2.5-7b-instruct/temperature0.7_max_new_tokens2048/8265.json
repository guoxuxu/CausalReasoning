    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original PDE Analysis**: The given PDE is \\( u_t + z u_x = 0 \\). This is a first-order linear PDE, which can be solved using the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations for this PDE are:\n   - \\( \\frac{dt}{1} = \\frac{dx}{z} = \\frac{du}{0} \\).\n\n2. **Characteristics**: From these, we get \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = z \\), leading to \\( x = zt + C \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant. Integrating \\( du = 0 \\) along the characteristics gives \\( u = g(C) \\), where \\( g \\) is an arbitrary function determined by the initial condition.\n\n3. **Initial Condition**: If the initial condition is given as \\( u(x,0) = f(x) \\), then \\( u(x,t) = f(x - zt) \\).
