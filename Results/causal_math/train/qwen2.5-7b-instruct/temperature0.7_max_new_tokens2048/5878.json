Here, \\(g(z)\\) is expressed as a power series \\(g(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n z^n\\).\n\n2. **Integral of Power Series**: When integrating a power series term by term over a closed path, we need to consider the properties of each term \\(a_n z^n\\). For \\(n \\neq -1\\), the integral \\(\\oint_C z^n \\, dz\\) is zero because the integrand is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on the contour \\(C\\). However, for \\(n = -1\\), the integral \\(\\oint_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz\\) equals \\(2\\pi i\\) if the contour encircles the origin once in the positive direction (by Cauchy's integral formula).\n\n3. **Applying the Residue Theorem**: If the contour \\(C\\) encircles the origin, the residue theorem tells us that \\(\\oint_C g(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\cdot \\text{Res}(g(z), 0)\\), where \\(\\text{Res}(g(z), 0)\\) is the residue of \\(g(z)\\) at \\(z = 0\\). The residue of \\(g(z)\\) at \\(z = 0\\) is \\(a_{-1}\\), but since \\(a_{-1}\\) does not appear in the given power series, it must be that the only non-zero contribution to the integral comes from the term \\(a_{-1} z^{-1}\\) if such a term exists.\n\n4. **Determining the Coefficients**: Given just the value of the integral \\(\\oint_C g(z) \\, dz\\), we can only determine the coefficient \\(a_{-1}\\) (if it exists) directly. All other coefficients \\(a_n\\) for \\(n \\geq 0\\) cannot be determined solely from the value of this integral because they do not contribute to the integral unless the contour includes a singularity at the origin which is not specified in the problem statement.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about the specific form of \\(g(z)\\) or the contour \\(C\\), we cannot infer all the series coefficients \\(a_n\\) of \\(g(z)\\) accurately from the value of the integral \\(\\oint_C g(z) \\, dz\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

For a power series \\(g(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n z^n\\), the integral depends on the specific form of the series and the path \\(C\\).\n\n2. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**: If \\(g(z)\\) is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on the contour \\(C\\), then by Cauchy's Integral Theorem, \\(\\oint_C g(z) \\, dz = 0\\).
