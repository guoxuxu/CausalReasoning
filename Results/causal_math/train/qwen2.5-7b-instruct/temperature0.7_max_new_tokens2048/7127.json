    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Wave Equation**:\n   - The wave equation given is \\( u_{tt} - c^2 u_{xx} = 0 \\).\n   - This equation describes how a disturbance (wave) propagates through space and time.\n\n2. **Transformation \\( S(u) \\)**:\n   - The transformation \\( S(u) = u(x - v, t - k) \\) represents a shift in both space and time.\n   - This transformation shifts the wave profile to the right by \\( v \\) units in space and to the future by \\( k \\) units in time.\n   - Since the wave equation is linear and homogeneous, such a shift does not change the form of the solution; it merely translates the wave in space and time.\n\n3. **Transformation \\( T(u) \\)**:\n   - The transformation \\( T(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-s^2 x^2} u(x, t) \\, dx \\) is an integral transformation that involves a Gaussian kernel.\n   - This transformation smooths out the function \\( u(x, t) \\) by weighting each value of \\( u(x, t) \\) with a Gaussian function centered at zero.\n\n4. **Intervention at \\( t = t_1 \\)**:\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), the transformation \\( S(u) \\) is applied.\n   - This means that after \\( t_1 \\), the wave profile is shifted according to \\( S(u) \\).\n\n5. **Effect on \\( T(u(x, T)) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\)**:\n   - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the wave profile \\( u(x, t) \\) has already been shifted due to the intervention \\( S(u) \\).\n   - The transformation \\( T(u) \\) then applies its smoothing effect to the shifted wave profile.\n   - The key point here is that \\( T(u) \\) depends on the current state of \\( u(x, t) \\) at any given time \\( t \\), but once the shift due to \\( S(u) \\) has occurred, \\( T(u) \\) will only reflect the smoothed version of the shifted wave.\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The final result of \\( T(u(x, T)) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on the shifted wave profile, which is a consequence of the intervention \\( S(u) \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( T(u(x, T)) \\) cannot be said to depend solely on the wave equation without considering the effect of the intervention \\( S(u) \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
