    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a function \\( x(t) \\) whose Laplace transform is \\( X(s) \\).\n2. **Convolution**: The function \\( x(t) \\) interacts with another function \\( v(t) \\) through a convolution, producing \\( y(t) = (x * v)(t) \\).

Therefore, the new transform \\( Y'(s) \\) will inherently include information about \\( U(s) \\), the Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the new transform \\( Y'(s) \\) includes \\( U(s) \\) and not \\( V(s) \\), it does depend on \\( U(s) \\).
