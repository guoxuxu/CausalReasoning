It is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T\n   \\]\n   This equation tells us that the rate of change of temperature with respect to time is proportional to the Laplacian (second spatial derivative) of the temperature.\n\n2. **Initial Condition Modification**: The initial condition for the modified system is:\n   \\[\n   T(x,0) = T_0 + h(x)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( T_0 \\) is the initial temperature of the system, and \\( h(x) \\) represents the heat source distribution.\n\n3. **Influence of \\( h(x) \\)**: The term \\( h(x) \\) introduces a spatially varying perturbation to the initial temperature.

    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - We have a heat equation \\(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T\\) describing how temperature \\(T\\) changes over time.\n   - The initial condition is modified to \\(T(x,0) = T_0 + h(x)\\), where \\(h(x)\\) represents an unknown heat source distribution.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Heat Equation**:\n   - The heat equation is linear and parabolic.

Over time, it affects how the temperature evolves according to the heat equation.\n   - However, once the system has evolved for some time \\(t > 0\\), the effects of \\(h(x)\\) are integrated into the temperature distribution \\(T(x,t)\\).
