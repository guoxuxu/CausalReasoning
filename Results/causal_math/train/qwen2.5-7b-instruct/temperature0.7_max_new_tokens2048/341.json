    "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a PDE \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\), where \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator.

The evolution of \\(u(x, t)\\) under the PDE will also be linear due to the linearity of \\(L\\).\n\n4. **Integral Property**: The integral transform \\(T\\) is a linear operation.
