This means the system's behavior is consistent over time and the response to any input can be determined by the transfer function.\n\n2. **Input Signal**: The input to the system is a sinusoidal signal given by \\(x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t)\\). When a sinusoidal input is applied to an LTI system, the output is also a sinusoid at the same frequency but may differ in amplitude and phase.\n\n3. **Output Signal**: The output of the system is denoted as \\(y(t)\\).
