    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Signal Representation**: The original signal is given as \\(z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\).

Given that \\(z(t)\\) is composed of two sinusoidal functions, its Fourier transform will have non-zero values at \\(\\pm\\omega\\).\n\n3. **Applying Filter Function \\(H(\\omega)\\)**: When the Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\) is multiplied by \\(H(\\omega)\\), the resulting modified spectrum will be \\(Z'(\\omega) = Z(\\omega)H(\\omega)\\).\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform to Get \\(z'(t)\\)**: The inverse Fourier transform of \\(Z'(\\omega)\\) gives us \\(z'(t)\\).\n\n5. **Reconstructing Original Signal and Filter**: To determine both the original signal \\(z(t)\\) and the filter \\(H(\\omega)\\) from \\(z'(t)\\):\n   - Knowing \\(z'(t)\\) allows us to compute its Fourier transform \\(Z'(\\omega)\\).\n   - From \\(Z'(\\omega)\\), we can find \\(H(\\omega)\\) because \\(Z'(\\omega) = Z(\\omega)H(\\omega)\\). However, this is not straightforward due to the multiplicative nature.\n   - Once \\(H(\\omega)\\) is determined, we need to reconstruct \\(Z(\\omega)\\) and compare it with the known form of \\(z(t)\\)'s Fourier transform to identify \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\n\n6. **Uniqueness and Inverse Problem**: The problem of determining the original signal and the filter from the modified signal is an inverse problem. Such problems often do not have a unique solution unless additional constraints are provided.\n\nGiven these points, while we can attempt to estimate \\(H(\\omega)\\) and \\(z(t)\\) from \\(z'(t)\\), there is no guarantee that we can precisely determine both the original signal and the filter uniquely without additional information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
