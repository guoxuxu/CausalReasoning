It has several important properties, including linearity, time-shifting, and frequency-shifting, but none of these directly address the possibility of perfect recovery without additional information.\n\n2. **Inversion Formula**: There exists an inverse Fourier transform formula that allows us to recover the original time-domain function from its frequency-domain representation:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[Z(\\omega)](t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} Z(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega.\n   \\]\n   This formula theoretically allows for the reconstruction of the original signal \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Assumptions and Conditions**: For the inverse Fourier transform to yield the exact original signal \\( z(t) \\), several conditions must be met:\n   - \\( Z(\\omega) \\) must be the correct Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\).\n   - \\( z(t) \\) must be sufficiently well-behaved (e.g., absolutely integrable over the entire time domain).\n   - No additional noise or modifications should have been introduced after the Fourier transform.\n\n4. **Noise and Modifications**: If any noise or modifications were introduced after the Fourier transform, such as quantization errors, truncation, or additive noise, then the recovered signal might not be exactly the same as the original \\( z(t) \\).
