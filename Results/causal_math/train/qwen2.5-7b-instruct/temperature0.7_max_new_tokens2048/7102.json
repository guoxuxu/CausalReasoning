    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Linear Differential Operator**:\n   - The operator \\( L \\) is defined as \\( Lz = z' + az \\).\n   - This means that for any function \\( z(t) \\), the operator \\( L \\) transforms it into another function involving its derivative and itself scaled by a complex constant \\( a \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**:\n   - The integral transformation \\( T \\) is defined as \\( Tz(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)a} z(s) ds \\).\n   - This transformation integrates the function \\( z(s) \\) from 0 to \\( t \\), weighted by the exponential factor \\( e^{(t-s)a} \\).\n\n3. **Observing \\( z(t) \\) at Time \\( t = T \\)**:\n   - We observe \\( z(t) \\) at some time \\( t = T \\).
