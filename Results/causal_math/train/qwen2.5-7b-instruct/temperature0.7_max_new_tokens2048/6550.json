    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation**: The given differential equation is \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q\\). This is a first-order linear differential equation.\n\n2. **Solve the Differential Equation**: To solve this, we use the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is \\(e^{-Pt}\\). Multiplying both sides of the differential equation by the integrating factor, we get:\n   \\[\n   e^{-Pt} \\frac{dz}{dt} - Pe^{-Pt}z = Qe^{-Pt}\n   \\]\n   The left side is the derivative of \\(ze^{-Pt}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(ze^{-Pt}) = Qe^{-Pt}\n   \\]\n   Integrating both sides from 0 to t, we get:\n   \\[\n   ze^{-Pt} - z(0)e^{-P \\cdot 0} = \\int_0^t Qe^{-Ps} ds\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   ze^{-Pt} - z(0) = -\\frac{Q}{P}(1 - e^{-Pt})\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0)e^{Pt} - \\frac{Q}{P}(1 - e^{-Pt})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine \\(z(T)\\)**: At time \\(T\\),\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z(0)e^{PT} - \\frac{Q}{P}(1 - e^{-PT})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Integral Transformation \\(f(z)\\)**: The transformation is given by:\n   \\[\n   f(z) = \\int_0^t e^{St} z(\\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   However, the problem does not require us to use this transformation directly to determine \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(T)\\).\n\n5. **Trace Back to Determine Initial State**: From the solution of the differential equation, we know that \\(z(T)\\) depends on \\(z(0)\\), \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(T\\). Given \\(z(T)\\), we need to solve for \\(z(0)\\). Rearranging the expression for \\(z(T)\\):\n   \\[\n   z(0) = \\frac{z(T) + \\frac{Q}{P}(1 - e^{-PT})}{e^{PT}}\n   \\]\n\nSince we have a direct relationship between \\(z(T)\\) and \\(z(0)\\) through the parameters \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), and \\(T\\), we can indeed trace back to determine the initial state \\(z_0\\) at \\(t=0\\) given \\(z(T)\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
