    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Function Definitions**:\n   - \\( z = f(x, y) \\): This is a function that maps a point \\((x, y)\\) in the 2D space to a complex number \\(z\\).\n   - \\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\): This is a complex function that takes a complex number \\(z\\) and returns another complex number by squaring it and adding a constant \\(c\\).\n\n2. **Initial Condition**:\n   - At \\(t = 0\\), we have \\(z_0 = f(x_0, y_0)\\).
