    "To determine whether the intervention that changed \\( \\omega \\) occurred before or after applying the transformation \\( f(z) \\), let's break down the causal relationships and the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).

This transformation depends on the value of \\( \\omega \\) at the time of application.\n\n3. **Intervention**: An intervention changes \\( \\omega \\). This change can occur at any point in time relative to the application of the transformation.\n\n4. **Effect of Intervention**: If \\( \\omega \\) is changed after the transformation, the new value of \\( \\omega \\) will not affect the result of the transformation because the integral has already been computed using the original \\( \\omega \\).
