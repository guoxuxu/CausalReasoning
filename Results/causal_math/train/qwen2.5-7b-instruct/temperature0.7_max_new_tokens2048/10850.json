    "To address this question, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the PDE**: The given partial differential equation (PDE) is \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u\\). This is a first-order linear PDE with a negative eigenvalue \\(-\\lambda\\).\n\n2. **Solution Form**: The solution to this PDE can be expressed as \\(u(x, t) = u(x, 0) e^{-\\lambda t}\\). This shows that the function \\(u(x, t)\\) decays exponentially over time if \\(\\lambda > 0\\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Application**:\n   - If the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is applied to \\(u(x, t)\\) initially, it transforms the function from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.\n   - The Fourier transform of \\(u(x, t)\\) is \\(\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x, t) e^{-ikx} dx\\).\n   - Applying the PDE in the frequency domain, the transformed PDE becomes \\(\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda \\hat{u}\\), which has the solution \\(\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-\\lambda t}\\).\n\n4. **Reversing the Process**:\n   - To determine the initial configuration \\(u(x, 0)\\) from \\(u(x, t)\\):\n     - If no Fourier transform was applied, you directly have \\(u(x, 0) = u(x, t) e^{\\lambda t}\\).\n     - If the Fourier transform was applied initially, you would need to apply the inverse Fourier transform to \\(\\hat{u}(k, t)\\) to get back to the spatial domain. However, the form of the solution remains \\(\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-\\lambda t}\\), and the inverse Fourier transform will still allow you to recover \\(\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\) and then \\(u(x, 0)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Whether the Fourier transform was applied initially or not, you can always determine the initial configuration \\(u(x, 0)\\) from \\(u(x, t)\\) using the exponential decay relationship.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is that we can indeed determine the initial configuration \\(u(x, 0)\\) without needing to know whether the Fourier transform was applied initially.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE**: The given partial differential equation (PDE) is \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u\\). This is a first-order linear PDE that describes exponential decay with rate \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n2. **Solution Form**: The general solution to this PDE can be written as \\(u(x, t) = u(x, 0) e^{-\\lambda t}\\). Here, \\(u(x, 0)\\) represents the initial condition of the function \\(u(x, t)\\).\n\n3. **Applying Fourier Transform**: If we apply the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to \\(u(x, t)\\), we get a new function in the frequency domain, say \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, t)\\). However, the Fourier transform does not change the underlying dynamics described by the PDE; it merely transforms the spatial domain into the frequency domain.\n\n4. **Observing at Time t**: If we observe \\(u(x, t)\\) at some time \\(t\\), we have \\(u(x, t) = u(x, 0) e^{-\\lambda t}\\). From this observation alone, we cannot directly determine \\(u(x, 0)\\) because the exponential term \\(e^{-\\lambda t}\\) is also present.\n\n5. **Effect of Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform does not add any additional information about the initial condition \\(u(x, 0)\\). It only changes the representation of the function but does not alter the relationship between \\(u(x, t)\\) and \\(u(x, 0)\\).\n\n6. **Determining Initial Condition**: To determine \\(u(x, 0)\\) from \\(u(x, t)\\), we would need to know either the value of \\(u(x, t)\\) for all \\(x\\) at a specific time \\(t\\), or have additional information about the system (like boundary conditions or other constraints).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we conclude that observing \\(u(x, t)\\) at time \\(t\\) does not allow us to determine \\(u(x, 0)\\) without additional information, regardless of whether the Fourier transform was applied initially.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
