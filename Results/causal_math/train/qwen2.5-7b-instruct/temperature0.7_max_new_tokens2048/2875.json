    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**:\n   - The heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\) describes how the temperature \\( u(x,t) \\) changes with respect to time \\( t \\) and position \\( x \\).\n   - Here, \\( k \\) is a constant that represents the thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier transform \\( \\hat{u}(k, t) \\) converts the spatial distribution \\( u(x, t) \\) into the frequency domain.\n   - This transformation helps in analyzing the solution in terms of different spatial frequencies.\n\n3. **External Heat Source Impact**:\n   - An external heat source can change the distribution at a specific time \\( t_1 \\).
