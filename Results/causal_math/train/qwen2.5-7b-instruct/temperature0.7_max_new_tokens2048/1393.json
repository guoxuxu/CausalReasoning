Therefore, the results should be the same regardless of whether we first transform \\( w \\) into \\( u + iv \\) and then take the Laplace transform, or directly take the Laplace transform of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\).\n\nThus, the Laplace transform of the transformed result \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{w(t)\\} \\) is indeed the same as directly applying the Laplace transformation to each component individually.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation \\(T\\)**:\n   - The transformation \\(T\\) is given by \\(T(x, y) = (u(x, y), v(x, y))\\), where \\(u(x, y) = 2x + 3y\\) and \\(v(x, y) = 5x - 4y\\).\n   - This transformation maps the complex number \\(z = x + iy\\) to a new function \\(w = u + iv\\).\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**:\n   - We need to compare two cases:\n     - Case 1: Applying the Laplace transform to the transformed function \\(w\\), i.e., \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{w(t)\\}\\).\n     - Case 2: Applying the Laplace transform to each component \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) individually and then combining them.\n\n3. **Case 1: \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{w(t)\\}\\)**:\n   - Since \\(w = u + iv\\), if we were to apply the Laplace transform directly to \\(w\\), it would involve transforming the entire function \\(w(t)\\) at once.\n\n4. **Case 2: \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\}\\)**:\n   - If we apply the Laplace transform to each component separately, we get \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\}\\).\n   - Then, the combined Laplace transform would be \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} + i\\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\}\\).\n\n5. **Comparing the Two Cases**:\n   - For the Laplace transform to commute with linear transformations, the original components \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) must be such that their individual Laplace transforms can be combined to give the Laplace transform of the combined function.\n   - However, in this specific case, \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) are linear combinations of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), which means they do not represent time-domain functions directly but rather space-domain functions.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Laplace transform is a linear operator, meaning it can distribute over addition and multiplication by constants.\n   - Therefore, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t) + iv(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} + i\\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\}\\) holds true if \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) are correctly interpreted as functions of time after the transformation \\(T\\).\n\nGiven that the problem involves transforming from a space domain to a time domain through the Laplace transform, and considering the linearity of the Laplace transform, the Laplace transform of the combined function should indeed be the same as the combination of the Laplace transforms of the individual components.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To address this question, let's break down the process step by step.\n\n1. **Transformation \\(T(x, y)\\) to \\(w\\)**:\n   - We have \\(T(x, y) = (u(x, y), v(x, y))\\) where \\(u(x, y) = 2x + 3y\\) and \\(v(x, y) = 5x - 4y\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(w = u + iv = (2x + 3y) + i(5x - 4y)\\).\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**:\n   - If we consider \\(w\\) as a function of time \\(t\\), then \\(w(t) = (2x(t) + 3y(t)) + i(5x(t) - 4y(t))\\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\(w(t)\\) is \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{w(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} w(t) dt\\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of Each Component Individually**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\(u(t) = 2x(t) + 3y(t)\\) is \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (2x(t) + 3y(t)) dt\\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\(v(t) = 5x(t) - 4y(t)\\) is \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (5x(t) - 4y(t)) dt\\).\n\n4. **Comparing the Two Approaches**:\n   - When we apply the Laplace transform to \\(w(t)\\) directly, we get a single expression involving both \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\).\n   - When we apply the Laplace transform to each component individually, we get two separate expressions.\n   - These two approaches are fundamentally different because the Laplace transform of a sum is not necessarily the sum of the Laplace transforms unless the functions are independent.\n\nGiven that the Laplace transform of a sum of functions is not generally equal to the sum of their individual Laplace transforms, we can conclude that:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
