Let the modified spectrum be \\(Z'(\\omega) = Z(\\omega)H(\\omega)\\).\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: The inverse Fourier transform of \\(Z'(\\omega)\\) gives us the modified signal \\(z'(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{Z'(\\omega)\\}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(Z'(\\omega) = Z(\\omega)H(\\omega)\\), the inverse Fourier transform involves filtering the original frequency components according to \\(H(\\omega)\\).\n\n5. **Comparison**: For \\(z'(t)\\) to be the same as \\(z(t)\\), the filter \\(H(\\omega)\\) must not alter the amplitude and phase of the original signal's frequency components. However, if \\(H(\\omega)\\) amplifies or attenuates certain frequencies, then \\(z'(t)\\) will differ from \\(z(t)\\).\n\nGiven that \\(H(\\omega)\\) can change the amplitude and phase of the frequency components, the resulting signal \\(z'(t)\\) will generally not be the same as \\(z(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Signal**: The original signal is given by \\( z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t} \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\( z(t) \\):\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( e^{-i\\omega t} \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) \\).\n   - Therefore, the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     Z(\\omega) = 2\\pi (X \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) + Y \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0))\n     \\]\n\n3. **Filtering**: Modifying the spectrum by a filter \\( H(\\omega) \\):\n   - The filtered spectrum is \\( H(\\omega)Z(\\omega) \\).\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: Inverse Fourier transforming the filtered spectrum to get the modified signal \\( z'(t) \\):\n   - The inverse Fourier transform of \\( H(\\omega)Z(\\omega) \\) involves convolving the impulse response of the filter with the original time-domain signal.\n   - Since the filtering process modifies the amplitudes at specific frequencies, the resulting signal \\( z'(t) \\) will generally not be the same as \\( z(t) \\) unless \\( H(\\omega) \\) is the identity filter (i.e., \\( H(\\omega) = 1 \\) for all \\(\\omega\\)).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Unless the filter \\( H(\\omega) \\) does not alter the amplitudes of the frequencies present in \\( z(t) \\), the resulting signal \\( z'(t) \\) will be different from \\( z(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal**: The signal \\( z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t} \\) is given.
