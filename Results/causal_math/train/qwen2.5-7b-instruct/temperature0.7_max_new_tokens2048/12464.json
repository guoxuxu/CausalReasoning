    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The heat equation is given as \\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\). This describes how the temperature distribution \\(u(x,t)\\) changes over time due to diffusion.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\) transforms the spatial variable \\(x\\) into the frequency domain. The transformed function is denoted as \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi,0)\\).\n\n3. **Transformed Heat Equation**: In the Fourier domain, the heat equation simplifies significantly. If we apply the Fourier transform to both sides of the heat equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k \\xi^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   This is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time \\(t\\).\n\n4. **Solving the ODE**: The solution to this ODE can be found using separation of variables or direct integration.
