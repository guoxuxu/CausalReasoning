    "To determine if we can ascertain whether an intervention occurred based on the transformed value \\( g(z) \\) without prior knowledge of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the System**: The original system is defined by \\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\). This is a quadratic function that maps two variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) into a single variable \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation applied is \\( g(z) = e^z \\). This transformation maps \\( z \\) into another variable \\( g(z) \\), which is an exponential function.\n\n3. **Invertibility of the Transformation**: The function \\( g(z) = e^z \\) is strictly increasing and bijective (one-to-one and onto) over the real numbers.
