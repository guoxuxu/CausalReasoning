    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The initial temperature distribution \\(u(x,0)\\) evolves according to the heat equation with thermal diffusivity \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform in space to both sides of the heat equation gives:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right) = k \\mathcal{F}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Fourier transform, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k \\xi^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   This is a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time, which can be solved as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) = \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) e^{-k \\xi^2 t}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, 0)\\) is the Fourier transform of the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\n3. **Change in Thermal Conductivity**: At time \\(t_1\\), the thermal diffusivity changes to \\(k'\\). However, the change in \\(k\\) only affects the evolution of the system from \\(t_1\\) onwards. For \\(t < t_1\\), the system still evolves with the original diffusivity \\(k\\).\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**: To find the final state \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\), we need to consider the evolution of the system in two phases:\n   - From \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = t_1\\): The solution is \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, t) = \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) e^{-k \\xi^2 t}\\).\n   - From \\(t = t_1\\) to \\(t = T\\): The solution is \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, t) = \\hat{u}(\\xi, t_1) e^{-k' \\xi^2 (t - t_1)}\\).\n\n5. **Independence of Initial Diffusivity**: The final state \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, T)\\) depends on the initial condition \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi, 0)\\) through the factor \\(e^{-k \\xi^2 t_1}\\) and also on the new diffusivity \\(k'\\) through the factor \\(e^{-k' \\xi^2 (T - t_1)}\\). Therefore, the final state does depend on the initial thermal diffusivity \\(k\\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
