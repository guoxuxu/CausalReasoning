    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The function \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = iAz \\). This implies that \\( z(t) = z_0 e^{iAt} \\), where \\( z_0 \\) is the initial value of \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation at \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the function \\( f(z) = e^{-iBt}z \\) is applied. This means that \\( z(t_1) = z_0 e^{iAt_1} \\cdot e^{-iBt_1} = z_0 e^{i(A-B)t_1} \\).\n\n3. **New Function \\( g(z) \\) at \\( t_1 \\)**: Then, at \\( t_1 \\), the function \\( g(z) = e^{-iCt}z \\) is applied. Since \\( z(t_1) = z_0 e^{i(A-B)t_1} \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z_0 e^{i(A-B)t_1} \\cdot e^{-iC(t-t_1)} = z_0 e^{i[(A-B)-C](t-t_1)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final State at \\( T > t_1 \\)**: To find \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z_0 e^{i[(A-B)-C](T-t_1)}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The term \\( e^{i(A-B)t_1} \\) is already part of the state at \\( t_1 \\).\n   - The final expression for \\( z(T) \\) depends on \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\), but specifically, the dependency on \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) is through their difference with \\( A \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on both \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) because they appear in the exponent. However, the problem asks if it depends only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\).
