    "To analyze whether the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) uniquely corresponds to the original function \\( f(z) \\) after the transformation, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Function and Transformation:**\n   - The original function is \\( f(z) = c^z \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) is given by \\( F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Laplace Transform:**\n   - Substitute \\( f(t) = c^t \\) into the Laplace transform formula:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} c^t dt.\n     \\]\n   - This can be simplified to:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = c \\int_0^\\infty (ce^{-s})^t dt.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Analyze the Integral:**\n   - The integral \\( \\int_0^\\infty (ce^{-s})^t dt \\) converges if \\( |c| < e^s \\). If this condition is met, the integral evaluates to:\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^\\infty (ce^{-s})^t dt = \\frac{1}{s - \\ln(c)}.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the Laplace transform becomes:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\frac{c}{s - \\ln(c)}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Uniqueness of the Laplace Transform:**\n   - The Laplace transform \\( F(s) = \\frac{c}{s - \\ln(c)} \\) is unique for each value of \\( c \\) that satisfies \\( |c| < e^s \\).\n   - However, the uniqueness depends on the domain of \\( c \\). For different values of \\( c \\) within the domain, the Laplace transforms will be different.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the condition \\( |c| < e^s \\), the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) uniquely corresponds to the original function \\( f(t) = c^t \\) for a specific \\( c \\).\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude that the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\) uniquely corresponds to the original function \\( f(z) \\) when \\( |c| < e^s \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
