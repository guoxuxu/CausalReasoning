    "To determine whether we can precisely deduce both \\( h(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) from their Laplace transform product \\( H(s)G(s) \\) without additional information, let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Convolution Theorem**: The convolution theorem states that the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is equal to the product of their Laplace transforms.

That means if \\( h_1(t) * g_1(t) = h_2(t) * g_2(t) \\), it does not necessarily imply that \\( h_1(t) = h_2(t) \\) and \\( g_1(t) = g_2(t) \\). There can be many pairs of functions whose convolution results in the same function.\n\n4. **Additional Information Needed**: Without additional constraints or information about the nature of \\( h(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\), such as their support (causal or otherwise), specific forms, or other functional relationships, it is impossible to uniquely determine both \\( h(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) from \\( H(s)G(s) \\) alone.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

    "To determine if we can precisely deduce both \\( h(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) from their Laplace transforms' product \\( H(s)G(s) \\), let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have the product of two Laplace transforms, \\( H(s)G(s) \\), which corresponds to the convolution of the original functions \\( h(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) in the time domain.
