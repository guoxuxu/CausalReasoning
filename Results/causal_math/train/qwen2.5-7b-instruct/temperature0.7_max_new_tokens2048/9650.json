This means that the function \\(h(t)\\) is the result of multiplying \\(x(t)\\) by \\(t^2\\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of \\(h(t)\\)**: The Laplace transform of \\(h(t)\\) is given as \\(H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{t^2 x(t)\\}\\).

Integrating \\(H(s)\\) twice will give us \\(X(s)\\) up to two arbitrary constants of integration. These constants cannot be determined without additional information about \\(x(t)\\) at specific points (initial conditions).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without knowing the form of \\(x(t)\\) or having initial conditions, we cannot uniquely determine \\(x(t)\\) from \\(H(s)\\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
