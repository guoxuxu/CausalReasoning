For \\(f(t) = e^{it}\\), this would integrate \\(e^{is}e^s\\) from 0 to \\(t\\), which gives a new function that is an integral of \\(e^{is}e^s\\) over the interval \\([0, t]\\).\n\n3. **Multiple Transformations**: If we apply another transformation \\(U\\) to the result of \\(T\\), it further modifies the function. The specific form of \\(U\\) is not provided, but it is implied to be some kind of operation that can be applied to the transformed function.\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**: Given the final state after multiple transformations, we need to determine if we can uniquely identify the sequence of transformations (whether it was \\(T\\) followed by \\(U\\) or something else).\n\n5. **Complexity and Uniqueness**:\n   - Each transformation changes the function in a specific way.
