However, the inverse Laplace transform is not uniquely defined for every function. There can be multiple functions whose Laplace transforms match a given function.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Knowing only the Laplace transform of \\( h(t) + g(t) \\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine both \\( h(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) because the inverse Laplace transform is not one-to-one.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Given Function**: We have \\( h(t) = \\sin(\\omega t) \\).\n\n3. **Adding an Arbitrary Continuous Function**: Let \\( g(t) \\) be an arbitrary continuous function. We need to find the Laplace transform of \\( h(t) + g(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t) + g(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (h(t) + g(t)) dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Linearity Property of Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform has a linearity property, meaning that for any constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{af(t) + bg(t)\\}(s) = a\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) + b\\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n   Applying this property to our case:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t) + g(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) + \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Implication on Original Forms**: From the above equation, we see that:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t) + g(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) + \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n   This means that the Laplace transform of \\( h(t) + g(t) \\) can be decomposed into the sum of the Laplace transforms of \\( h(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) individually.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The result of applying the Laplace transform to \\( h(t) + g(t) \\) does not directly imply the original forms of \\( h(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) in a way that allows us to uniquely determine both functions from the combined Laplace transform alone. However, it does allow us to separate the Laplace transforms of the individual functions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
