The solution to this ODE can be found using standard methods for solving such equations.\n\n2. **Solution of the Differential Equation**:\n   To solve \\( \\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\), we can use the method of separation of variables.

Applying the Fourier transform to this evolved function would give:\n   \\[\n   F(f(t))(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} Ce^{\\frac{itz^2}{2}} e^{-isz} dz\n   \\]\n   This is the same as the Fourier transform of \\( f(z) \\) evaluated at time \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   F(f(t))(s) = C \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\frac{itz^2}{2} - isz} dz\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the Fourier transform is a linear operation and the evolution of \\( f(z) \\) under the given differential equation does not change the form of the Fourier transform, the transformed function \\( F(f)(s) \\) at any time \\( t \\) remains the same as the direct transformation of the evolved function \\( f(z,t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the transformed function \\( F(f)(s) \\) at time \\( t \\) will indeed be identical to directly transforming \\( f(z) \\) evolved to time \\( t \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

This is a first-order linear differential equation.\n\n2. **Solution to the Differential Equation**: To solve this differential equation, we can use the method of separation of variables or recognize it as a standard form.

    "To determine if the transformed function \\( F(f)(s) \\) at time \\( t \\) will be identical to directly transforming \\( f(z) \\) evolved to time \\( t \\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation**: The given differential equation is \\( \\frac{df}{dz} = izf(z) \\). This is a first-order linear differential equation.\n\n2. **Solve the Differential Equation**: To solve this, we can use the method of separation of variables.
