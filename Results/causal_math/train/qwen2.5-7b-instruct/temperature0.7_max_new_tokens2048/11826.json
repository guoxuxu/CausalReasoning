    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Laplace Transform**:\n   - The original function is \\( g(t) = t^n f(t) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is \\( G(s) = L\\{t^n f(t)\\} \\).\n\n2. **Intervention with Exponential Decay**:\n   - Introducing an exponential decay factor \\( e^{-at} \\) to \\( g(t) \\) results in a new function \\( h(t) = e^{-at} g(t) = e^{-at} t^n f(t) \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of the New Function**:\n   - We need to find the Laplace transform of \\( h(t) = e^{-at} t^n f(t) \\).\n   - Using the property of the Laplace transform for multiplication by an exponential decay factor, we have:\n     \\[\n     L\\{e^{-at} h(t)\\} = L\\{e^{-at} t^n f(t)\\} = F(s + a)\n     \\]\n     where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The resultant Laplace transform \\( H(s) \\) of \\( h(t) \\) is \\( F(s + a) \\).\n   - This shows that the Laplace transform of the new function \\( h(t) \\) depends on both the original function \\( f(t) \\) and the exponent \\( n \\) through the form of \\( G(s) \\), but it also explicitly depends on the parameter \\( a \\) due to the shift in the Laplace variable.\n   - However, the direct dependence on \\( n \\) is not as explicit as it might seem because the form \\( t^n f(t) \\) itself contributes to the transform, and the overall structure of \\( G(s) \\) involves \\( n \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the Laplace transform of the resultant function \\( h(t) \\) does depend on the original function \\( f(t) \\) and implicitly on \\( n \\) through \\( G(s) \\), but it also depends on the constant \\( a \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Transformation:**\n   - We start with \\( g(t) = t^n f(t) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is \\( G(s) = L\\{t^n f(t)\\} \\).\n\n2. **Intervention:**\n   - An exponential decay factor \\( e^{-at} \\) is added to \\( g(t) \\), resulting in a new function \\( h(t) = t^n f(t) e^{-at} \\).\n   - We need to find the Laplace transform of \\( h(t) \\), which is \\( H(s) = L\\{t^n f(t) e^{-at}\\} \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform Properties:**\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( t^n f(t) \\) can be expressed using the frequency shifting property and the differentiation property.\n   - Specifically, \\( L\\{t^n f(t)\\} = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} F(s) \\), where \\( F(s) = L\\{f(t)\\} \\).\n   - When we multiply \\( t^n f(t) \\) by \\( e^{-at} \\), it shifts the transform by \\( a \\) units in the s-domain: \\( L\\{t^n f(t) e^{-at}\\} = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} (F(s + a)) \\).\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis:**\n   - The resultant Laplace transform \\( H(s) = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} (F(s + a)) \\) explicitly depends on both the original function \\( f(t) \\) (through \\( F(s) \\)) and the exponent \\( n \\).\n   - The term \\( (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} \\) indicates that the order of differentiation and the sign depend on \\( n \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the Laplace transform of the function \\( h(t) = t^n f(t) e^{-at} \\) is indeed dependent on both the original function \\( f(t) \\) and the exponent \\( n \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
