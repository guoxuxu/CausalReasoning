    "To determine if we can deduce the original function \\( z(t) \\) from the transformed function \\( F[z](s) \\) without additional information, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Transformation**: The given transformation is \\( F[z](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\). For \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), we substitute this into the transformation.\n\n2. **Substitute \\( z(t) \\) into the Transformation**:\n   \\[\n   F[z](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{t(i\\omega - s)} \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the Integral**: This is a standard Laplace transform of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n   \\[\n   F[z](s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{t(i\\omega - s)}}{i\\omega - s} \\right]_0^\\infty\n   \\]\n   For the integral to converge, the real part of \\( s - i\\omega \\) must be positive, i.e., \\( \\text{Re}(s) > \\omega \\).\n\n4. **Simplify the Result**:\n   \\[\n   F[z](s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Inverse Transformation**: To check if we can uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\) from \\( F[z](s) \\), we need to consider the inverse Laplace transform.\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\right\\} = e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   This shows that the inverse Laplace transform correctly recovers \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n6. **Uniqueness Consideration**: In general, the Laplace transform is unique for functions that satisfy certain conditions (like being of exponential order).
