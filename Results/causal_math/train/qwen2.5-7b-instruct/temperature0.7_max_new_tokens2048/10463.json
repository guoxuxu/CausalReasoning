This means that from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, the function evolves according to \\( S \\). However, the state of the system at \\( t_1 \\) is already determined by the application of \\( T \\).\n\n4. **Post-intervention Evolution**: For \\( t > t_1 \\), the function evolves according to \\( S \\), but starting from the state determined by \\( T \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{B(T - t_1)}z(t_1) = e^{B(T - t_1)}e^{At_1}z(0)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{B(T - t_1) + At_1}z(0)\n   \\]\n\nFrom the above equation, it is clear that the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).

    "To determine whether the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends solely on \\( A \\) and not on \\( B \\), let's analyze the transformations step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the transformation \\( T(z) = e^{At}z \\).\n\n2. **Intervention**: At time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( S(z) = e^{Bt}z \\) is applied as an intervention. This means that at \\( t = t_1 \\), the state of \\( z \\) changes due to \\( S \\).\n\n3. **Effect of \\( T \\) after \\( S \\)**: We need to determine the state of \\( z \\) at a later time \\( T > t_1 \\). The evolution of \\( z \\) after the intervention can be described as follows:\n   - From \\( t = t_1 \\) to \\( t = T \\), the function \\( z \\) continues to evolve under both \\( T \\) and \\( S \\). However, since \\( S \\) is an instantaneous change at \\( t_1 \\), we need to account for its effect first.\n   - Let \\( z(t_1) \\) be the state of \\( z \\) just after the intervention \\( S \\). Then, \\( z(t_1) = e^{Bt_1}z(t_1^-) \\), where \\( z(t_1^-) \\) is the state of \\( z \\) immediately before the intervention.\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the evolution is given by \\( T \\): \\( z(t) = e^{A(t-t_1)}e^{Bt_1}z(t_1^-) \\).\n\n4. **Endpoint Calculation**:\n   - At time \\( T \\), the state of \\( z \\) is \\( z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}e^{Bt_1}z(t_1^-) \\).\n   - Notice that the term \\( e^{Bt_1} \\) is a multiplicative factor that accounts for the intervention at \\( t_1 \\). The subsequent evolution is governed by \\( T \\), which is influenced only by \\( A \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) because the initial state \\( z(t_1^-) \\) is modified by \\( e^{Bt_1} \\) before continuing with the transformation \\( T \\). Therefore, the final state \\( z(T) \\) includes contributions from both constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
