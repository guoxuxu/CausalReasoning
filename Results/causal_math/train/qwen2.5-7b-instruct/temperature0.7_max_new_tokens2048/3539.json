    "To determine whether the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(u_{new}) \\) depends only on the original \\( \\lambda \\) and not on the form of \\( h(x, y) \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Original Equation**: The given equation is \\( \\nabla^2 u(x, y) = -\\lambda u(x, y) \\). This is an eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian operator with eigenvalue \\( -\\lambda \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The new function is defined as \\( u_{new}(x, y) = u(x, y) + h(x, y) \\), where \\( h(x, y) \\) is a known function.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of a function \\( f(x, y) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(f)(k_x, k_y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x, y) e^{-i(k_x x + k_y y)} \\, dx \\, dy.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Applying the Fourier Transform**:\n   - For \\( u(x, y) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}(u)(k_x, k_y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x, y) e^{-i(k_x x + k_y y)} \\, dx \\, dy.\n     \\]\n   - For \\( h(x, y) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}(h)(k_x, k_y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(x, y) e^{-i(k_x x + k_y y)} \\, dx \\, dy.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the Fourier transform of \\( u_{new}(x, y) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}(u_{new})(k_x, k_y) = \\mathcal{F}(u + h)(k_x, k_y) = \\mathcal{F}(u)(k_x, k_y) + \\mathcal{F}(h)(k_x, k_y).\n     \\]\n\n5. **Eigenvalue Equation in Frequency Domain**: If \\( u(x, y) \\) satisfies the eigenvalue equation \\( \\nabla^2 u(x, y) = -\\lambda u(x, y) \\), its Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(u)(k_x, k_y) \\) satisfies:\n   \\[\n   (k_x^2 + k_y^2) \\mathcal{F}(u)(k_x, k_y) = -\\lambda \\mathcal{F}(u)(k_x, k_y).\n   \\]\n   Hence,\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(u)(k_x, k_y) = A(k_x, k_y) e^{-i\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}},\n   \\]\n   where \\( A(k_x, k_y) \\) is some amplitude function that depends on \\( k_x \\) and \\( k_y \\).\n\n6. **Effect of \\( h(x, y) \\)**: The term \\( \\mathcal{F}(h)(k_x, k_y) \\) does not depend on \\( \\lambda \\) but is determined solely by the properties of \\( h(x, y) \\). Therefore, the overall Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(u_{new})(k_x, k_y) \\) includes both the eigenfunction part and the transform of \\( h(x, y) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(u_{new})(k_x, k_y) = A(k_x, k_y) e^{-i\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}} + \\mathcal{F}(h)(k_x, k_y).\n   \\]\n\nSince \\( \\mathcal{F}(u_{new})(k_x, k_y) \\) includes the term \\( \\mathcal{F}(h)(k_x, k_y) \\), which depends on \\( h(x, y) \\), it follows that the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(u_{new}) \\) does depend on the form of \\( h(x, y) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
