The Dirac delta function \\(\\delta(\\xi - \\omega)\\) indicates that the only frequency component present in the transformed function is at \\(\\xi = \\omega\\).\n   - However, the Fourier transform is not unique because it does not capture the phase information. Any function of the form \\(e^{i\\omega t + \\phi(t)}\\) will have the same Fourier transform if \\(\\phi(t)\\) is such that its Fourier transform is zero.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - While the Fourier transform uniquely identifies the frequency content of the function, it does not provide enough information to determine the exact phase of the function.\n   - Therefore, from the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\delta(\\xi - \\omega)\\), we cannot conclusively infer that the original function was \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\) without additional information about the phase.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Given Function**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is given, where \\( \\omega \\) is a real constant.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Definition**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\xi t} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) into the definition, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\xi t} e^{i\\omega t} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - \\xi)t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Result**: It is given that the Fourier transform result is \\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\), where \\( \\delta(\\cdot) \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n4. **Understanding the Fourier Transform**: The Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\) indicates that the Fourier transform of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) is concentrated at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\). This means that all the frequency content of the signal \\( z(t) \\) is at the frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform is unique up to a set of measure zero. This means that if two functions have the same Fourier transform, they differ only on a set of measure zero (essentially, they are identical almost everywhere).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{z}(\\xi) = \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\) uniquely corresponds to the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), we can conclude that the original function \\( z(t) \\) was indeed \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) without any loss of information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
