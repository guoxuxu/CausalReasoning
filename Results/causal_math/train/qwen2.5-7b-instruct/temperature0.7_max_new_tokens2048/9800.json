The term \\( z^s \\) suggests that \\( z \\) is raised to a complex power, which means \\( z \\) could be any complex number. However, without additional context about how \\( z \\) evolves over time, we cannot directly infer past values of \\( z \\) from this integral alone.\n\n3. **Considering Squaring at an Earlier Point \\( t_1 \\)**:\n   Suppose \\( z \\) was squared at some earlier point \\( t_1 \\).

If \\( z \\) was squared at some earlier point \\( t_1 \\), then \\( z(t_1) = (z_0)^2 \\) for some initial \\( z_0 \\).\n\n3. **Impact on \\( g(z) \\)**: The value of \\( g(z) \\) depends on the integral over all times from 0 to infinity. If \\( z \\) changes at \\( t_1 \\), it will affect the integral after \\( t_1 \\). However, the effect of squaring \\( z \\) at \\( t_1 \\) would be integrated over all subsequent times, making it difficult to isolate this specific change without additional information.\n\n4. **Analysis at Time \\( T \\)**: At time \\( T \\), the value of \\( g(z) \\) is the result of integrating from 0 to \\( T \\) plus the contribution from \\( T \\) to infinity.

To do this, we need to understand how squaring \\( z \\) would affect \\( g(z) \\).\n\n5. **Effect of Squaring \\( z \\)**: If \\( z \\) were squared at some point \\( t_1 \\), it would mean that for \\( t > t_1 \\), \\( z \\) would be replaced by \\( z^2 \\) in the integrand. However, the function \\( g(z) \\) integrates over all \\( s \\) from 0 to infinity, which means it considers the entire history of \\( z \\) from its initial state to the current time \\( t \\).\n\n6. **Complex Integration and History**: Because the integral involves integrating over all \\( s \\) and considering the effect of \\( z \\) at every moment up to \\( t \\), the value of \\( g(z) \\) at any time \\( T \\) encapsulates the entire history of \\( z \\).

The expression \\( z^s \\) suggests that \\( z \\) is raised to a complex power \\( s \\). However, there's no indication in the given information that \\( z \\) was squared at any earlier point \\( t_1 \\).\n\nTo reason further, let's consider if squaring \\( z \\) at \\( t_1 \\) would affect the form of \\( g(z) \\):\n\n1. If \\( z \\) was squared at \\( t_1 \\), then at \\( t_1 \\), the value of \\( z \\) would be \\( z_1 = z^2 \\).\n2. For \\( t > t_1 \\), the function \\( g(z) \\) would still be defined with respect to the original \\( z \\), not \\( z^2 \\).\n\nGiven that the function \\( g(z) \\) does not explicitly depend on any previous transformations (like squaring) of \\( z \\), and only depends on the current value of \\( z \\) and the integration parameter \\( s \\), it is not possible to infer from \\( g(z) \\) at time \\( T \\) whether \\( z \\) was squared at an earlier point \\( t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
