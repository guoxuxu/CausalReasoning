  "Explanation": "The same transformed current I(s) could result from different inductance values due to the linear nature of the differential equation governing the circuit. The impedance interaction (whether \\\\( sL + R \\\\) or \\\\( sL' + R \\\\)) could lead to the same I(s) under suitable conditions for V(t). Hence, it is impossible to determine uniquely which inductance or combinations were implemented.",
