Therefore, the main contribution to the integral comes from the initial values of \\( z(t) \\) near \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Initial Value Theorem**: There is a theorem in Laplace transforms called the Initial Value Theorem, which states that if \\( z(t) \\) is piecewise continuous and of exponential order, then:\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{t \\to 0} z(t) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} sF(s)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Applying the Theorem**: According to the Initial Value Theorem, evaluating \\( F(s) \\) at high values of \\( s \\) (specifically taking the limit as \\( s \\to \\infty \\)) gives us information about the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) as \\( t \\) approaches zero.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: By examining \\( F(s) \\) at high values of \\( s \\), we can indeed deduce the exact behavior of \\( z(t) \\) as \\( t \\) approaches zero, provided the conditions of the Initial Value Theorem are met.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can deduce the exact behavior of \\( z(t) \\) as \\( t \\) approaches zero by solely examining \\( F(s) \\) at high values of \\( s \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform \\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}(z(t)) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} (u(t) + iv(t)) \\, dt = \\mathcal{L}(u(t)) + i\\mathcal{L}(v(t))\n   \\]\n\n2. **Behavior at High Values of \\( s \\)**: When \\( s \\) is very large, the exponential term \\( e^{-st} \\) decays rapidly for all \\( t > 0 \\). This means that the integral is dominated by the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) near \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Initial Value Theorem**: The Initial Value Theorem states that:\n   \\[\n   \\lim_{t \\to 0} z(t) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} sF(s)\n   \\]\n   This theorem directly relates the initial value of \\( z(t) \\) to the behavior of \\( F(s) \\) as \\( s \\) approaches infinity.\n\n4. **Applying the Theorem**: By applying the Initial Value Theorem, we can indeed deduce the exact behavior of \\( z(t) \\) as \\( t \\) approaches zero by examining \\( F(s) \\) at high values of \\( s \\). Specifically, we need to evaluate \\( sF(s) \\) as \\( s \\) tends to infinity.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that yes, we can deduce the exact behavior of \\( z(t) \\) as \\( t \\) approaches zero by solely examining \\( F(s) \\) at high values of \\( s \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
