However, if we consider that the transformation involves some kind of modification or convolution with \\( h(t) \\), this would complicate the problem further.\n\n4. **Determining \\( z(t) \\) and \\( s \\)**: Given only the transformed signal \\( S(z) \\) and the intervention function \\( h(t) = t^2 \\), it is generally not possible to uniquely determine both the original signal \\( z(t) \\) and the exact value of \\( s \\) used.
