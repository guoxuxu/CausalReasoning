This means that if we integrate along the same path but with the transformed function \\( h(g(z)) \\), we need to account for this shift.\n\n3. **Transformed Function**: The transformed function becomes:\n   \\[\n   h(g(z)) = (g(z))^2 + p(g(z)) + q = (z + c)^2 + p(z + c) + q\n   \\]\n   Expanding this, we get:\n   \\[\n   h(g(z)) = z^2 + 2cz + c^2 + pz + pc + q\n   \\]\n\n4. **Transformed Integral**: Now, consider the integral of the transformed function along the path from \\( g(z_0) \\) to \\( g(z_1) \\):\n   \\[\n   I_2 = \\int_{g(z_0)}^{g(z_1)} (z^2 + 2cz + c^2 + pz + pc + q) dz\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**: Notice that \\( I_2 \\) can be split into two parts:\n   - The part involving \\( z^2 + pz + q \\) which is the same as the original integral \\( I_1 \\).\n   - The additional terms \\( 2cz + c^2 + pc + q \\).\n\n6. **Effect of Transformation**: The effect of the transformation \\( g(z) \\) on the integral is to add an extra term due to the linear and constant components in the transformed function.

    "To address the question, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function and Transformation**:\n   - The function \\( h(z) = z^2 + pz + q \\) is a quadratic polynomial.\n   - The transformation \\( g(z) = z + c \\) shifts every point \\( z \\) by a constant \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Integral Along the Path**:\n   - The integral of \\( h(z) \\) along a path from \\( z_0 \\) to \\( z_1 \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(z) \\, dz\n     \\]\n   - Applying the transformation \\( g(z) \\) to the path, the new path starts at \\( z_0' = g(z_0) = z_0 + c \\) and ends at \\( z_1' = g(z_1) = z_1 + c \\).\n\n3. **Effect of the Transformation on the Integral**:\n   - Under the transformation \\( g(z) \\), the new integral becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{z_0 + c}^{z_1 + c} h(z) \\, dz\n     \\]\n   - Using the substitution \\( u = z - c \\), we get \\( du = dz \\) and the limits of integration change accordingly. Thus, the integral transforms as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{z_0 + c}^{z_1 + c} h(z) \\, dz = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(u + c) \\, du\n     \\]\n\n4. **Analyzing the Transformed Integral**:\n   - Substitute \\( z = u + c \\) into \\( h(z) \\):\n     \\[\n     h(u + c) = (u + c)^2 + p(u + c) + q\n     \\]\n   - Expand and simplify:\n     \\[\n     h(u + c) = u^2 + 2uc + c^2 + pu + pc + q\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the transformed integral is:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (u^2 + 2uc + c^2 + pu + pc + q) \\, du\n     \\]\n\n5. **Identifying Alterations**:\n   - Split the integral into parts:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} u^2 \\, du + \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} 2uc \\, du + \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} c^2 \\, du + \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} pu \\, du + \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} pc \\, du + \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} q \\, du\n     \\]\n   - Notice that the terms involving \\( c \\) (i.e., \\( 2uc \\), \\( c^2 \\), \\( pc \\)) will not affect the value of the integral because they are constants with respect to \\( u \\).

This means that if the original path goes from \\( z_0 \\) to \\( z_1 \\), the transformed path will go from \\( z_0 + c \\) to \\( z_1 + c \\).\n\n2. **Integral of the Function**: We need to consider the integral of \\( h(z) \\) along these paths:\n   - Original path: \\( \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(z) \\, dz \\)\n   - Transformed path: \\( \\int_{z_0 + c}^{z_1 + c} h(z) \\, dz \\)\n\n3. **Substitution for the Transformed Path**: Let's make a substitution \\( w = z + c \\). Then \\( dw = dz \\), and the limits of integration change from \\( z_0 + c \\) to \\( z_1 + c \\) to \\( z_0 \\) to \\( z_1 \\). So the transformed integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{z_0 + c}^{z_1 + c} h(z) \\, dz = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(w - c) \\, dw\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluating the Integral**: Now, we need to evaluate the difference between the original integral and the transformed one:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta I = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(z) \\, dz - \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(w - c) \\, dw\n   \\]\n   Since the integrals are over the same path with respect to different functions, we need to understand how \\( h(z) \\) and \\( h(w - c) \\) differ.\n\n5. **Analyzing the Difference**: The function \\( h(z) = z^2 + pz + q \\) transforms under \\( w = z + c \\) to \\( h(w - c) = (w - c)^2 + p(w - c) + q \\). Expanding this:\n   \\[\n   h(w - c) = w^2 - 2cw + c^2 + pw - pc + q\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   h(w - c) - h(w) = -2cw + c^2 - pc\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the difference in integrals is:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta I = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (-2cw + c^2 - pc) \\, dw\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplifying the Integral**: This integral can be split into three parts:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta I = -2c \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} w \\, dw + c^2 \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} 1 \\, dw - pc \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} 1 \\, dw\n   \\]\n   Evaluating these integrals:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta I = -2c \\left[ \\frac{w^2}{2} \\right]_{z_0}^{z_1} + c^2 [w]_{z_0}^{z_1} - pc [w]_{z_0}^{z_1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta I = -c (z_1^2 - z_0^2) + c^2 (z_1 - z_0) - pc (z_1 - z_0)\n   \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The alteration in the integral due to the transformation \\( g(z) = z + c \\) is given by the above expression. This expression shows how the integral changes based on the path endpoints \\( z_0 \\) and \\( z_1 \\), and the constant \\( c \\).\n\nGiven this detailed reasoning, we can identify the alterations made by \\( g(z) \\) or the mid-path intervention based on the specific values of \\( z_0 \\), \\( z_1 \\), and \\( c \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation \\( g(z) = z + c \\) shifts every point \\( z \\) in the complex plane by a constant complex number \\( c \\).
