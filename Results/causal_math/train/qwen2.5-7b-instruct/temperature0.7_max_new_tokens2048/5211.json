    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The given function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\). This represents a complex exponential with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i \\omega t} e^{-i \\omega' t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i (\\omega' - \\omega) t} dt\n   \\]\n   For this integral to converge, we typically consider the periodic nature of the function over one period, which results in a Dirac delta function:\n   \\[\n   Z(\\omega') = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega' - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   This indicates that the Fourier transform localizes the frequency content at \\( \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Scaling Operation**: Applying the scaling operation \\( S(t) = t z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   S(t) = t e^{i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of \\( S(t) \\)**: The Fourier transform of \\( S(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{S(t)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{t e^{i \\omega t}\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Fourier transform that the Fourier transform of \\( t f(t) \\) is \\( i \\frac{d}{d\\omega'} F(\\omega') \\), where \\( F(\\omega') \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( f(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{t e^{i \\omega t}\\} = i \\frac{d}{d\\omega'} \\left[ 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega' - \\omega) \\right] = 2\\pi i \\delta'(\\omega' - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\delta'(\\omega' - \\omega) \\) is the derivative of the Dirac delta function.\n\n5. **Analysis of Information Masking**:\n   - The Fourier transform of the original function \\( z(t) \\) directly reveals the frequency content at \\( \\omega \\).\n   - After applying the scaling operation \\( S(t) \\), the Fourier transform now includes the derivative of the Dirac delta function, which introduces additional complexity but does not completely mask the original frequency \\( \\omega \\). The peak at \\( \\omega \\) still exists, albeit modified.\n\nGiven this analysis, the scaling operation does not completely mask the information about the original angular frequency \\( \\omega \\); it merely modifies the form of the spectral representation.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
