    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Position and Transformation**:\n   - The initial position of the particle is given by \\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\).\n   - The position is then transformed by \\(h(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z\\).\n\n2. **Intervention with Another Transformation**:\n   - At a specific time \\(t_1\\), an additional transformation \\(k(z) = e^{-i\\theta t}z\\) is applied.\n   - We need to determine if the final state \\(z(T)\\) for some \\(T > t_1\\) depends solely on the original equations of motion, not on \\(\\omega\\) or \\(\\theta\\).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Transformations**:\n   - The first transformation \\(h(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z\\) modifies the position based on \\(\\omega\\).\n   - The second transformation \\(k(z) = e^{-i\\theta t}z\\) modifies the position based on \\(\\theta\\).\n\n4. **Effect of the Interventions**:\n   - Applying \\(h(z)\\) at any time \\(t\\) modifies the position as \\(z(t) \\rightarrow e^{i\\omega t}z(t)\\).\n   - Applying \\(k(z)\\) at time \\(t_1\\) modifies the position as \\(z(t_1) \\rightarrow e^{-i\\theta t_1}z(t_1)\\).\n\n5. **Final State Analysis**:\n   - For \\(T > t_1\\), the position after applying both transformations can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{i\\omega T}e^{-i\\theta t_1}z(T)\n     \\]\n   - This expression shows that the final state \\(z(T)\\) still depends on \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\theta\\) because both constants are part of the transformation factors.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the final state \\(z(T)\\) does indeed depend on \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\theta\\). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
