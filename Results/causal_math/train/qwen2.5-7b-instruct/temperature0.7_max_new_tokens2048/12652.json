    "To determine if the Laplace transform \\(\\tilde{z}(s, y)\\) faithfully represents the original function's dependency on \\(y\\), let's analyze the given function and the transformation step by step.\n\n1. **Original Function**: The given function is \\(z = x + iy\\).\n\n2. **Decomposition into Real and Imaginary Parts**: Here, we can decompose \\(z\\) into its real and imaginary parts:\n   - Real part: \\(u(x, y) = x\\)\n   - Imaginary part: \\(v(x, y) = y\\)\n\n3. **Applying the Laplace Transform**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\(u(x, y) = x\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{u(x, y)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{x\\} = \\frac{1}{s^2}\\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\(v(x, y) = y\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{v(x, y)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{y\\} = y\\delta(s)\\), where \\(\\delta(s)\\) is the Dirac delta function.
