This means that from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, the system is governed by:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = cz(t)\n   \\]\n   where \\( z(t) \\) is the state of the system at time \\( t \\).\n\n4. **End Behavior Analysis**: To determine the end behavior as \\( t \\to \\infty \\):\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\), the system follows the feedback loop defined by \\( f(z) \\).\n   - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the system follows the linear transformation \\( g(z) = cz \\).\n\n5. **Behavior Under \\( g(z) \\)**: Since \\( |c| < 1 \\), the system will exponentially decay to zero as \\( t \\to \\infty \\). This is because the differential equation \\( z'(t) = cz(t) \\) has the solution:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(t_1)e^{c(t - t_1)}\n   \\]\n   As \\( t \\to \\infty \\), \\( e^{c(t - t_1)} \\to 0 \\) because \\( |c| < 1 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The end behavior of the system at \\( t \\to \\infty \\) is determined by the stable transformation \\( g(z) \\) applied at \\( t_1 \\), which causes the system to decay to zero. Therefore, even though the initial behavior was influenced by \\( f(z) \\), the long-term behavior is solely determined by \\( g(z) \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
