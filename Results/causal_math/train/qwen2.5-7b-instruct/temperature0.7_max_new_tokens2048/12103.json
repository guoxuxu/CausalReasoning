The inverse Laplace transform of \\( 1/s \\) is \\( u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function (Heaviside step function). This implies that the impulse response of the system is \\( u(t) \\).\n\n3. **Impulse Response**: The fact that the system's impulse response is \\( u(t) \\) indicates that the system is a simple integrator.
