This can be written as \\( H(s) = G(s)F(s) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Transform**: The goal is to determine if the inverse Laplace transform of \\( H(s) \\), denoted as \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\} \\), results in the original function \\( f(t) \\).\n\n4. **Inverse Transform of H(s)**: By definition, \\( H(s) = (s^2 + 1)F(s) \\). The inverse Laplace transform of \\( H(s) \\) would give us \\( h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{(s^2 + 1)F(s)\\} \\).\n\n5. **Linearity and Time-Derivative Property**: The Laplace transform has a property that relates multiplication by \\( s^n \\) in the frequency domain to differentiation in the time domain. Specifically, for \\( n = 2 \\):\n   - Multiplying by \\( s^2 \\) corresponds to taking the second derivative of the time-domain function.\n   - Adding 1 corresponds to adding the original function itself.\n\n6. **Effect on f(t)**: Therefore, \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{(s^2 + 1)F(s)\\} \\) would be the second derivative of \\( f(t) \\) plus \\( f(t) \\) itself:\n   \\[\n   h(t) = f''(t) + f(t)\n   \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since \\( h(t) \\) is not equal to \\( f(t) \\) unless \\( f(t) \\) is a specific form (like a particular solution to the differential equation \\( f''(t) + f(t) = 0 \\)), we conclude that the inverse transform of \\( G(s)F(s) \\) does not generally yield the original function \\( f(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
