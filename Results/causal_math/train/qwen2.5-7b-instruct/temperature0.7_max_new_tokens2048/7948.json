This requires solving the heat equation for both scenarios and analyzing the differences.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nBased on the above analysis, we can precisely identify if the initial condition was modified by \\( g(u_0) \\) because the presence of \\( h(x) \\) will manifest as a non-zero contribution to the temperature distribution.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation describes how the temperature \\(u(x,t)\\) changes over time due to thermal diffusion.
