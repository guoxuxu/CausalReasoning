    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original system is described by \\( z(x) = Kx \\), where \\( K \\) is a complex constant matrix.\n2. An integral transformation \\( I(z) = \\int_{0}^{1} e^{tz} dt \\) is applied to this system.\n3. This means we need to evaluate \\( I(Kx) \\).\n4. When an intervention by applying another transformation \\( L(z) = Mz \\) is introduced, it affects how \\( I(Kx) \\) is evaluated.\n5.

The integral transformation \\( I \\) itself does not depend on \\( M \\); it's defined independently of any other transformation.\n8. However, the final transformation \\( L \\) introduces \\( M \\), which scales the entire result of \\( I(Kx) \\).\n9.

This transformation modifies the input to the original system before it is passed through the integral transformation.\n\n4. **Effect of Intervention**: When the intervention is applied, the new input to the system becomes \\( Mz \\).
