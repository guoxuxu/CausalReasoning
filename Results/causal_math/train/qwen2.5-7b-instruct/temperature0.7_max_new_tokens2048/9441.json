However, the evolution of the fluid flow depends on the initial conditions and the forces acting on the fluid (e.g., pressure gradients, viscous forces, etc.). \n\n4. **Comparison at t=T**: If the fluid flow is allowed to evolve according to the fluid dynamics without further intervention, the path followed by the fluid particles will be different from what it would have been if the vector field \\(\\vec{v}\\) was unaltered. This is because the initial velocity field at \\(t = 0\\) has changed due to the addition of \\(\\nabla h\\).
