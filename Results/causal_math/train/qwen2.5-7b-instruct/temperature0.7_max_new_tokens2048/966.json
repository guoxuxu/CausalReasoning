  "Explanation": "The additional term introduced by \\\\( g(z) \\\\), specifically the frequency-dependent part \\\\( ce^{i\\delta T} \\\\), means the observed \\\\( z(T) \\\\) contains contributions that might not be disentangled from the original amplitude \\\\( x_0 \\\\) without knowing the specifics of \\\\( c \\\\) and \\\\( \\delta \\\\).
