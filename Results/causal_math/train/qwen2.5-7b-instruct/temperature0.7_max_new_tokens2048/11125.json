Then \\( \\dot{w} = \\dot{e^{Ct}}z + e^{Ct}\\dot{z} = Ce^{Ct}z + iAe^{Ct}z = (C + iA)e^{Ct}z = (C + iA)w \\).\n     - The solution to this differential equation is \\( w(t) = e^{(C + iA)t}w(0) \\).\n     - Since \\( w(0) = z_0 \\), we have \\( w(t) = e^{(C + iA)t}z_0 \\).\n     - Therefore, \\( z(t) = e^{-Ct}w(t) = e^{-Ct}e^{(C + iA)t}z_0 = e^{iAt}z_0 \\).\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Direct evolution: \\( z(T) = e^{iAT}z_0 \\).\n   - Transformation followed by evolution: \\( z(T) = e^{iAT}z_0 \\).\n\nBoth methods yield the same result for \\( z(T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
