    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation:**\n   The original differential equation is \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application:**\n   We apply the transformation \\(g(z) = e^{kt}z\\) to a complex number \\(z_0\\) at \\(t = 0\\). This means:\n   - At \\(t = 0\\), \\(g(z_0) = e^{k \\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0\\).\n   - For \\(t > 0\\), \\(g(z) = e^{kt}z\\).\n\n3. **Behavior Under Transformation:**\n   If we allow \\(g(z)\\) to evolve under the differential equation \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\), we need to check how \\(e^{kt}z\\) behaves.\n   \n4. **Differentiate \\(g(z)\\):**\n   Let \\(w = g(z) = e^{kt}z\\). Then,\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{kt}z) = ke^{kt}z + e^{kt}\\frac{dz}{dt}.\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = ke^{kt}z + e^{kt}iz = e^{kt}(kz + iz).\n   \\]\n   Since \\(w = e^{kt}z\\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = e^{kt}(k + i)z.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplifying the Equation:**\n   Notice that \\((k + i)\\) is just another complex number. Let’s denote it as \\(\\alpha = k + i\\). Thus,\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = \\alpha e^{kt}z.\n   \\]\n   However, for the original differential equation \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = iz\\), we have \\(\\alpha = i\\).
