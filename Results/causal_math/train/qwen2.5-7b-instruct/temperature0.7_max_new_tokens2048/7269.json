    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**: This theorem states that if a function \\( f(z) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) within and on a simple closed contour \\( C \\), then the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over \\( C \\) is zero.\n\n2. **Analyticity of \\( f(z) \\)**: The function \\( f(z) = \\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\) is analytic everywhere except at the point \\( z = a \\). This is because \\( e^{z^2} \\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane) and the denominator \\( z - a \\) introduces a singularity at \\( z = a \\).\n\n3. **Contour Consideration**:\n   - If the contour \\( C \\) does not enclose the point \\( a \\), then \\( f(z) \\) is analytic within and on \\( C \\).\n   - According to Cauchy's integral theorem, for an analytic function inside and on a closed contour, the integral over that contour is zero.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the function \\( f(z) = \\frac{e^{z^2}}{z - a} \\) is analytic within any closed contour that does not enclose \\( a \\), applying Cauchy's integral theorem confirms that the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over such a contour will indeed be zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
