    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function given is \\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\).\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation applied is \\( g(z) = e^z \\).\n3. **Change in Variables**: The variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are altered to \\( x' = ax \\) and \\( y' = by \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n4. **New Function Calculation**: We need to calculate the new value of \\( z \\) with the transformed variables and see if it changes the outcome of \\( g(z) \\).\n\nFirst, let's find the new value of \\( z \\) after the transformation:\n\\[ z' = f(x', y') = (ax)^2 + 3(ax)(by) + (by)^2 \\]\n\\[ z' = a^2x^2 + 3abxy + b^2y^2 \\]\n\nNow, we apply the transformation \\( g(z) = e^z \\):\n- For the original \\( z \\): \\( g(z) = e^{x^2 + 3xy + y^2} \\)\n- For the new \\( z' \\): \\( g(z') = e^{a^2x^2 + 3abxy + b^2y^2} \\)\n\nTo determine if these outcomes are the same, we need to compare \\( e^{x^2 + 3xy + y^2} \\) and \\( e^{a^2x^2 + 3abxy + b^2y^2} \\).\n\nFor \\( g(z) \\) to remain unchanged, the exponents must be equal:\n\\[ x^2 + 3xy + y^2 = a^2x^2 + 3abxy + b^2y^2 \\]\n\nThis equality holds only if \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\). In any other case, the exponents will differ, and thus \\( g(z) \\) will also differ.\n\nTherefore, the outcome of \\( g(z) \\) will change unless \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\).\n\nThe final answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Transformation:**\n   - The original function is \\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\).\n   - The transformation applied to \\( z \\) is \\( g(z) = e^z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation of Variables:**\n   - The variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are altered to \\( x' = ax \\) and \\( y' = by \\).\n\n3. **New Function with Transformed Variables:**\n   - Substitute \\( x' \\) and \\( y' \\) into the original function:\n     \\[\n     z' = f(x', y') = (ax)^2 + 3(ax)(by) + (by)^2 = a^2x^2 + 3abxy + b^2y^2\n     \\]\n   - This new function \\( z' \\) represents the value of \\( z \\) after the transformation of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n4. **Comparison of \\( z \\) and \\( z' \\):**\n   - Original \\( z \\): \\( z = x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\)\n   - New \\( z' \\): \\( z' = a^2x^2 + 3abxy + b^2y^2 \\)\n\n5. **Effect on \\( g(z) \\):**\n   - The original \\( g(z) = e^z \\).\n   - The transformed \\( g(z') = e^{z'} \\).\n\n6. **Determine if \\( g(z) \\) Changes:**\n   - For \\( g(z) \\) to remain unchanged, \\( z \\) must equal \\( z' \\).\n   - However, \\( z' = a^2x^2 + 3abxy + b^2y^2 \\) is generally not equal to \\( x^2 + 3xy + y^2 \\) unless \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \\( z' \\neq z \\) for general \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), \\( g(z) \\) will change.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
