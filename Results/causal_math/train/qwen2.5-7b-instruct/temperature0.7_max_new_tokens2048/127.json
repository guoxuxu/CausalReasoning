This modification changes the overall behavior of the circuit, but it does so in a way that is mathematically integrated into \\(H(s)\\). The presence of \\(Z(s)\\) means that \\(H(s)\\) has been modified to account for this new element.\n\n3. **Additional Impedance Z'(s)**: At time \\(t_1\\), an additional impedance \\(Z'(s) = \\frac{s}{s + 2}\\) is introduced. This change affects the circuit's behavior starting from \\(t_1\\). However, the impact of \\(Z'(s)\\) is not simply an addition to \\(H(s)\\); instead, it changes how the system evolves after \\(t_1\\).\n\n4. **System Output After Intervention**: The output of the system for \\(t > t_1\\) will be influenced by both the original \\(H(s)\\) and the effects of \\(Z'(s)\\).
