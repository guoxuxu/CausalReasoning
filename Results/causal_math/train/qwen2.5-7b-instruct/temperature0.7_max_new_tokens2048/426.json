    "To determine if we can accurately find the original state \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t \\in [0, T] \\) without knowing whether \\( g(z) = e^{\\alpha t}z \\) was applied, let's reason through the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation**: The given differential equation is \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z + \\lambda \\). This is a first-order linear differential equation with a complex coefficient and a complex constant term.\n\n2. **Solve the Differential Equation**: To solve this differential equation, we use the integrating factor method. The integrating factor is \\( e^{-i \\omega t} \\). Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor, we get:\n   \\[\n   e^{-i \\omega t} \\frac{dz}{dt} - i \\omega e^{-i \\omega t} z = \\lambda e^{-i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n   The left side is the derivative of \\( z(t) e^{-i \\omega t} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( z(t) e^{-i \\omega t} \\right) = \\lambda e^{-i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n   Integrating both sides with respect to \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) e^{-i \\omega t} = -\\frac{i \\lambda}{\\omega} e^{-i \\omega t} + C\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = -\\frac{i \\lambda}{\\omega} + C e^{i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n   To find \\( C \\), we need the initial condition \\( z(0) = z_0 \\):\n   \\[\n   z_0 = -\\frac{i \\lambda}{\\omega} + C \\implies C = z_0 + \\frac{i \\lambda}{\\omega}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the solution is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = -\\frac{i \\lambda}{\\omega} + \\left( z_0 + \\frac{i \\lambda}{\\omega} \\right) e^{i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transformation by \\( g(z) \\)**: If \\( g(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\) is applied, then the transformed function is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{\\alpha t} \\left( -\\frac{i \\lambda}{\\omega} + \\left( z_0 + \\frac{i \\lambda}{\\omega} \\right) e^{i \\omega t} \\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = -\\frac{i \\lambda}{\\omega} e^{\\alpha t} + \\left( z_0 + \\frac{i \\lambda}{\\omega} \\right) e^{(\\alpha + i \\omega) t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Observing the Trajectory**: By observing the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t \\in [0, T] \\), we can determine the form of \\( z(t) \\). However, the presence of \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\) in the transformed function means that the observed trajectory will be scaled differently depending on the value of \\( \\alpha \\).\n\n5. **Determining \\( z_0 \\) Without Knowing \\( g(z) \\)**: Since the transformation \\( g(z) \\) scales the entire function by \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( z_0 \\) from the observed trajectory alone. The scaling factor \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\) would affect the amplitude of the observed function, making it impossible to distinguish between different values of \\( \\alpha \\) without additional information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
