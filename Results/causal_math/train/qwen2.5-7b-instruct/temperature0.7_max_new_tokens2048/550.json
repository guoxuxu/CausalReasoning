    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the System**: The system is defined by \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\), where \\( a \\) is a complex number.

This transformation scales the state by a factor of \\( c \\).\n\n3. **State at Time T**: Given the state at time \\( T \\) as \\( z(T) \\), we need to determine if we can uniquely determine the initial state \\( z_0 \\) without knowing whether the transformation \\( T(z) \\) was applied.\n\n4. **Reversing the Transformation**: If the transformation \\( T(z) = cz \\) was applied, then the initial state \\( z_0 \\) can be found by reversing the transformation:\n   \\[\n   z_0 = \\frac{z(T)}{c}\n   \\]\n   However, if no transformation was applied, the initial state would simply be \\( z_0 = z(T) \\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Initial State**: Without knowing whether the transformation \\( T(z) \\) was applied, there are two possible initial states: \\( z_0 = z(T) \\) (if no transformation was applied) and \\( z_0 = \\frac{z(T)}{c} \\) (if the transformation was applied).

    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Function**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\) describes an exponential growth or decay process where \\( a \\) is a complex number. This means that over time, the value of \\( z(t) \\) changes based on the real and imaginary parts of \\( a \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: The transformation \\( T(z) = cz \\) scales the function \\( z(t) \\) by a non-zero complex constant \\( c \\).

However, we need to determine if we can uniquely find \\( z_0 \\) (the initial state) without additional information about \\( T(z) \\).\n\n4. **Reversing the Transformation**: To find \\( z_0 \\), we would ideally want to reverse the transformation. If \\( T(z) = cz \\), then applying the inverse transformation \\( T^{-1}(z) = \\frac{z}{c} \\) should give us back the original function.\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Initial State**: The key here is whether the transformation \\( T(z) = cz \\) alone is sufficient to determine the initial state \\( z_0 \\).
