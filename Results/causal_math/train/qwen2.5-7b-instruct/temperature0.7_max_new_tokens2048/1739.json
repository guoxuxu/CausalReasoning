    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Transform**: The initial Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\) is given as \\(F(s)\\).\n\n2. **Modification with \\(g(t)\\)**: When \\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\) is used, its Laplace transform becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at}f(t)\\} = \\frac{F(s-a)}{s-a}\n   \\]\n   This shows that modifying \\(f(t)\\) by \\(e^{at}\\) shifts the transform by \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Intervention with \\(h(t)\\)**: Now, applying \\(h(t) = e^{-bt}f(t)\\) as an intervention, the modified function becomes \\(e^{-bt} \\cdot e^{at}f(t) = e^{(a-b)t}f(t)\\).\n\n4. **Transform of Modified Function**: The Laplace transform of \\(e^{(a-b)t}f(t)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{(a-b)t}f(t)\\} = \\frac{F(s-(a-b))}{s-(a-b)}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Analysis for \\(t > t_1\\)**: The question asks if the new transformed function at \\(t > t_1\\) will be solely dependent on the Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\) shifted by \\(a - b\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Yes, the new transformed function at any \\(t > t_1\\) (or generally for all \\(t\\)) is indeed solely dependent on the Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\) shifted by \\(a - b\\).
