If \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are such that their exponentials do not commute (i.e., \\( e^{A}e^{B} \\neq e^{B}e^{A} \\)), then the order of applying these transformations matters. However, since the problem does not specify the commutativity of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), and we are only asked if we can uniquely recover \\( z_0 \\) without knowing the order, we must consider the general case.\n\nGiven the nature of matrix exponentials and the transformations, if we know \\( w(T) \\), we can indeed uniquely recover \\( z_0 \\) by reversing the transformations. The specific order of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) does not affect the uniqueness of the recovery as long as we follow the correct sequence of inverses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
