This integral accumulates the values of \\(z(\\tau)\\) over time.\n   - Since \\(z(\\tau) = e^{i \\omega \\tau}\\), the integral becomes:\n     \\[\n     F(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i \\omega \\tau} d\\tau = \\frac{1}{i \\omega} \\left(e^{i \\omega t} - 1\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     F(t) = \\frac{-i}{\\omega} \\left(e^{i \\omega t} - 1\\right)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Intervention (Application of \\(g(t)\\))**:\n   - An intervention \\(g(t)\\) would modify the function \\(z(t)\\). If such an intervention occurs at some time \\(t_0\\), then \\(z(t)\\) would change its form after \\(t_0\\).\n   - For example, if \\(g(t)\\) introduces a step change at \\(t_0\\), the integral \\(F(t)\\) would be split into two parts:\n     \\[\n     F(t) = \\int_0^{t_0} z(\\tau) d\\tau + \\int_{t_0}^t (z(\\tau) + g(\\tau)) d\\tau\n     \\]\n   - This would result in a discontinuity in \\(F(t)\\) at \\(t_0\\).\n\n4. **Determining Intervention**:\n   - Given \\(F(T)\\), we need to determine if there was an intervention and at what time it occurred.\n   - The presence of a discontinuity in \\(F(t)\\) at some time \\(t_0\\) would indicate that an intervention occurred.\n   - The exact time \\(t_0\\) can be determined by finding when the slope of \\(F(t)\\) changes significantly.\n\n5. **Uniqueness**:\n   - The uniqueness of determining the time of intervention depends on the nature of the intervention and the function \\(z(t)\\).\n   - If the intervention is a step change and \\(z(t)\\) is smooth, then the time of the intervention can be uniquely determined by the point of discontinuity in \\(F(t)\\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can conclude that given \\(F(T)\\), we can indeed uniquely determine if an intervention took place and at what time it was applied, assuming the intervention is a step change and \\(z(t)\\) is smooth.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
