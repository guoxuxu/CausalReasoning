    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with a function \\( z(x) \\) defined in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Transformation \\( T \\)**: The first transformation applied to \\( z(x) \\) is \\( T(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\). Therefore, after applying \\( T \\), the function becomes \\( \\frac{1}{z(x)} \\).\n\n3. **Transformation \\( S \\)**: Next, the function \\( \\frac{1}{z(x)} \\) undergoes another transformation \\( S(z) = z^2 \\). Applying \\( S \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{z(x)} \\) results in \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{z(x)}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{z(x)^2} \\).\n\n4. **Final Integral**: The integral we need to evaluate is \\( \\int_{\\gamma} T(S(z(x))) \\, dx \\). Substituting the transformations, this becomes \\( \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{1}{z(x)^2} \\, dx \\).\n\n5. **Dependence Analysis**: To determine if the final result depends solely on \\( T \\) and not on \\( S \\), observe that the integral now only involves \\( T \\) (which transformed \\( z(x) \\) into \\( \\frac{1}{z(x)} \\)), and \\( S \\) has been applied as a power transformation.
