    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Quadratic Form Definition**: The quadratic form \\(Q(x) = x^T A x\\) describes a function that takes a vector \\(x\\) and outputs a scalar based on the symmetric matrix \\(A\\).\n\n2. **Linear Transformation**: The transformation \\(Tx\\) maps a vector \\(x\\) to another vector \\(y\\). This can be written as \\(y = Tx\\).\n\n3. **Transformed Quadratic Form**: When we apply the transformation to the quadratic form, we get \\(Q(Tx) = (Tx)^T A (Tx)\\).\n\n4. **Matrix Algebra**: Simplifying the expression for \\(Q(Tx)\\):\n   \\[\n   Q(Tx) = (Tx)^T A (Tx) = x^T (T^T A T) x\n   \\]\n   Here, we used the property of matrix multiplication and transposition: \\((AB)^T = B^T A^T\\).\n\n5. **Effect of Transformation**: The key point here is that the quadratic form \\(Q(Tx)\\) depends on the matrix \\(T^T A T\\) rather than the original matrix \\(A\\). If \\(T\\) is invertible, \\(T^T A T\\) will generally be different from \\(A\\).\n\n6. **Determining Original Vector**: To determine the original vector \\(x\\) from \\(Q(Tx)\\), we would need to know \\(T\\) because the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(Tx\\) is lost when transforming the quadratic form. Without \\(T\\), there is no unique way to map back from \\(Q(Tx)\\) to \\(x\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given only \\(Q(Tx)\\) and the transformed matrix \\(T^T A T\\), it is not possible to uniquely determine the original vector \\(x\\) without additional information about the transformation \\(T\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
