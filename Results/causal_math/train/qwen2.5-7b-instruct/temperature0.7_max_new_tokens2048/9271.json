However, the change in the boundary condition at \\(t_1\\) introduces a discontinuity in the evolution of the problem, which can propagate into the solution.\n\n4. **Contouring Boundary Condition at \\(t_1\\)**: Applying a new contouring boundary condition at \\(t_1\\) means that the boundary of the domain changes.
