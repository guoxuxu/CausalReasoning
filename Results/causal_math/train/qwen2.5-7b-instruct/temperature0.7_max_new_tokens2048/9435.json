    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation and Initial Condition**:\n   - The function \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\), where \\( D \\) is a constant matrix.\n   - This implies that \\( z(t) \\) can be expressed as \\( z(t) = e^{Dt}z(0) \\), where \\( z(0) \\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt \\).\n   - Substituting \\( z(t) = e^{Dt}z(0) \\) into the Fourier transform, we get:\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{Dt} z(0) dt = z(0) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(D-i\\omega)t} dt.\n     \\]\n   - The integral converges if \\( D \\) has eigenvalues with negative real parts (which ensures exponential decay). Assuming this condition holds, the Fourier transform can be evaluated.\n\n3. **Application of Transformation \\( G(z) \\)**:\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( G(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\lambda t} z(t) dt \\) is applied.\n   - This transformation does not directly change the form of \\( z(t) \\) but modifies it through its effect on \\( z(t) \\) after \\( t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Behavior of \\( z(t) \\) Post-Transformation**:\n   - After \\( t_1 \\), the function \\( z(t) \\) is influenced by both \\( D \\) and the additional term from \\( G(z) \\).\n   - However, the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) at any time \\( T > t_1 \\) is still determined by the integral involving \\( e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) \\), which remains dependent on \\( D \\) because the exponential term \\( e^{Dt} \\) dominates the behavior of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will still be determined primarily by the matrix \\( D \\) due to the exponential growth/decay nature of the solution to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\).\n   - The effect of \\( G(z) \\) is localized around \\( t_1 \\) and does not fundamentally alter the long-term behavior described by the Fourier transform.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is that the Fourier transform of \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the matrix \\( D \\) and not on the effects of \\( G(z) \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\), where \\( D \\) is a constant matrix. This means that the solution to this differential equation can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{Dt} z(0)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( z(0) \\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Transformation at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( G(z) \\) is applied, defined by:\n   \\[\n   G(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\lambda t} z(t) dt\n   \\]\n   This transformation is an intervention that modifies the state of \\( z(t) \\) after \\( t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Behavior After Transformation**: For \\( t > t_1 \\), the state of \\( z(t) \\) is now influenced by both the original dynamics and the effect of the transformation \\( G(z) \\). However, the problem asks if the Fourier transform of \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the matrix \\( D \\) and not on the effects of \\( G(z) \\).\n\n4. **Fourier Transform Analysis**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}(z(T)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega T} z(T) dT\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( z(t) \\) is now influenced by both the original dynamics and the transformation \\( G(z) \\), we need to consider how these factors affect the Fourier transform.\n   - The original dynamics \\( \\dot{z} = Dz \\) imply that \\( z(t) \\) has a specific form that is determined by \\( D \\). However, the transformation \\( G(z) \\) introduces a different weighting factor \\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\), which changes the state of \\( z(t) \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) after \\( t_1 \\) will include contributions from both the original dynamics and the effect of \\( G(z) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend on both the matrix \\( D \\) and the effects of the transformation \\( G(z) \\). Therefore, it cannot be said that it depends solely on \\( D \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
