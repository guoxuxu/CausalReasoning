The radius of this circle is 1 because the magnitude of \\( e^{ibt} \\) is always 1.\n\n4. **Effect of \\( e^{at} \\)**: The term \\( e^{at} \\) scales the magnitude of \\( z(t) \\) by \\( e^{at} \\). If \\( a > 0 \\), the magnitude increases over time, and if \\( a < 0 \\), it decreases. However, if \\( a = 0 \\), the magnitude remains constant.\n\n5. **Spiral Path**: For the path from \\( z(0) \\) to \\( z(T) \\) to be a spiral, the magnitude must change while the angle continues to rotate. This occurs when \\( a \\neq 0 \\) and \\( b \\neq 0 \\).
