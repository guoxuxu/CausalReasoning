    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with an initial state \\( x_0 \\).\n\n2. **Impulse Response Application**: The impulse response \\( h(x) = Kx \\) is applied to the initial state \\( x_0 \\). This results in a new state \\( y_0 = h(x_0) = Kx_0 \\).\n\n3. **System Dynamics**: The system evolves according to the dynamics \\( \\dot{x} = Dx \\).
