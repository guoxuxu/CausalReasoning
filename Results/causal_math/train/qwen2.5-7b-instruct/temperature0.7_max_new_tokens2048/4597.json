    "To determine if applying the transformation \\( h(w) = e^{i\\theta}w \\) to the contour will result in the same value for \\( g(z) \\), we need to analyze how this transformation affects the integral defining \\( g(z) \\).\n\n1. **Original Function Definition**:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_C \\frac{f(w)}{w - z} dw\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( C \\) is a closed contour enclosing \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application**:\n   Let's apply the transformation \\( h(w) = e^{i\\theta}w \\) to the contour \\( C \\). This means that each point \\( w \\) on the contour \\( C \\) is mapped to \\( e^{i\\theta}w \\). However, the key point is to see how this transformation affects the integral.\n\n3. **Parameterization of the Contour**:\n   Suppose the contour \\( C \\) is parameterized by \\( w(t) \\) for \\( t \\in [a, b] \\). Under the transformation, the new contour can be parameterized by \\( w(t) \\mapsto e^{i\\theta}w(t) \\).\n\n4. **Integral Transformation**:\n   The integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{C'} \\frac{f(e^{i\\theta}w)}{(e^{i\\theta}w - z)} e^{i\\theta} dw\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the expression inside the integral:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{C'} \\frac{f(e^{i\\theta}w)}{e^{i\\theta}(w - e^{-i\\theta}z)} e^{i\\theta} dw = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{C'} \\frac{f(e^{i\\theta}w)}{w - e^{-i\\theta}z} dw\n   \\]\n\n5. **Change in Contour**:\n   Notice that the contour \\( C' \\) is still a closed contour enclosing \\( z \\) (since \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) is a rotation which does not change the enclosed area). Therefore, the integral is over the same region.\n\n6. **Analyticity and Cauchy's Integral Formula**:\n   Since \\( f(w) \\) is analytic in the domain excluding \\( z \\), the function \\( f(e^{i\\theta}w) \\) is also analytic in the domain excluding \\( e^{-i\\theta}z \\). By Cauchy's integral formula, the value of the integral remains the same because the function being integrated and the contour are unchanged in terms of their properties relevant to the integral.\n\nTherefore, applying the transformation \\( h(w) = e^{i\\theta}w \\) to the contour does not change the value of \\( g(z) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
