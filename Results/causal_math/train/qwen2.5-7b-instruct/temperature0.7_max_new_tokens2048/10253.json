The difference between these two functions will become more pronounced as \\( t \\) increases.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Transform**: The initial Laplace transform is given by \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s - p} \\).\n\n2. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform of \\( F(s) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   f(t) = e^{pt}\n   \\]\n   This follows from the standard form of the Laplace transform for an exponential function.\n\n3. **Change in Parameter**: Now, let's consider the change in the parameter \\( p \\) to \\( p + \\delta \\). The new Laplace transform becomes:\n   \\[\n   F'(s) = \\frac{1}{s - (p + \\delta)} = \\frac{1}{s - p - \\delta}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform of the New Function**: The inverse Laplace transform of \\( F'(s) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   f'(t) = e^{(p + \\delta)t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison of Functions**: Comparing \\( f(t) \\) and \\( f'(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(t) = e^{pt}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   f'(t) = e^{(p + \\delta)t} = e^{pt} \\cdot e^{\\delta t}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Behavior Analysis**: The function \\( f'(t) \\) is not the same as \\( f(t) \\). Specifically, \\( f'(t) \\) is \\( f(t) \\) multiplied by \\( e^{\\delta t} \\), which means that the behavior of \\( f'(t) \\) is different from \\( f(t) \\). The additional term \\( e^{\\delta t} \\) will affect the amplitude of \\( f(t) \\) over time, leading to a different behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
