    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's recall the original function:\n   \\( z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{y} dy \\)\n   The derivative of \\( z(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is simply \\( e^x \\) because the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that if \\( F(x) = \\int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt \\), then \\( F'(x) = f(x) \\).\n\n2. Now, consider the modified function:\n   \\( z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{2y} dy \\)\n\n3. To find the derivative of this new function, we need to apply the chain rule inside the integral:\n   Let \\( u = 2y \\), then \\( du = 2dy \\) and \\( dy = \\frac{1}{2}du \\).\n   So, the integral can be rewritten as:\n   \\( z(x) = \\int_{0}^{2x} \\frac{1}{2}e^{u} du \\)\n   \n4. Now, applying the fundamental theorem of calculus to the transformed integral:\n   \\( \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{2x} \\frac{1}{2}e^{u} du \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}e^{2x} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(2x) \\)\n   Since \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = 2 \\), the derivative simplifies to:\n   \\( \\frac{d}{dx} z(x) = e^{2x} \\)\n\n5. Comparing this result with the derivative of the original function, which was \\( e^x \\):\n   We see that the derivative does not hold the simple relationship to \\( e^x \\). Instead, it results in \\( e^{2x} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Will the simple derivative relationship to \\( e^{x} \\) still hold?\" is No.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function Analysis**:\n   - The original function is \\( z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{y} dy \\).\n   - We know that the antiderivative of \\( e^y \\) with respect to \\( y \\) is \\( e^y \\). \n   - Evaluating this from 0 to \\( x \\) gives us \\( z(x) = e^x - e^0 = e^x - 1 \\).\n\n2. **Derivative Relationship**:\n   - The derivative of \\( z(x) = e^x - 1 \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{d}{dx}(e^x - 1) = e^x \\).\n   - This shows that the derivative of \\( z(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) indeed follows the pattern of \\( e^x \\).\n\n3. **Modified Function Analysis**:\n   - Now, the modified function is \\( z(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} e^{2y} dy \\).\n   - To find the antiderivative of \\( e^{2y} \\), we use substitution.
