Since \\( R(t) \\) is not directly included in the current formula given (it does not appear in the integral expression for \\( I(t) \\)), it seems like the current \\( I(t) \\) is only directly dependent on \\( V(t) \\) as per the provided formula.\n\n5. **Consider the impact of the changing resistance on the voltage source:**\n   Even though \\( R(t) \\) changes with time, the direct formula for \\( I(t) \\) does not explicitly include \\( R(t) \\). The changing resistance affects \\( V(t) \\) through the overall system dynamics, but the current \\( I(t) \\) is still calculated based on the input voltage \\( V(t) \\) alone.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Based on the provided information and the formula for \\( I(t) \\), the output current \\( I(t) \\) at any moment \\( t \\) is solely dependent on the input voltage \\( V(t) \\) without explicitly considering the resistance changes, as the resistance is indirectly affecting the voltage source but not directly influencing the current calculation in the given integral form.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThe output current \\( I(t) \\) is not solely dependent on the input \\( V(t) \\) because the changing resistance \\( R(t) \\) indirectly affects the voltage source \\( V(t) \\), which in turn influences the current \\( I(t) \\).",
    "Let's analyze the given system step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Current-Input Relationship:**\n   The current \\(I(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-(t - \\tau)} V(\\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   This equation shows that the current at any time \\(t\\) is determined by integrating the voltage \\(V(\\tau)\\) from 0 to \\(t\\), weighted by the exponential function \\(e^{-(t - \\tau)}\\).\n\n2. **Voltage Source Function:**\n   The voltage source is given by:\n   \\[\n   V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\n   \\]\n   This is a sinusoidal function with amplitude \\(V_0\\) and angular frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\n3. **Substitute the Voltage Source into the Current Equation:**\n   Substitute \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\) into the current equation:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-(t - \\tau)} V_0 \\sin(\\omega \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   Factor out the constant \\(V_0\\):\n   \\[\n   I(t) = V_0 \\int_0^t e^{-(t - \\tau)} \\sin(\\omega \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n\n4. **Consider the Effect of Resistance:**\n   The resistance \\(R(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   R(t) = 1 + \\sin(\\omega t)\n   \\]\n   However, the problem states that we need to determine if the output current \\(I(t)\\) is solely dependent on the input \\(V(t)\\) without considering resistance changes. This means we should not use \\(R(t)\\) to modify \\(V(t)\\) directly in our analysis.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   From the derived equation for \\(I(t)\\), it is clear that \\(I(t)\\) is a direct function of \\(V(t)\\) through the integral transformation. The resistance \\(R(t)\\) does not appear in the expression for \\(I(t)\\) as it does not affect the input voltage \\(V(t)\\) in this context.\n\nTherefore, the output current \\(I(t)\\) at any moment \\(t\\) is solely dependent on the input \\(V(t)\\) without considering resistance changes.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Given Equations:**\n   - Current \\( I(t) \\) is given by the integral transformation:\n     \\[\n     I(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-(t - \\tau)} V(\\tau) d\\tau\n     \\]\n   - Voltage source \\( V(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\n     \\]\n   - Resistance \\( R(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     R(t) = 1 + \\sin(\\omega t)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\( V(t) \\) into the Integral:**\n   Substitute \\( V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t) \\) into the integral for \\( I(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   I(t) = \\int_0^t e^{-(t - \\tau)} V_0 \\sin(\\omega \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = V_0 \\int_0^t e^{-(t - \\tau)} \\sin(\\omega \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n\n3. **Consider the Effect of Resistance:**\n   The resistance \\( R(t) \\) affects the voltage source \\( V(t) \\).
