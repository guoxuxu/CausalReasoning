If \\( Q(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( q(t) \\), then the modified response after the second convolution is:\n   \\[\n   H_f(s) = H_g(s) \\cdot Q(s) = \\frac{Q(s)}{(s^2 + bs + c)(s - a)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Analytical Determination of Interventions**:\n   To determine the exact forms of \\( g(t) \\) and \\( q(t) \\) from \\( H_f(s) \\), we need to factorize and compare:\n   \\[\n   H_f(s) = \\frac{Q(s)}{(s^2 + bs + c)(s - a)}\n   \\]\n   From this equation, we can see that the denominator of \\( H_f(s) \\) is already known as \\( (s^2 + bs + c)(s - a) \\). Therefore, \\( Q(s) \\) must be the remaining factor in the numerator. This implies that \\( Q(s) \\) can be determined directly from the given \\( H_f(s) \\) by isolating the numerator.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Since we can isolate \\( Q(s) \\) from \\( H_f(s) \\) by dividing \\( H_f(s) \\) by the known denominator, and knowing \\( G(s) \\) allows us to find \\( g(t) \\), we can indeed determine both \\( g(t) \\) and \\( q(t) \\) analytically based on the modified response \\( H_f(s) \\) in the Laplace domain.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
