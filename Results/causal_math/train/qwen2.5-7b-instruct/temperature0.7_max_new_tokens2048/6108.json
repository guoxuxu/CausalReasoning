The system output is given by \\( y(t) = L(h(t) * x(t)) \\), where \\( h(t) \\) is the impulse response of the system.\n\n2. **Convolution Operation**: The convolution operation \\( h(t) * x(t) \\) represents the interaction between the input signal \\( x(t) \\) and the system's impulse response \\( h(t) \\). The result of this convolution is then passed through the linear operator \\( L \\) to produce the output \\( y(t) \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\) is given as \\( X(s) \\). Since the system is LTI, the Laplace transform of the output \\( y(t) \\) can be expressed in terms of the Laplace transforms of the input and the impulse response:\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = L\\{y(t)\\} = L\\{L(h(t) * x(t))\\} = H(s)X(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( H(s) \\) is the transfer function of the system, which is the Laplace transform of the impulse response \\( h(t) \\).\n\n4. **Reconstructing \\( x(t) \\)**: To determine \\( x(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\), we need to reverse the operations:\n   - First, take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( Y(s) \\) to get \\( y(t) \\).\n   - Then, apply the inverse of the linear operator \\( L \\) to \\( y(t) \\) to obtain \\( h(t) * x(t) \\).\n   - Finally, use the inverse convolution operation to isolate \\( x(t) \\).\n\n5. **Inverse Operations**:\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\( Y(s) \\) gives \\( y(t) \\).\n   - If \\( Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \\), then \\( X(s) = Y(s) / H(s) \\).\n   - Taking the inverse Laplace transform of \\( X(s) \\) gives \\( x(t) \\).\n\nGiven these steps, if we know \\( y(t) \\) and \\( H(s) \\), we can indeed determine \\( X(s) \\) and subsequently \\( x(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
