    "To answer this question, let's break down the process and analyze it step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: We have a complex function \\(z(s) = e^{sZ}\\), where \\(s\\) is a complex variable and \\(Z\\) is a complex matrix.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Application**: The Laplace transform of \\(z(t)\\) is defined as \\(L\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt\\).
