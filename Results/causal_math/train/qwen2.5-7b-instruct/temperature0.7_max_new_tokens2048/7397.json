The Fourier transform of \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\) is \\( \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{u}}{\\partial t} \\) and the Fourier transform of \\( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\) is \\( (-k^2) \\widehat{u} \\). Therefore, the transformed PDE is \\( \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{u}}{\\partial t} = -D k^2 \\widehat{u} \\).\n\n4. **Solving the Transformed PDE**:\n   - The transformed PDE \\( \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{u}}{\\partial t} = -D k^2 \\widehat{u} \\) is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time with respect to \\( k \\). The solution to this ODE is \\( \\widehat{u}(k, t) = \\widehat{u}(k, 0) e^{-D k^2 t} \\).\n\n5. **Comparing the Two Scenarios**:\n   - In the first scenario, the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\) evolves under the PDE to become \\( u(x, T) \\).\n   - In the second scenario, the Fourier transform of the initial condition \\( \\widehat{u}(k, 0) \\) evolves according to the ODE and then transforms back to the spatial domain to give \\( u(x, T) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Fourier transform method effectively diagonalizes the PDE, allowing for independent evolution of each frequency component. The result of evolving \\( \\widehat{u}(k, 0) \\) and then transforming back is equivalent to evolving \\( u(x, 0) \\) under the original PDE. This is due to the linearity of the Fourier transform and the convolution theorem, which preserves the form of the PDE in the frequency domain.\n\nTherefore, the transformed system's state \\( \\widehat{u}(k, T) \\) at time \\( T \\) will indeed be the same as if \\( u(x, 0) \\) had evolved directly under the given PDE to time \\( T \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\": \"Yes\"}"
