This is a complex exponential with a constant angular frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(i\\omega - s)t} dt\n   \\]\n   For this integral to converge, the real part of \\(s\\) must be greater than the real part of \\(i\\omega\\). Since \\(\\omega\\) is purely imaginary, the condition simplifies to \\( \\Re(s) > 0 \\).\n\n3. **Evaluating the Integral**: The integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(i\\omega - s)t}}{i\\omega - s} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n   \\]\n   For \\( \\Re(s) > 0 \\), the exponential term \\( e^{(i\\omega - s)t} \\) decays as \\(t \\to \\infty\\), so the limit as \\(t \\to \\infty\\) is zero. At \\(t = 0\\), the value is \\( \\frac{1}{i\\omega - s} \\).\n\n4. **Final Laplace Transform Expression**: Therefore, the Laplace transform is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Inference from the Laplace Transform**: Given the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\), we can see that the original signal \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) has a specific form. However, the Laplace transform does not uniquely determine \\(\\omega\\) because the same form of the Laplace transform could correspond to different values of \\(\\omega\\) (as long as \\(\\omega\\) remains purely imaginary).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about \\(\\omega\\), we cannot uniquely determine the original signal \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) from the Laplace transform alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
