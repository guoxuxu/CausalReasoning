    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function Analysis**:\n   - The function \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\). This is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation.\n   - The solution to this differential equation is \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of Initial Function**:\n   - Applying the Fourier transform to \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\Omega t} dt = A \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - \\Omega)t} dt\n     \\]\n   - The integral evaluates to a Dirac delta function:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = A 2\\pi \\delta(\\Omega - \\omega)\n     \\]\n   - This indicates that the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) has a single peak at frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Intervention Analysis**:\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), we apply an additional function \\( g(t) = e^{i\\theta t} \\) to \\( z(t) \\). This means the new function becomes \\( z'(t) = z(t) + e^{i\\theta t} \\).\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\), \\( z'(t) = z(t) \\).\n   - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), \\( z'(t) = z(t) + e^{i\\theta t} \\).\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of Intervened Function**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z'(t) \\) for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\) can be split into two parts:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{z'(t)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t) + e^{i\\theta t}\\}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( z(t) \\) is only altered after \\( t_1 \\), we consider the contribution from \\( e^{i\\theta t} \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i\\theta t}\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\Omega - \\theta)\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, for \\( t > t_1 \\), the Fourier transform of \\( z'(t) \\) includes both the original peak at \\( \\omega \\) and a new peak at \\( \\theta \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{z'(t)\\} = A 2\\pi \\delta(\\Omega - \\omega) + 2\\pi \\delta(\\Omega - \\theta)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Fourier transform for \\( t > t_1 \\) now reflects not only the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) but also a new frequency \\( \\theta \\).\n   - Therefore, the frequency spectrum changes due to the intervention.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
