The nature of this transformation can vary based on the definition of \\(L\\), but generally, it will modify \\(G(z)\\) according to the rules of \\(L\\).\n\n3. **Intervention with \\(H(t)\\)**: Now, consider the modified transformation \\(L[H \\cdot G]\\).

If \\(H(t)\\) is a function of \\(t\\) only and does not depend on \\(z\\), then its effect on the transformed function will be through its multiplication with \\(G(z)\\).
