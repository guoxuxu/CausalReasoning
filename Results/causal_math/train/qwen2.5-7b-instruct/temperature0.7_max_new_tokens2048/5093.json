    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Natural Response**:\n   - The natural response of an RLC circuit is the behavior of the system when there is no external forcing function (like the sinusoidal voltage source in this case).\n   - The natural response is governed by the homogeneous part of the differential equation \\(L \\ddot{Q} + R \\dot{Q} + \\frac{Q}{C} = 0\\).\n\n2. **Effect of Sinusoidal Voltage Source**:\n   - When a sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\) is introduced, it becomes a non-homogeneous term in the differential equation.\n   - This new term affects the overall behavior of the system, causing the charge \\(Q\\) to oscillate with a frequency \\(\\omega\\) and amplitude that depends on the initial conditions and the parameters \\(L\\), \\(R\\), and \\(C\\).\n\n3. **Implication of Applying the Voltage Source at \\(t = 0\\)**:\n   - If the sinusoidal voltage source is applied at \\(t = 0\\), it immediately starts influencing the system.\n   - The solution to the differential equation will now be a superposition of the natural response (due to the initial conditions and the original RLC parameters) and the forced response (due to the sinusoidal input).\n\n4. **Future Behavior**:\n   - Once the sinusoidal voltage source is applied, the system will no longer solely follow the natural response of the RLC circuit.\n   - The natural response will be modified by the presence of the sinusoidal forcing function, leading to a new steady-state behavior where the charge \\(Q\\) will oscillate with the frequency \\(\\omega\\) imposed by the voltage source.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The system will not follow the natural response of the RLC circuit alone after the sinusoidal voltage source is applied at \\(t = 0\\).\n   - Instead, it will exhibit a combined response including both the natural and forced components.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

This means the charge \\(Q(t)\\) will decay over time due to the energy dissipation through the resistor \\(R\\).\n\n2. **Sinusoidal Voltage Source Introduction**: When a sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 \\sin(\\omega t)\\) is introduced at \\(t = 0\\), it adds an external forcing term to the system. This changes the behavior of the circuit from its natural response to a forced response.\n\n3. **Forced Response Characteristics**: With the sinusoidal input, the system will have both a transient response (due to the initial conditions) and a steady-state response. The steady-state response will be a sinusoidal function that matches the frequency of the input voltage.\n\n4. **Effect on Natural Response**: The introduction of the sinusoidal voltage source at \\(t = 0\\) disrupts the natural exponential decay process. The system now oscillates at the frequency of the input voltage, rather than following the original natural response determined by the RLC parameters alone.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, after introducing the sinusoidal voltage source at \\(t = 0\\), the system does not follow the natural response induced originally by the RLC combination for all future times.
