    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Fourier Transform**:\n   - The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\) is a Dirac delta function: \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\Omega) \\), where \\( \\Omega \\) is the angular frequency corresponding to the exponential term.\n\n2. **Applying Perturbation**:\n   - We apply the perturbation function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\) (for \\( t \\geq 0 \\)) to \\( z(t) \\). This results in \\( y(t) = z(t) \\cdot h(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha t} = e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t} \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of Altered Signal**:\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( y(t) = e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t} \\) is \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - (\\Omega + \\alpha)) \\).\n\n4. **Analysis of New Spectrum**:\n   - The new spectrum shows a peak at \\( \\omega = \\Omega + \\alpha \\).\n   - Knowing only the spectrum, we can see that the peak has shifted from \\( \\Omega \\) to \\( \\Omega + \\alpha \\).\n\n5. **Determining the Perturbation**:\n   - The shift in the peak indicates an additional frequency component due to the multiplication by \\( h(t) \\).\n   - However, the specific form of \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\) is not directly discernible from the spectrum alone. The spectrum only tells us about the frequency shift but not the exact functional form of the perturbing factor.\n\nBased on this analysis, we cannot determine precisely whether \\( h(t) \\) was applied based solely on the new spectrum because the information about the specific form of \\( h(t) \\) is lost in the Fourier Transform process.

The presence of a non-zero imaginary part in the frequency shift is a clear indication that \\( h(t) \\) was applied.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Based on the new spectrum, we can determine that \\( h(t) \\) was applied because it introduces a non-zero imaginary component to the frequency shift, which would not occur if no perturbation was applied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can precisely identify whether \\( h(t) \\) was applied based solely on the new spectrum, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and its Fourier Transform**:\n   - The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is a Dirac delta function: \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\}(\\xi) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\).\n\n2. **Perturbation Application**:\n   - The perturbation function is \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function.\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( h(t) \\) is: \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{-\\alpha t} u(t)\\}(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha + i\\xi} \\).\n\n3. **Combined Function and its Fourier Transform**:\n   - The combined function after applying \\( h(t) \\) is \\( z(t) \\cdot h(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha t} u(t) = e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t} u(t) \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of the combined function is: \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t} u(t)\\}(\\xi) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha - i(\\xi - \\omega)} \\).\n\n4. **Analysis of the New Spectrum**:\n   - The new spectrum is \\( \\frac{1}{\\alpha - i(\\xi - \\omega)} \\).\n   - This spectrum is different from the original spectrum \\( 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\) because it is a shifted and scaled version of the original spectrum due to the application of \\( h(t) \\).\n\n5. **Determining the Perturbation**:\n   - Given the new spectrum \\( \\frac{1}{\\alpha - i(\\xi - \\omega)} \\), we can infer that it has been shifted by \\( \\omega \\) and has a pole at \\( \\xi = \\omega - \\alpha \\).\n   - This information uniquely identifies the perturbation as a time-domain exponential decay multiplied by a unit step function, which corresponds to the function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} u(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the new spectrum, we can precisely determine that \\( h(t) \\) was applied.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Original Function**:\n   - The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - This represents a simple sinusoidal signal with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( Z(f) = \\delta(f - \\omega) \\), where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n   - This indicates that the spectrum is a single impulse at frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Multiplying by \\( h(t) \\)**:\n   - We then multiply \\( z(t) \\) by \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function (to ensure causality).\n   - The resulting function is \\( z(t) \\cdot h(t) = e^{i \\omega t} e^{-\\alpha t} u(t) = e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t} u(t) \\).\n\n4. **Applying the Fourier Transform to the Altered Signal**:\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\cdot h(t) \\) is given by the convolution of the individual transforms: \\( H(f) * Z(f) \\).\n   - Since \\( Z(f) = \\delta(f - \\omega) \\), the convolution simplifies to \\( H(f) \\) evaluated at \\( f = \\omega \\).\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} u(t) \\) is \\( H(f) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha + j 2 \\pi f} \\).\n   - Therefore, evaluating \\( H(f) \\) at \\( f = \\omega \\) gives \\( H(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha + j 2 \\pi \\omega} \\).\n\n5. **Determining the Presence of \\( h(t) \\)**:\n   - The presence of \\( h(t) \\) introduces a phase shift and a frequency-dependent attenuation to the spectrum.\n   - Specifically, the spectrum now has a term \\( \\frac{1}{\\alpha + j 2 \\pi \\omega} \\) instead of just a Dirac delta function.\n   - This modified spectrum will have a non-zero value at \\( f = \\omega \\) due to the effect of \\( h(t) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the altered spectrum, we can indeed determine that \\( h(t) \\) was applied because the spectrum will no longer be purely a Dirac delta function at \\( \\omega \\). Instead, it will have a specific form that indicates the presence of the exponential decay factor introduced by \\( h(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
