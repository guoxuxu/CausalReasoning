If we know \\(\\hat{u}(k, T)\\) at time \\(T\\), we can use the inverse Fourier transform to get \\(\\hat{u}(k, T)^{-1}\\) back to the spatial domain.\n\n4. **Reconstructing the Solution**: Given that \\(L\\) is a linear differential operator, the solution to the PDE can be expressed as an integral involving the Fourier transform of the initial condition and the evolution operator \\(e^{Lt}\\). If we know \\(\\hat{u}(k, T)\\), we can use this information to reconstruct the solution at any earlier time \\(t=0\\).\n\n5. **Determining Initial Condition**: Since the Fourier transform is invertible, we can indeed determine the original function \\(u(x, 0)\\) from \\(\\hat{u}(k, T)\\) without needing to know the Fourier transform was applied initially.
