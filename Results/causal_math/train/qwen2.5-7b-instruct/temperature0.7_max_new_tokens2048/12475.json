This function is periodic and oscillates in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i\\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( s > 0 \\), this integral converges and evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Frequency Interpretation**: The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\) maps the time-domain signal to the complex frequency domain. Here, \\( s \\) is the complex frequency variable, and \\( \\omega \\) is the angular frequency of the original signal.\n\n4. **Effect of Intervening \\( \\omega \\)**: If there were an intervention that changed the frequency \\( \\omega \\) from its original value, the new Laplace transform would be:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z'(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega'}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\omega' \\) is the new frequency after the intervention.\n\n5. **Identifying the Intervention**: By comparing the transformed functions \\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\) and \\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega'} \\), we can directly identify if there was a change in \\( \\omega \\). Specifically, if the transformed function changes from \\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega'} \\), then \\( \\omega \\neq \\omega' \\), indicating an intervention.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the direct relationship between the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) and the form of the Laplace transform, we can indeed determine whether there was an intervention in the frequency \\( \\omega \\) merely by inspecting the final Laplace transform.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
