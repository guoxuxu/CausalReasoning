This means that for any given time \\( t \\), the point on the unit circle is given by \\( e^{it} \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\)**:\n   - Applying \\( f \\) to \\( z(t) \\) gives \\( z(t)^2 = (e^{it})^2 = e^{i2t} \\).\n   - This transformation squares the angle, effectively doubling it.\n\n3. **Transformation \\( g(z) = z^3 \\)**:\n   - Applying \\( g \\) to \\( z(t) \\) gives \\( z(t)^3 = (e^{it})^3 = e^{i3t} \\).\n   - This transformation triples the angle.\n\n4. **Intervention at \\( t_1 \\)**:\n   - If \\( g(z) = z^3 \\) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\), then the new state of \\( z \\) becomes \\( z(t_1)^3 = (e^{it_1})^3 = e^{i3t_1} \\).\n\n5. **Final State Analysis**:\n   - If only \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied at \\( t = 0 \\), then the state evolves as follows:\n     - At \\( t = t_1 \\): \\( z(t_1) = e^{i2t_1} \\).\n     - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the state continues to evolve as \\( z(t) = e^{i2(t-t_1)} \\cdot e^{i2t_1} = e^{i2t - i2t_1 + i2t_1} = e^{i2t} \\).\n   - If \\( g(z) = z^3 \\) is applied at \\( t_1 \\), then the state at \\( t_1 \\) becomes \\( e^{i3t_1} \\). For \\( t > t_1 \\), the state evolves as \\( z(t) = e^{i3(t-t_1)} \\cdot e^{i3t_1} = e^{i3t - i3t_1 + i3t_1} = e^{i3t} \\).\n\n6. **Comparison**:\n   - The state at \\( T > t_1 \\) if only \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied is \\( e^{i2T} \\).\n   - The state at \\( T > t_1 \\) if \\( g(z) = z^3 \\) is applied at \\( t_1 \\) is \\( e^{i3T} \\).\n\nSince \\( e^{i2T} \\neq e^{i3T} \\) unless \\( T = 0 \\), the final observed states will indeed differ.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "To analyze this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State and Function Application**:\n   - The initial function is \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which represents a unit circle in the complex plane.\n   - If \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied, then the transformation becomes \\( z(t) = (e^{it})^2 = e^{i2t} \\).\n   - This means that the argument of \\( z \\) doubles over time.\n\n2. **Intervention and Its Effect**:\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention \\( g(z) = z^3 \\) is applied.\n   - Applying \\( g(z) \\) after \\( f(z) \\) would mean applying \\( g(f(z)) = (z^2)^3 = z^6 \\).\n   - So, the transformation becomes \\( z(t) = (e^{it})^6 = e^{i6t} \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Comparison with Only \\( f(z) \\) Applied**:\n   - If only \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied starting from \\( t = 0 \\), the transformation is \\( z(t) = e^{i2t} \\).\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the state would be \\( z(t) = e^{i2(t-t_1)} \\cdot e^{i2t_1} \\) because the transformation starts from \\( e^{i2t_1} \\) and continues as \\( e^{i2(t-t_1)} \\).\n\n4. **Final States Comparison**:\n   - If \\( g(z) = z^3 \\) is applied at \\( t_1 \\), the state at \\( T > t_1 \\) is \\( z(T) = e^{i6(T-t_1)} \\).\n   - If only \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied, the state at \\( T > t_1 \\) is \\( z(T) = e^{i2(T-t_1)} \\cdot e^{i2t_1} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The states \\( e^{i6(T-t_1)} \\) and \\( e^{i2(T-t_1)} \\cdot e^{i2t_1} \\) are different because the exponents are not the same.\n   - Therefore, the final observed state \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed differ if \\( g(z) = z^3 \\) is applied compared to only \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) being applied.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
