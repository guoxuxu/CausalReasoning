However, the Laplace transform information is embedded in the poles of \\( F(s) \\), and knowing the exact form of \\( F(s) \\) does not directly give us the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) without additional information.\n\nGiven the above steps, while we can infer that a Fourier transform was applied and possibly identify its parameter \\( b \\) if \\( a = 0 \\), we cannot definitively deduce both the original function \\( z(t) \\) and the nature of the individual transformations (specifically the value of \\( a \\)) solely from the complex spectrum at frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can deduce both the original function \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\) and the nature of the individual transformations applied (Laplace and Fourier transforms), let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n1. **Original Function Analysis**:\n   - The given function is \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\).\n   - This can be rewritten using Euler's formula as \\( z(t) = e^{at}(\\cos(bt) + i\\sin(bt)) \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) \\).\n   - For \\( z(t) = e^{(a+bi)t} \\), the Laplace transform is \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)} \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier transform is typically applied to functions defined over all time, i.e., \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t \\in (-\\infty, \\infty) \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(a+bi)t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\( Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{t(a+(b-i\\omega))} dt \\).\n   - This integral converges only if \\( a < 0 \\). If \\( a < 0 \\), the result is \\( Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{a + bi - \\omega} \\).\n\n4. **Combining Both Transforms**:\n   - First, apply the Laplace transform to get \\( F(s) \\).\n   - Then, apply the Fourier transform to \\( F(s) \\) to get \\( Z(\\omega) \\).\n\n5. **Deduction**:\n   - From \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-(a+bi)} \\), we can deduce that the original function was of the form \\( e^{(a+bi)t} \\).\n   - From \\( Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{a + bi - \\omega} \\), we can confirm the nature of the Fourier transform.\n   - Since we know the original function and its Laplace transform, we can infer the nature of the Laplace transform.\n   - The Fourier transform can be deduced from the Laplace transform by evaluating it along the imaginary axis.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can indeed deduce both the original function and the nature of the individual transformations applied.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
