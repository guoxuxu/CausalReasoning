However, the Dirac delta function \\(\\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\\) retains the same peak at \\(\\omega\\), but the amplitude is scaled by \\(e^{i\\phi}\\).\n\n5. **Determination of Phase Shift**: Given only \\(Z(\\omega) = e^{i\\phi} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\\), it is not possible to determine the exact value of \\(\\phi\\) because the magnitude of the Fourier transform (the delta function's height) does not provide any information about the phase.
