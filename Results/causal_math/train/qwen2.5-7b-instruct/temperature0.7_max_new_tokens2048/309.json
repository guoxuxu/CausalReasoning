    "Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) where \\( A \\) is a complex number.

The integral we are interested in is \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\). According to Cauchy's theorem, if \\( f(z) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on a simple closed contour \\( C \\), then the integral is zero. \n\n3. **Analyticity of \\( f(z) \\)**: The function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) is entire, meaning it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane. Therefore, according to Cauchy's theorem, for any closed contour \\( C \\):\n   \\[ \\int_C e^{Az} \\, dz = 0 \\]\n\n4. **Effect of Different Paths**: Since \\( f(z) \\) is analytic, the value of the integral around any closed path does not depend on the specific path chosen, only on the fact that it is a closed path. Thus, different paths in the complex plane do not alter the result of the integral.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that \\( f(z) \\) is analytic, the contour of integration does not change the result of the integral. The integral around any closed contour will always be zero due to Cauchy's theorem.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We have \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex number. This means \\( A = a + bi \\) for some real numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n2. **Exponential Function in Complex Plane**: The function \\( e^{Az} \\) can be rewritten using Euler's formula as:\n   \\[\n   e^{Az} = e^{(a+bi)z} = e^{az}e^{biz} = e^{az}(\\cos(bz) + i\\sin(bz))\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( e^{az} \\) is a real exponential term, and \\( \\cos(bz) + i\\sin(bz) \\) is a complex exponential term that describes rotation and scaling in the complex plane.\n\n3. **Contour Integration**: When we integrate \\( f(z) \\) over a closed contour \\( C \\) in the complex plane, we need to consider the properties of the function \\( f(z) \\). Specifically, we need to check if \\( f(z) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) within and on the contour \\( C \\).\n\n4. **Analyticity of \\( f(z) \\)**: Since \\( e^{Az} \\) is an entire function (it is holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane), it satisfies the Cauchy-Goursat theorem.

    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\) where \\( A \\) is a complex number, can be written as \\( e^{A(x+iy)} = e^{Ax}e^{iAy} \\). Here, \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are real parts of \\( z \\), and \\( A \\) has both real and imaginary components.\n\n2. **Contour Integration Basics**: For a function \\( f(z) \\) integrated over a closed contour \\( C \\), the result depends on the properties of \\( f(z) \\) and the path \\( C \\).\n\n3. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**: If \\( f(z) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) everywhere inside and on a simple closed contour \\( C \\), then the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over \\( C \\) is zero. This is a fundamental result in complex analysis.\n\n4. **Analyticity of \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\)**: The function \\( e^{Az} \\) is entire, meaning it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane. This is true regardless of the values of \\( A \\) because the exponential function is well-known to be entire.\n\n5. **Path Independence**: Since \\( e^{Az} \\) is analytic everywhere, the value of the integral \\( \\int_C e^{Az} \\, dz \\) will not change if we deform the contour \\( C \\) continuously without passing through any singularities (which don't exist for this function).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that \\( e^{Az} \\) is entire and there are no singularities, Cauchy's Integral Theorem guarantees that the integral over any closed contour \\( C \\) will be zero, and this result does not depend on the specific path chosen for the contour.\n\nTherefore, the contour of integration in the complex plane does not alter the result of \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) where \\( C \\) is a closed contour, provided no intervention is made during integration.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To address the question, let's break down the analysis into steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function given is \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\), where \\(A\\) is a complex number. This means that for any \\(z = x + iy\\) (where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers and \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit), \\(f(z) = e^{A(x+iy)} = e^{Ax}e^{Aiy}\\).\n\n2. **Exponential Function Behavior**: The exponential function \\(e^{Ax}\\) will scale the magnitude of \\(z\\) by \\(e^{Ax}\\). The term \\(e^{Aiy}\\) represents a rotation in the complex plane due to the imaginary part of \\(A\\). Therefore, \\(f(z)\\) will scale and rotate the complex number \\(z\\).\n\n3. **Contour Integration in Complex Plane**: When integrating a function around a closed contour \\(C\\) in the complex plane, the result can be affected by the behavior of the function along the path. However, the key point here is whether the contour itself changes the result without intervention during the integration process.\n\n4. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**: According to Cauchy's Integral Theorem, if \\(f(z)\\) is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on a simple closed contour \\(C\\), then the integral of \\(f(z)\\) over \\(C\\) is zero. The function \\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane), so it satisfies the conditions of Cauchy's theorem.\n\n5. **Path Independence**: Since \\(f(z)\\) is holomorphic, the value of the integral \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\) depends only on the endpoints of the path \\(C\\) (if \\(C\\) is a closed contour, the endpoints coincide, making the integral zero). The specific path taken in the complex plane does not change this result as long as the function remains analytic throughout the contour.\n\nGiven these points, the contour of integration in the complex plane does not alter the result of \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\) for the function \\(f(z) = e^{Az}\\) where \\(C\\) is a closed contour, because the function is holomorphic and thus the integral over any closed contour is zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
