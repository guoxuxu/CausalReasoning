    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Given Equations**: We have two coupled differential equations:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{x} = Ax + By\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\n   \\]\n\n2. **Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions for \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\) are given and will evolve according to these differential equations.\n\n3. **Laplace Transform**: We need to analyze how the Laplace Transform \\(Z(s)\\) of \\(z(t)\\) is influenced by the initial conditions and the constants \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\).\n\n4. **Laplace Transform of the System**: To find \\(Z(s)\\), we take the Laplace Transform of both differential equations. The Laplace Transform of \\(\\dot{x}\\) and \\(\\dot{y}\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   sX(s) - x(0) = AX(s) + BY(s)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   sY(s) - y(0) = CX(s) + DY(S)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solving for \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\)**: Rearrange these equations to solve for \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\):\n   \\[\n   (s - A)X(s) - BY(s) = x(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   CX(s) + (s - D)Y(s) = y(0)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Matrix Formulation**: This can be written in matrix form as:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n   s - A & -B \\\\\n   C & s - D\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n   X(s) \\\\\n   Y(s)\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   =\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n   x(0) \\\\\n   y(0)\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determinant and Inverse**: For non-singular matrices, the inverse exists if the determinant is non-zero. The determinant is:\n   \\[\n   \\det(sI - M) = (s - A)(s - D) - (-B)(C) = s^2 - (A+D)s + (AD + BC)\n   \\]\n   If the determinant is non-zero, the system is invertible.\n\n8. **Solution for \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\)**: Using Cramer's rule, we get:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\frac{(s - D)x(0) + BCy(0)}{(s - A)(s - D) - BC}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{-Cx(0) + (s - A)y(0)}{(s - A)(s - D) - BC}\n   \\]\n\n9. **Laplace Transform \\(Z(s)\\)**: Since \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s)\n   \\]\n\nFrom the above steps, it is clear that \\(Z(s)\\) depends on the initial conditions \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\) as well as the constants \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\). Therefore, the structure of the resulting Laplace Transform \\(Z(s)\\) does indeed depend on all these factors.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
