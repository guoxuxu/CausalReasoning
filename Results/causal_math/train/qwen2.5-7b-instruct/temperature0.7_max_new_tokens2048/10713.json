Therefore, the imaginary part of \\( Z(s) \\) will not be affected by the changes in \\( u(t) \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, if \\( u(t) \\) is increased linearly over time without modifying \\( v(t) \\), then the transformed \\( Z(s) \\) will reflect changes only in the real part due to \\( u(t) \\), and the imaginary part will remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
