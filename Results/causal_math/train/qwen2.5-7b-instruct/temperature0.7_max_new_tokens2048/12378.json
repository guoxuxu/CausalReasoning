    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an operator \\(L\\) such that \\(Lf = \\lambda f\\), where \\(f\\) is an eigenfunction of \\(L\\) with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n2. **Application of Integral Transform \\(T\\)**: The integral transform \\(T\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   (Tf)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty k(x,t) f(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Applying \\(T\\) to \\(f\\), we get \\(Tf\\).\n\n3. **Application of Integral Transform \\(U\\)**: Another integral transform \\(U\\) is applied to \\(Tf\\):\n   \\[\n   (U(Tf))(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty m(x,s) (Tf)(s) \\, ds\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(m(x,s)\\) is the kernel function for \\(U\\).\n\n4. **Action of Operator \\(L\\)**: Now, we need to determine if \\(L(U(Tf))\\) is an eigenfunction of \\(L\\) with the same eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\).
