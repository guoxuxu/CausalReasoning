The function \\( e^z \\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane).\n\n4. **Implication of Given Information**: Since no transformations have occurred and the integral result is given, and given that \\( e^z \\) is an entire function, the integral over any closed contour should be zero according to Cauchy's theorem.\n\n5. **Uniqueness of the Function**: If the integral result over the closed contour \\( C \\) is known and matches the expected value from Cauchy's theorem (which is 0 for \\( e^z \\)), then the original function \\( f(z) = e^z \\) can indeed be uniquely determined, as no other entire function would yield the same integral result without transformation.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the application of Cauchy's Integral Theorem, we can determine that the original function applied is \\( f(z) = e^z \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Function and Contour**: The function given is \\( f(z) = e^z \\).

According to Cauchy's integral theorem, for an analytic function (which \\( e^z \\) is everywhere in the complex plane), the integral over any closed contour is zero if there are no singularities inside the contour.\n\n3. **Transformations**: The problem specifies that no transformations occurred. This means the function \\( f(z) = e^z \\) was not modified in any way before integration.\n\n4. **Determining the Original Function**: Given only the integral result and knowing no transformations occurred, we need to determine if we can uniquely identify the original function \\( f(z) = e^z \\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness**: In complex analysis, if the integral of a function over every closed contour is zero, the function must be analytic and have no singularities inside those contours. Since \\( e^z \\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane), its integral over any closed contour will indeed be zero, but this property alone does not uniquely determine the function without additional information.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: While the integral result being zero is consistent with the function \\( e^z \\) (given the properties of \\( e^z \\)), it does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the function from just the integral result without knowing more about the specific contour \\( C \\) or having other conditions.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and without additional details, we cannot definitively determine the original function applied solely from the integral result knowing no transformations occurred.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
