    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have an input signal \\( x(t) \\) which undergoes a Laplace transform to give us \\( X(s) \\).\n\n2. **Modulation**: Before applying the Laplace transform, the input signal \\( x(t) \\) is modulated by another function \\( m(t) \\).
