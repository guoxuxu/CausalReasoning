If we consider the time evolution after \\( t_1 \\), the function will be \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega (t - t_1)} \\cdot e^{im\\omega t_1} = e^{i\\omega t - i\\omega t_1 + im\\omega t_1} = e^{i\\omega t + i\\omega (m-1)t_1} \\).\n\n5. **Final State at Time T**: The state of the system at time \\( T \\) will be \\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega T + i\\omega (m-1)t_1} \\). This expression shows that the state at time \\( T \\) depends on both \\( \\omega \\) and the values of \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) through the terms \\( \\omega T \\) and \\( \\omega (m-1)t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the system's state at time \\( T > t_1 \\) is not solely dependent on \\( \\omega \\) irrespective of \\( n \\) or \\( m \\). It also depends on the values of \\( n \\) and \\( m \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
