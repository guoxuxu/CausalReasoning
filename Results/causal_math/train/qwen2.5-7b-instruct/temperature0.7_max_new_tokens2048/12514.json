    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial System**: We start with the system \\( Ax = b \\), where \\( A \\) is an \\( n \\times n \\) matrix, \\( x \\) is an \\( n \\times 1 \\) vector, and \\( b \\) is an \\( n \\times 1 \\) vector.\n\n2. **Pre-multiplication by \\( M \\)**: We then consider the system \\( M(Ax) = Mb \\).

    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the original system of linear equations represented as \\( Ax = b \\).\n2. We introduce a new matrix \\( M \\) which is invertible, and we multiply both sides of the equation by \\( M \\):\n   \\[ M(Ax) = Mb \\]\n3. Since \\( M \\) is invertible, we can apply \\( M^{-1} \\) on both sides of the equation:\n   \\[ A(x) = M^{-1}Mb \\]\n4. Simplifying the right side, we get:\n   \\[ Ax = b \\]\n5.

Applying \\( N^{-1} \\) on both sides:\n   \\[ A(N^{-1}x) = b \\]\n8. Let \\( y = N^{-1}x \\). Then the equation becomes:\n   \\[ Ay = b \\]\n9.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial System**: We start with the system \\(Ax = b\\), where \\(A\\) is an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix, \\(x\\) is the column vector of variables, and \\(b\\) is the column vector of constants.\n\n2. **Applying Matrix \\(M\\)**: When we pre-multiply both sides of the equation by \\(M\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   M(Ax) = Mb\n   \\]\n   This transformation doesn't change the solution set because if \\(x\\) is a solution to \\(Ax = b\\), then \\(M(Ax) = M(b)\\) is satisfied for the same \\(x\\).

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial System**: We start with the system \\(Ax = b\\).\n\n2. **First Transformation**: Pre-multiplying both sides by matrix \\(M\\) gives us \\(M(Ax) = Mb\\).

The equation \\((NM)(Ax) = N(Mb)\\) can be rewritten as \\(Ax = (NM)^{-1}N(Mb)\\).\n\n5. **Simplification**: Let \\(C = (NM)^{-1}N(M)\\). Then the equation becomes \\(Ax = Cb\\).
