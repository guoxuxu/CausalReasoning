The difference is due to the additional contribution from \\( S(x) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the initial condition is different when the source term \\( S(x) \\) is introduced, the temperature distribution at any later time \\( T \\) will also be different compared to the case without the source term.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
