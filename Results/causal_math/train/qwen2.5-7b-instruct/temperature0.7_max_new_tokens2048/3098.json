Let's see how this transformation affects \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{\\alpha t} z(0)\n   \\]\n   Now, applying the differential equation solution:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0) e^{i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n   Combining these two expressions, we get:\n   \\[\n   e^{\\alpha t} z(0) = z(0) e^{i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n   Assuming \\( z(0) \\neq 0 \\), we can divide both sides by \\( z(0) \\):\n   \\[\n   e^{\\alpha t} = e^{i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine if the transformation can be reversed:**\n   For the equality \\( e^{\\alpha t} = e^{i \\omega t} \\) to hold, \\( \\alpha \\) must be purely imaginary (since \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\) and \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) are complex exponentials with different bases unless \\( \\alpha \\) is purely imaginary). Let \\( \\alpha = i \\beta \\), where \\( \\beta \\) is a real constant. Then:\n   \\[\n   e^{i \\beta t} = e^{i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   \\beta = \\omega + 2k\\pi \\quad \\text{(for integer } k)\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( \\alpha \\) must be of the form \\( i (\\omega + 2k\\pi) \\).\n\n4. **Observing \\( z(T) \\):**\n   If we observe \\( z(T) \\) at some time \\( T \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z(0) e^{i \\omega T}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( e^{\\alpha T} \\) is just a scaling factor that doesn't change the phase of \\( z(0) \\), we can determine \\( z(0) \\) up to a phase shift. Specifically:\n   \\[\n   z(0) = z(T) e^{-i \\omega T}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, knowing \\( z(T) \\) allows us to recover \\( z(0) \\) up to a global phase factor, which does not affect the original complex number uniquely.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we can deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) from \\( z(T) \\) without needing to know the specific form of \\( g(z) \\) if we assume no additional information about \\( \\alpha \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
