The Laplace transform of \\( y(t) \\) is \\( Y(s) \\), and similarly for \\( f(t) \\). Applying the Laplace transform to the differential equation yields:\n   \\[\n   s^2 Y(s) + psY(s) + qY(s) = F(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\n3. **Reconstructing \\( f(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\)**: To determine if \\( f(t) \\) can be reconstructed from \\( y(t) \\) alone, we need to consider the relationship between \\( y(t) \\) and \\( f(t) \\).

Without additional information about the system or the initial conditions, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( f(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\) alone.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the system's response \\( y(t) \\) is a combination of the system's behavior and the input \\( f(t) \\), and there is no unique way to isolate \\( f(t) \\) from \\( y(t) \\) without additional information, the answer is no.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
