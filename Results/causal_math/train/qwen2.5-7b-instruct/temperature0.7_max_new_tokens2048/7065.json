    "To determine if applying a Fourier transform to the initial wave profile \\( u(x,0) \\) and then evolving it under the wave equation leads to the same result as directly evolving \\( u(x,0) \\) without the Fourier transform, we need to analyze the properties of the wave equation and the Fourier transform.\n\n1. **Wave Equation Analysis**: The given wave equation is \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\). This equation describes a wave propagating with speed \\(c\\) in one spatial dimension.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Properties**: The Fourier transform of the second derivative of a function with respect to \\(x\\) is proportional to the negative square of the frequency times the Fourier transform of the function itself.

Since it is a first-order linear differential equation, we can solve it using separation of variables or direct integration. The solution is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k,t) = \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-c^2 k^2 t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find the solution in the spatial domain, we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\):\n   \\[\n   u(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k,t)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-c^2 k^2 t}]\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Fourier transform, this can be written as:\n   \\[\n   u(x,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-c^2 k^2 t} e^{i k x} dk\n   \\]\n\n6. **Comparison with Direct Evolution**: Now, consider the case where no Fourier transform is applied. The wave equation is solved directly in the spatial domain:\n   \\[\n   u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} [f(x+ct) + f(x-ct)]\n   \\]\n   where \\(f(x)\\) is the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The key point here is that the Fourier transform method and the direct spatial evolution method should yield the same result for the wave profile at any time \\(t\\), because both methods are mathematically equivalent ways of solving the wave equation. The Fourier transform method simply provides a different way of looking at the same problem, but the underlying physics and the final solution remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To address this question, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Wave Equation and Initial Condition**:\n   - The wave equation is given by \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\).\n   - Let \\(u(x,0)\\) be the initial wave profile at time \\(t=0\\).\n\n2. **Applying the Fourier Transform**:\n   - Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\) yields \\(\\mathcal{F}(u(x,0))\\). This transforms the spatial domain into the frequency domain.\n   - The transformed initial condition can be denoted as \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi,0)\\), where \\(\\xi\\) is the frequency variable.\n\n3. **Solving the Wave Equation in Frequency Domain**:\n   - In the frequency domain, the wave equation simplifies because the second derivative with respect to \\(x\\) becomes multiplication by \\(-\\xi^2\\).\n   - Thus, the solution in the frequency domain for the wave equation is \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi,t) = \\hat{u}(\\xi,0) e^{-i c \\xi t}\\).\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:\n   - To find \\(u(x,t)\\) from \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi,t)\\), we apply the inverse Fourier transform: \n     \\[\n     u(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(\\xi,t)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(\\xi,0) e^{-i c \\xi t}].\n     \\]\n   - Using the properties of the Fourier transform, this can be written as:\n     \\[\n     u(x,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{u}(\\xi,0) e^{i \\xi (x - c t)} d\\xi.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Comparison with Direct Evolution**:\n   - Now, consider evolving \\(u(x,0)\\) directly under the wave equation without any Fourier transform.\n   - The solution to the wave equation in the spatial domain is:\n     \\[\n     u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} [f(x + ct) + f(x - ct)] + \\frac{1}{2c} \\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} g(s) ds,\n     \\]\n     where \\(f(x) = u(x,0)\\) and \\(g(x) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0)\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both methods (applying the Fourier transform and then evolving in the frequency domain, versus directly evolving in the spatial domain) will yield the same result for \\(u(x,t)\\) due to the properties of the Fourier transform and the linearity of the wave equation.\n   - Therefore, the wave profile at time \\(T\\) will be the same whether the Fourier transform is applied initially or not.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
