It scales the weight of \\( z(t) \\) in the integral but does not directly influence the form of \\( z(t) \\) itself.\n- **Parameter \\( d \\)**: The parameter \\( d \\) is part of the exponential term in the transformation \\( S(z) \\). Similar to \\( c \\), it scales the weight of \\( z(t) \\) in its own integral but does not directly influence the form of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe endpoint \\( T(z)(T) \\) depends on the form of \\( z(t) \\) as influenced by the parameters \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The parameters \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) only scale the weight of \\( z(t) \\) in the integral but do not alter the fundamental form of \\( z(t) \\) itself.\n\nTherefore, the resulting affected endpoint \\( T(z)(T) \\) will depend on the original parameters \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) and not on \\( c \\) or \\( d \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
