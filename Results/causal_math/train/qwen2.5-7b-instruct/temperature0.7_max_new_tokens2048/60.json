    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Laplace Transform Application**: The function \\( h(t) \\) is transformed into \\( H(s) \\) using the Laplace transform \\( L \\).

The Laplace transform is invertible under certain conditions, but the multiplication by a matrix \\( A \\) introduces nonlinearity if \\( A \\) is not a scalar multiple of the identity matrix.\n\n5. **Determining \\( h(t) \\)**: Given \\( AH(s) \\), we can first reverse the matrix multiplication by \\( A \\) (assuming \\( A \\) is invertible) to get back to \\( H(s) \\). Then, applying the inverse Laplace transform would theoretically give us \\( h(t) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: However, the crucial point is whether \\( A \\) is invertible. If \\( A \\) is not invertible (i.e., it has a determinant of zero or is singular), we cannot uniquely determine \\( H(s) \\) from \\( AH(s) \\). Therefore, without additional information about \\( A \\), we cannot always determine \\( h(t) \\) with certainty.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

This operation is linear and does not affect the invertibility of the Laplace transform in isolation. However, if \\( A \\) is not the identity matrix, it modifies the form of \\( H(s) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform can recover the original function \\( h(t) \\) from \\( H(s) \\) if \\( A \\) were the identity matrix.

This means:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = L[h(t)]\n   \\]\n   This transformation converts the time-domain function \\( h(t) \\) into the frequency domain function \\( H(s) \\).\n\n2. **Multiplication by Matrix \\( A \\)**: The function \\( H(s) \\) is then modified by multiplying it with a constant matrix \\( A \\):\n   \\[\n   H'(s) = A \\cdot H(s)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( H'(s) \\) represents the modified version of \\( H(s) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To recover \\( h(t) \\), we would need to apply the inverse Laplace transform to \\( H'(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   h'(t) = L^{-1}[H'(s)]\n   \\]\n\n4. **Influence of Matrix \\( A \\)**: The key issue here is the effect of multiplying \\( H(s) \\) by matrix \\( A \\).

The specific form of \\( A \\) will affect the recovery of \\( h(t) \\) when we try to invert the Laplace transform.\n\n5. **Recovery of Original Function**: The inverse Laplace transform \\( L^{-1} \\) aims to map \\( H'(s) \\) back to the time domain.
