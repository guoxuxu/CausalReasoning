    "To determine if the original function \\( x(t) \\) can be exactly determined at all times \\( t \\) by knowing \\( X(s) \\), we need to consider the properties and the nature of the inverse Laplace transform.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transform**: The given transform is the Laplace transform, which maps a function \\( x(t) \\) from the time domain to the complex frequency domain represented by \\( X(s) \\).\n\n2. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To recover \\( x(t) \\) from \\( X(s) \\), we use the inverse Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   x(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{X(s)\\} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\int_{\\gamma - iT}^{\\gamma + iT} e^{st} X(s) ds\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\gamma \\) is a real number such that all singularities of \\( X(s) \\) lie to the left of the line \\( \\Re(s) = \\gamma \\).\n\n3. **Uniqueness and Inverse**: The inverse Laplace transform is unique for functions that satisfy certain conditions (e.g., being analytic in the right half-plane).
