    "To determine if the original states \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\) can be uniquely determined from the observation of \\(z(T)\\) after the transformation by \\(f(z)\\), let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dynamics of \\(z(t)\\):**\n   - The function \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\) evolves according to \\(\\dot{x} = Ax\\) and \\(\\dot{y} = By\\).\n   - This implies that both \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) evolve independently as exponential functions due to the linearity of the system.\n   - Therefore, \\(x(t) = x(0)e^{At}\\) and \\(y(t) = y(0)e^{Bt}\\).\n\n2. **Transformation by \\(f(z)\\):**\n   - The transformation is given by \\(f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) \\, dt\\).\n   - Substituting \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\) into the integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Ct}(x(0)e^{At} + iy(0)e^{Bt}) \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - This can be split into real and imaginary parts:\n     \\[\n     f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Ct}x(0)e^{At} \\, dt + i \\int_0^T e^{Ct}y(0)e^{Bt} \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - Let \\(X(t) = e^{At}\\) and \\(Y(t) = e^{Bt}\\). Then:\n     \\[\n     f(z) = x(0) \\int_0^T e^{(A+C)t} \\, dt + iy(0) \\int_0^T e^{(B+C)t} \\, dt\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluating the Integrals:**\n   - The integrals can be evaluated as:\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^T e^{(A+C)t} \\, dt = \\frac{e^{(A+C)T} - 1}{A+C}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^T e^{(B+C)t} \\, dt = \\frac{e^{(B+C)T} - 1}{B+C}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     f(z) = x(0) \\frac{e^{(A+C)T} - 1}{A+C} + iy(0) \\frac{e^{(B+C)T} - 1}{B+C}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Observing \\(z(T)\\):**\n   - From the definition of \\(z(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     z(T) = x(T) + iy(T) = x(0)e^{AT} + iy(0)e^{BT}\n     \\]\n   - However, \\(z(T)\\) is not directly used in the transformation \\(f(z)\\), but rather the values at each point in the interval \\([0, T]\\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Determination:**\n   - To determine \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\) uniquely, we need to solve the system of equations derived from the integrals.\n   - The equations are linear in \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Re}(f(z)) = x(0) \\frac{e^{(A+C)T} - 1}{A+C}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Im}(f(z)) = y(0) \\frac{e^{(B+C)T} - 1}{B+C}\n     \\]\n   - These are two independent linear equations in two unknowns, which can be solved uniquely if \\(A+C \\neq 0\\) and \\(B+C \\neq 0\\).\n\nSince the system of equations is linear and has a unique solution given the conditions on \\(A+C\\) and \\(B+C\\), the original states \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\) can indeed be uniquely determined from the observation of \\(z(T)\\) after the transformation by \\(f(z)\\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\": \"Yes\"}",

    "To determine if the original states \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\) can be uniquely determined from \\(z(T)\\) after applying the transformation \\(f(z)\\), let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions and Evolution**: The function \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\) evolves according to \\(\\dot{x} = Ax\\) and \\(\\dot{y} = By\\). This means that \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) are solutions to linear differential equations with constant coefficients.\n\n2. **Solution Form**: The solutions for \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   x(t) = e^{At}x(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y(t) = e^{Bt}y(0)\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{At}x(0) + ie^{Bt}y(0)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transformation Application**: The transformation is given by \\(f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Ct}z(t) \\, dt\\). Substituting \\(z(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Ct} (e^{At}x(0) + ie^{Bt}y(0)) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This can be split into two integrals:\n   \\[\n   f(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Ct}e^{At}x(0) \\, dt + i\\int_0^T e^{Ct}e^{Bt}y(0) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Integral Evaluation**: Each integral can be evaluated separately.
