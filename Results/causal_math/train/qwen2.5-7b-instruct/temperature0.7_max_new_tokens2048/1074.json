However, knowing \\(U(k)\\) alone does not provide enough information to determine \\(u(x)\\) completely. The solution to the Helmholtz equation is generally an eigenfunction expansion, and without additional boundary conditions or initial conditions, there could be many solutions corresponding to different eigenfunctions.\n\n5. **Specific Query**: The question asks if we can uniquely determine \\(u(x)\\) at \\(x=0\\) without knowing the initial condition explicitly. Given only \\(U(k)\\), we cannot determine the specific value of \\(u(x)\\) at \\(x=0\\) because the inverse Fourier transform involves integrating over all values of \\(k\\), and the value at a single point does not uniquely determine the entire function.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
