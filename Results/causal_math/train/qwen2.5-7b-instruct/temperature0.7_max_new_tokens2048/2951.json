    "Let's analyze the transformations and their effects on the integral step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Transformation\nThe first transformation is \\( z \\to e^{kt} z \\). This implies that if we have a function \\( f(z) \\), it transforms into \\( f(e^{kt} z) \\). However, when considering the integral \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) around a closed contour \\( C \\), we need to consider how this affects the integral itself.\n\nFor the integral, the key point is that the differential \\( dz \\) also changes under this transformation. If \\( z \\to e^{kt} z \\), then \\( dz \\to e^{kt} dz \\). Therefore, the integral transforms as follows:\n\\[ \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\rightarrow \\int_C f(e^{kt} z) \\cdot e^{kt} dz \\]\n\nSince \\( dz \\) is scaled by \\( e^{kt} \\), the integral becomes:\n\\[ \\int_C f(e^{kt} z) \\cdot e^{kt} dz \\]\n\n### Step 2: Second Transformation\nNow, consider the second transformation \\( f(z) \\to f(e^{lt} z) \\) at a specific time \\( t = t_1 \\). This means that at \\( t = t_1 \\), the function \\( f(z) \\) is replaced by \\( f(e^{lt_1} z) \\).\n\nAfter this transformation, the integral at \\( t = t_1 \\) would be:\n\\[ \\int_C f(e^{lt_1} z) \\cdot e^{kt} dz \\]\n\n### Step 3: Final Integral Analysis\nFor \\( T > t_1 \\), the integral will continue to be affected by the initial transformation \\( z \\to e^{kt} z \\). The integral will now involve both transformations:\n\\[ \\int_C f(e^{lt_1} z) \\cdot e^{kt} dz \\]\n\nThis expression shows that the final value of the integral depends on both the initial transformation parameter \\( k \\) and the second transformation parameter \\( l \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that the final integral involves contributions from both \\( k \\) and \\( l \\), the final value of the integral for \\( T > t_1 \\) cannot be said to depend solely on the initial \\( k \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
