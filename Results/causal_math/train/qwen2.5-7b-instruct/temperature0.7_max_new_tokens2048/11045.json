    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - We have a differential equation governing the position \\( x(t) \\) of a mechanical system.\n   - The goal is to apply the Laplace Transform to \\( x(t) \\), solve in the transformed domain (s-domain), and then apply the inverse Laplace Transform to return to the time domain \\( x(t) \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**:\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( x(t) \\) is denoted as \\( X(s) \\).\n   - For the given differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = 0 \\), applying the Laplace Transform yields:\n     \\[\n     s^2X(s) - sx(0) - \\dot{x}(0) + 2\\zeta\\omega_0(sX(s) - x(0)) + \\omega_0^2X(s) = 0\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this, we get:\n     \\[\n     (s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0s + \\omega_0^2)X(s) = s x(0) + \\dot{x}(0) + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 x(0)\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( X(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     X(s) = \\frac{s x(0) + \\dot{x}(0) + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 x(0)}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0s + \\omega_0^2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solving in the S-Domain**:\n   - The right-hand side of the equation is a known function of \\( s \\).\n   - The denominator \\( s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0s + \\omega_0^2 \\) represents the characteristic equation of the system.\n   - The solution in the s-domain will be a function of \\( s \\) that can be manipulated algebraically.\n\n4. **Applying the Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - Once we have \\( X(s) \\), we apply the inverse Laplace Transform to convert back to the time domain.\n   - The inverse Laplace Transform of \\( X(s) \\) will yield a function \\( x(t) \\) that satisfies the original differential equation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The process of transforming from the time domain to the s-domain, solving, and then transforming back to the time domain should theoretically result in the same function \\( x(t) \\) because the Laplace Transform is a one-to-one transformation for linear time-invariant systems.\n   - Therefore, the solution obtained after these steps should be identical to the original function \\( x(t) \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if applying the Laplace Transform and then its inverse will lead to the original function \\( x(t) \\) without any change, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is a linear integral transform that converts a time-domain function into a complex frequency domain function. For a function \\( x(t) \\), the Laplace Transform \\( X(s) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x(t) e^{-st} dt\n   \\]\n   where \\( s \\) is a complex variable.\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**: Applying the Laplace Transform to the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = 0 \\):\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( \\ddot{x}(t) \\) is \\( s^2 X(s) - sx(0) - \\dot{x}(0) \\)\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( \\dot{x}(t) \\) is \\( sX(s) - x(0) \\)\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( x(t) \\) is simply \\( X(s) \\)\n\n   Substituting these into the differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   s^2 X(s) - sx(0) - \\dot{x}(0) + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 (sX(s) - x(0)) + \\omega_0^2 X(s) = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solving for \\( X(s) \\)**: Rearrange the equation to solve for \\( X(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   (s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 s + \\omega_0^2) X(s) = sx(0) + \\dot{x}(0) + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 x(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\frac{sx(0) + \\dot{x}(0) + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 x(0)}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 s + \\omega_0^2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The next step is to find the inverse Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\{X(s)\\} \\). This involves finding a function \\( x(t) \\) such that when it is transformed into the \\( s \\)-domain using the Laplace Transform, it results in \\( X(s) \\).\n\n5. **Reversing the Process**: If the inverse Laplace Transform is correctly applied, it should yield the original function \\( x(t) \\) because the Laplace Transform and its inverse are bijective operations for functions that satisfy certain conditions (like being piecewise continuous and of exponential order).\n\nGiven that the Laplace Transform and its inverse are well-defined and bijective under appropriate conditions, applying the Laplace Transform followed by its inverse should indeed return the original function \\( x(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
