Let \\( z(0) = z_0 \\), so:\n\\[ z(0) = z_0 \\]\n\\[ z(t) = e^{\\alpha t} z_0 \\]\n\nWe now apply the differential equation to this transformed function:\n\\[ \\dot{z} = i\\omega (e^{\\alpha t} z_0) + \\kappa \\]\n\\[ \\dot{z} = i\\omega e^{\\alpha t} z_0 + \\kappa \\]\n\nThis is a new differential equation:\n\\[ \\dot{z} = i\\omega e^{\\alpha t} z_0 + \\kappa \\]\n\nUsing the integrating factor method again, the integrating factor is \\( e^{-i\\omega e^{\\alpha t} z_0 t} \\). However, this approach does not simplify easily due to the presence of \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Comparison\n\nTo compare the two solutions, we need to check if:\n\\[ e^{i\\omega t} \\left( z_0 - \\kappa \\frac{e^{-i\\omega t} - 1}{i\\omega} \\right) = e^{\\alpha t} z_0 \\]\n\nFor this equality to hold for all \\( t \\), the coefficients must match. However, the term \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\) does not match the form \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\left( z_0 - \\kappa \\frac{e^{-i\\omega t} - 1}{i\\omega} \\right) \\) unless \\( \\alpha = i\\omega \\).\n\nSince \\( \\alpha \\) is generally a different real constant from \\( \\omega \\), the two expressions are not equivalent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe transformation \\( f(z) = e^{\\alpha t} z \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) and allowing it to evolve under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\kappa \\) does not result in the same state as directly evolving \\( z_0 \\) under \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\kappa \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
