    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The function \\( z(t) \\) starts at \\( z(0) = z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Differential Equation**: The function evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\). This is a first-order linear differential equation.\n\n3. **Solution to the Differential Equation**: The general solution to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   This solution can be derived by separation of variables or recognizing it as the form of solutions to such equations.\n\n4. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{f(t)\\}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-2\\pi i \\xi t} dt\n   \\]\n   For our function \\( z(t) = z_0 e^{i\\omega t} \\), we need to find:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z_0 e^{i\\omega t} e^{-2\\pi i \\xi t} dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the exponent:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(\\xi) = z_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - 2\\pi \\xi)t} dt\n   \\]\n   The integral evaluates to a Dirac delta function:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(\\xi) = z_0 \\delta(\\omega - 2\\pi \\xi)\n   \\]\n   This indicates that the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) has a peak at \\( \\xi = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\).\n\n5. **Comparison with Initial Condition**: The Fourier transform of the initial condition \\( z(0) = z_0 \\) (a constant function) would be a constant value across all frequencies:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{z_0\\}(\\xi) = z_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i \\xi t} dt = z_0 \\delta(\\xi)\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Fourier transform of the initial condition is a delta function at \\( \\xi = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\) does not reflect the same frequency spectrum as the initial \\( z_0 \\). Instead, it reflects a peak at \\( \\xi = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
