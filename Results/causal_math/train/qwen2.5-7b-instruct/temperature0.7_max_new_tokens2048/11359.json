    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original System Dynamics**: The system is governed by \\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\), where \\( z \\) evolves with time according to \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\).\n\n2. **Intervention**: At time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention modifies \\( z \\) to \\( z' = e^{-i\\omega t}z \\).

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original System Dynamics**: The system is governed by \\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\).

This implies that the state of the system evolves with time according to this mapping. However, this does not change the fundamental dynamics defined by \\( g(z) \\); it only changes how we express the state.\n\n3. **Intervention at \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention modifies \\( z \\) to \\( z' = e^{-i\\omega t}z \\). This means that at time \\( t_1 \\), the state is adjusted back to what it would have been without the intervening phase shift due to \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**: To determine if the final state at \\( z(T) \\) is solely determined by the original function \\( g(z) \\) without dependency on the initial conditions or the intervention, we need to consider the full evolution from the start to the end.\n\n   - Without the intervention, the state would evolve as \\( z(T) = g^{T-t_1}(z(t_1)) \\).\n   - With the intervention, the state at \\( t_1 \\) is adjusted, but the subsequent evolution still follows the same rule \\( g(z) \\).\n\n5. **Dependency Check**: The key point here is whether the adjustment at \\( t_1 \\) affects the final state independently of the original function. Since the intervention only adjusts the phase but not the magnitude of the state (as long as we consider the same function \\( g(z) \\)), the final state should still be determined by the repeated application of \\( g(z) \\).\n\nGiven these points, the final state at \\( z(T) \\) will indeed be solely determined by the original function \\( g(z) \\) without additional dependencies on the initial conditions or the intervention beyond the initial phase adjustment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.

This means that the state of the system at time \\( t_1 \\) is now \\( z' \\).\n\n3. **Mapping Function**: The system evolves according to the mapping \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\). However, after the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), we need to consider how this mapping affects the state starting from \\( z' \\).\n\n4. **Final State Calculation**:\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the state evolves as \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega (t-t_1)}z' \\).\n   - Substituting \\( z' = e^{-i\\omega t_1}z \\) into the equation, we get \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega (t-t_1)}e^{-i\\omega t_1}z = e^{i\\omega t}z \\).\n\n5. **Applying the Function \\( g(z) \\)**: The function \\( g(z) = z^2 + c \\) is applied to the evolving state \\( z(t) \\). So, for \\( t = T \\), the state is \\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega T}z \\), and applying \\( g \\) gives:\n   \\[\n   g(z(T)) = (e^{i\\omega T}z)^2 + c = e^{i2\\omega T}z^2 + c.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**: The final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on the initial condition \\( z \\) through the term \\( z^2 \\). It also depends on the time \\( T \\) through the phase factor \\( e^{i2\\omega T} \\). Additionally, it depends on the constant \\( c \\).\n\nGiven the above steps, the final state \\( z(T) \\) is not solely determined by the original function \\( g(z) \\) but also depends on the initial conditions and the intervention. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
