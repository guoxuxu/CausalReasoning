    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The given transformation \\( F(g) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t)g(t) dt \\) is an inner product between the functions \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\).\n\n2. **Initial Function**: The initial function \\( g(t) = e^{at} \\).
