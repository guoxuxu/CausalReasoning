This would imply that \\( Tf \\) is also an eigenfunction of \\( L \\) with the same eigenvalue \\( \\lambda \\).\n   - However, since \\( T \\) does not commute with \\( L \\), it means that \\( LTf \\neq \\lambda Tf \\) in general. This non-commutativity can disrupt the eigenfunction property.\n\n4. **Counterexample Consideration**:\n   - To further illustrate, consider a simple case where \\( L \\) is the identity operator (i.e., \\( Lf = f \\)). Here, any function \\( f \\) is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue 1.\n   - Applying \\( T \\) to \\( f \\) gives \\( Tf \\). For \\( Tf \\) to be an eigenfunction of \\( L \\) with eigenvalue 1, we need \\( LTf = Tf \\).
