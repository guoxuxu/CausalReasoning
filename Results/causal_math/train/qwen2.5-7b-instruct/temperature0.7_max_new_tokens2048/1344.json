Therefore, if we know the exact form of the Fourier transform after each operation, we can uniquely identify whether the operation was multiplication by \\( x \\) or differentiation.\n\nThus, we can unambiguously define the sequence or type of operations performed on \\( f(x) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can unambiguously define the sequence or type of operations performed on \\( f(x) \\), let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Given Function**: \\( g(x) = x \\cdot f(x) \\).\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( g(x) \\)**: \n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{g(x)\\}(k) = \\mathcal{F}\\{x \\cdot f(x)\\}(k)\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Fourier transform for multiplication by \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{x \\cdot f(x)\\}(k) = i \\frac{d}{dk} \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k)\n   \\]\n3. **Fourier Transform of \\( f(x) \\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-ikx} dx\n   \\]\n4. **Fourier Derivative**:\n   The Fourier derivative property states that:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{ \\frac{d}{dx} f(x) \\right\\}(k) = 2\\pi i k \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k)\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the given transformations and their implications:\n\n- **Multiplication by \\( x \\)**: This operation transforms as \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{x \\cdot f(x)\\}(k) = i \\frac{d}{dk} \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k) \\).\n- **Differentiation in the Fourier domain**: Differentiating \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k) \\) directly gives \\( i \\frac{d}{dk} \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k) \\).\n\nFrom these properties, we see that multiplying \\( f(x) \\) by \\( x \\) in the spatial domain results in differentiating the Fourier transform of \\( f(x) \\) in the frequency domain. Conversely, differentiating the Fourier transform of \\( f(x) \\) corresponds to multiplying \\( f(x) \\) by \\( ik \\) in the spatial domain.\n\nGiven the equations:\n- \\( g(x) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}\\{g(x)\\}(k) = i \\frac{d}{dk} \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k) \\)\n- \\( f(x) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k) \\)\n- \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{ \\frac{d}{dx} f(x) \\right\\}(k) = 2\\pi i k \\mathcal{F}\\{f(x)\\}(k) \\)\n\nWe can observe that the operations are reversible and distinguishable based on their effects on the Fourier transform. Specifically, the multiplication by \\( x \\) in the spatial domain translates to differentiation in the Fourier domain, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, if we observe the resulting spectrum, we can unambiguously determine whether the original operation was multiplication by \\( x \\) or differentiation, as each operation has a distinct effect on the Fourier transform.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
