If \\( h(\\omega) \\) is non-trivial, it will modify the spectrum in a way that is detectable. Specifically, if \\( h(\\omega) \\) is something other than a simple scaling or phase shift, it will affect the shape of the spectrum around \\( \\omega_0 \\).\n\nGiven that \\( g(\\omega) \\) does not change the spectrum, the presence of \\( h(\\omega) \\) can be detected by looking at the resultant spectrum. Therefore, by inspecting the signal at any frequency \\( \\omega \\), we can determine whether \\( h(\\omega) \\) was applied.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal**: The time-domain signal is given by \\( x(t) = e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\).\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier Transform to \\( x(t) \\) results in \\( X(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function. This means that the signal has all its energy concentrated at the frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\).\n3. **Modulation by \\( g(\\omega) \\)**: Multiplying \\( X(\\omega) \\) by \\( g(\\omega) = e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|} \\) modifies the signal such that its amplitude decreases as the frequency moves away from \\( \\omega_0 \\). The resulting signal in the frequency domain is \\( X(\\omega) \\cdot g(\\omega) = 2\\pi e^{-\\alpha |\\omega - \\omega_0|} \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\).\n4. **Further Modulation by \\( h(\\omega) \\)**: If another function \\( h(\\omega) \\) is applied, the signal becomes \\( X(\\omega) \\cdot g(\\omega) \\cdot h(\\omega) \\).\n\nTo determine if we can conclusively determine whether both \\( g(\\omega) \\) and \\( h(\\omega) \\) were applied just by inspecting the signal at any frequency \\( \\omega \\):\n\n- At any frequency \\( \\omega \\neq \\omega_0 \\), the signal will be zero due to the presence of the Dirac delta function.\n- At \\( \\omega = \\omega_0 \\), the signal will be non-zero only if \\( h(\\omega_0) \\neq 0 \\).\n\nHowever, the application of \\( g(\\omega) \\) is already evident because it modifies the signal in a way that its amplitude decreases as the frequency moves away from \\( \\omega_0 \\). Therefore, even without knowing \\( h(\\omega) \\), we can see the effect of \\( g(\\omega) \\) just by looking at the signal around \\( \\omega_0 \\).\n\nGiven this, we cannot conclusively determine whether \\( h(\\omega) \\) was applied just by inspecting the signal at any frequency \\( \\omega \\), because \\( h(\\omega) \\) could be a constant (or non-zero at \\( \\omega_0 \\)) which would not change the signal's behavior significantly when only the presence of \\( g(\\omega) \\) is considered.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
