This is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation. Its solution is given by:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z_0 e^{-kt}\n   \\]\n   where \\( z_0 \\) is the initial condition at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   We need to find the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z_0 e^{-kt} dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this integral:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = z_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(k + i\\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges only for \\( k + i\\omega > 0 \\), which implies that \\( \\text{Re}(k + i\\omega) > 0 \\). Assuming this condition is met, we get:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = \\frac{z_0}{k + i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(T) \\)**:\n   At time \\( T \\), the function \\( z(T) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z_0 e^{-kT}\n   \\]\n   The Fourier transform of \\( z(T) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   F(z(T))(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z_0 e^{-kT} dt = z_0 e^{-kT} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n   However, the integral \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\) does not converge in the usual sense.

    "To determine if we can accurately deduce the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) from the Fourier spectrum of \\( z(T) \\) at time \\( T \\) without knowing the system's history, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation:**\n   The given differential equation is \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = -kz \\). This is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation with a constant coefficient. The solution to this equation is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z_0 e^{-kt}\n   \\]\n   where \\( z_0 \\) is the initial condition at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of the Solution:**\n   We need to find the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\omega t} z_0 e^{-kt} \\, dt = z_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-(k + i\\omega)t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   The integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-(k + i\\omega)t} \\, dt = \\frac{1}{k + i\\omega}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the Fourier transform is:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = \\frac{z_0}{k + i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate at Time T:**\n   At time \\( T \\), the Fourier transform of \\( z(T) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   F(z(T))(\\omega) = \\frac{z_0}{k + i\\omega}\n   \\]\n   This expression does not depend on \\( T \\) explicitly but rather on the initial condition \\( z_0 \\).\n\n4. **Deduce Initial Condition:**\n   To deduce \\( z_0 \\) from \\( F(z(T))(\\omega) \\), we need to consider the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left[ \\frac{z_0}{k + i\\omega} \\right](T)\n   \\]\n   The inverse Fourier transform of \\( \\frac{1}{k + i\\omega} \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{k} e^{kt} \\).
