    "To determine whether we can deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) after observing \\( g(z) \\) with a specific \\( s \\), let's break down the given information and analyze it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Given Function Transformation:**\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t, z) dt\n   \\]\n   And the specific form of \\( f(t, z) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   f(t, z) = t^k z\n   \\]\n\n2. **Substitute \\( f(t, z) \\) into the Integral:**\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (t^k z) dt = z \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^k dt\n   \\]\n   The integral \\(\\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^k dt\\) is a known form and can be evaluated using the Gamma function:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^k dt = s^{-(k+1)} \\Gamma(k+1)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\Gamma(k+1)\\) is the Gamma function evaluated at \\(k+1\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the Expression for \\( g(z) \\):**\n   \\[\n   g(z) = z \\cdot s^{-(k+1)} \\Gamma(k+1)\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = z \\cdot C\n   \\]\n   where \\( C = s^{-(k+1)} \\Gamma(k+1) \\) is a constant depending on \\( s \\) and \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Determine \\( z \\) from \\( g(z) \\):**\n   From the equation \\( g(z) = z \\cdot C \\), if we know \\( g(z) \\) and \\( C \\), we can solve for \\( z \\):\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{g(z)}{C}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( C \\) is determined by \\( s \\) and \\( k \\), and these parameters are known when we observe \\( g(z) \\), we can compute \\( z \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If we observe \\( g(z) \\) and know the values of \\( s \\) and \\( k \\), we can determine \\( z \\).\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), the value of \\( f(t, z) \\) is \\( f(0, z) = 0^k z = 0 \\) (for \\( k > 0 \\)), which does not provide any information about \\( z \\) directly.\n   - However, since we have the relationship \\( g(z) = z \\cdot C \\), we can deduce \\( z \\) from \\( g(z) \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can deduce the original complex number \\( z_0 \\) from \\( g(z) \\) with a specific \\( s \\) and \\( k \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
