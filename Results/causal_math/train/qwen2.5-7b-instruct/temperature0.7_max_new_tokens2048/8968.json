However, determining the initial condition from the final state is generally an ill-posed problem. In other words, small changes in the final state can lead to large changes in the initial state, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact history of the system.\n\n4. **Interventions**: If there were additional terms in the PDE (such as a potential term \\(k(x, y)\\)), these would affect the evolution of \\(z(t)\\).
