However, the question asks if \\( I(z) \\) will yield a real number exclusively dependent on \\( B \\).\n\nSince \\( I(z) = T \\) is a constant and does not depend on \\( B \\), the answer to the question is no.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding \\(z(t)\\):**\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{(iA + B)t}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit, and \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are real constants. The expression can be expanded using Euler's formula:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{(iA + B)t} = e^{Bt} \\cdot e^{iAt} = e^{Bt} (\\cos(At) + i\\sin(At))\n   \\]\n\n2. **Integral Transformation \\(I(z)\\):**\n   \\[\n   I(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-(iA + B)t} z(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Substitute \\(z(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   I(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-(iA + B)t} \\cdot e^{Bt} (\\cos(At) + i\\sin(At)) dt\n   \\]\n   Simplify the exponentials:\n   \\[\n   I(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-itA} (\\cos(At) + i\\sin(At)) dt\n   \\]\n   Separate the integral into real and imaginary parts:\n   \\[\n   I(z) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-itA} \\cos(At) dt + i \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-itA} \\sin(At) dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the Real Part:**\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-itA} \\cos(At) dt\n   \\]\n   Use the identity \\(e^{-itA} = \\cos(-tA) - i\\sin(-tA) = \\cos(tA) + i\\sin(tA)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{T} (\\cos(tA) + i\\sin(tA)) \\cos(At) dt\n   \\]\n   Separate into real and imaginary parts:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{T} \\cos^2(tA) dt + i \\int_{0}^{T} \\cos(tA) \\sin(tA) dt\n   \\]\n   The second integral (imaginary part) evaluates to zero due to symmetry over the interval \\([0, T]\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate the Imaginary Part:**\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-itA} \\sin(At) dt\n   \\]\n   Similarly, use the identity \\(e^{-itA} = \\cos(tA) + i\\sin(tA)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{T} (\\cos(tA) + i\\sin(tA)) \\sin(At) dt\n   \\]\n   Separate into real and imaginary parts:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{T} \\cos(tA) \\sin(At) dt + i \\int_{0}^{T} \\sin^2(tA) dt\n   \\]\n   The first integral (real part) evaluates to zero due to symmetry over the interval \\([0, T]\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Since both the real and imaginary parts of the integrals evaluate to zero or cancel out, the result is purely imaginary. Therefore, \\(I(z)\\) does not yield a real number exclusively dependent on \\(B\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
