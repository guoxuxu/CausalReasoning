  "Question Type": "from cause to effect with intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "The intervention changes the decay rate of the system, which significantly alters the spectral characteristics of the system at time T. The frequency response calculated through the Fourier transform is directly dependent on the total decay rate \\\\( k+m \\\\), hence it varies with m.",
  "causal_map": "k → dz/dt; m → dz/dt; dz/dt → z(T); k+m → dz/dt; T > t1 → z(T)",
