    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial System Description**: We have a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) governed by the differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant matrices. This means that \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) evolve according to linear systems with constant coefficients.\n\n2. **Fourier Transformation**: The Fourier transform \\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t}z(t) dt \\) is applied to this system. This transformation converts the time-domain representation of \\( z(t) \\) into a frequency-domain representation, highlighting the spectral components of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Additional Transformation**: At time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( G(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{Ct}z(t) dt \\) is applied, where \\( C \\) is a constant matrix. This transformation modifies \\( z(t) \\) by applying an exponential factor.\n\n4. **Impact on Spectrum**: To determine if the spectrum \\( F(z) \\) at time \\( t > t_1 \\) solely depends on the transformations by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we need to consider how each transformation affects the spectrum.\n\n   - **Transformation by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**: These transformations affect the behavior of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) in the time domain, which in turn affects their spectral components as seen in \\( F(z) \\). Since \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constant, they do not change over time and thus their effect on the spectrum is consistent.\n   \n   - **Transformation by \\( G(z) \\)**: The transformation \\( G(z) \\) introduces a new term \\( e^{Ct} \\) to the integral. This term is applied at \\( t = t_1 \\) and modifies the function \\( z(t) \\) from that point onward. However, it does not directly modify the original differential equations governing \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\). Instead, it modifies the function \\( z(t) \\) itself, but the spectral analysis still relies on the underlying dynamics defined by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While the transformation \\( G(z) \\) changes the form of \\( z(t) \\) after \\( t_1 \\), the spectral analysis of \\( F(z) \\) at \\( t > t_1 \\) will still reflect the dynamics described by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), because the Fourier transform essentially captures the frequency content of the signals generated by these dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum \\( F(z) \\) at time \\( t > t_1 \\) will indeed depend on the transformations by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), even though \\( G(z) \\) introduces a modification at \\( t_1 \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
