However, this does not provide any information about the value of \\( z(0) \\) directly, as \\( z(0) \\) is inherently zero due to the nature of the integral transformation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The initial condition \\( z(0) \\) is always zero for the given transformation, independent of the behavior of \\( u(s) \\) over the interval [0, T1].\n   - Therefore, observing \\( z(T1) \\) does not affect the determination of \\( z(0) \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the initial state \\( z(0) \\) can indeed be uniquely determined as 0 without needing any additional information about \\( u(s) \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
