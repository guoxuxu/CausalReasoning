    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to understand how multiplying a signal \\(x(t)\\) by a complex exponential \\(e^{2\\pi i f_0 t}\\) affects its continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Properties**: One important property of the Fourier transform is that multiplying a function by a complex exponential in the time domain corresponds to a shift in the frequency domain. Specifically, if \\(x(t) \\leftrightarrow X(f)\\), then \\(x(t)e^{2\\pi i f_0 t} \\leftrightarrow X(f - f_0)\\).\n\n3. **Applying the Property**: When we multiply \\(x(t)\\) by \\(e^{2\\pi i f_0 t}\\), the resulting signal becomes \\(x(t)e^{2\\pi i f_0 t}\\). According to the Fourier transform property mentioned above, this multiplication results in a shift of the spectrum \\(X(f)\\) by \\(f_0\\).\n\n4. **Frequency Shift**: The shift in the frequency domain means that every frequency component in \\(X(f)\\) is shifted by \\(f_0\\). There are no additional changes; it's a pure frequency shift.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the properties of the Fourier transform, the spectrum \\(X(f)\\) will indeed shift by \\(f_0\\) in frequency without any additional modifications.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n   - We have a signal \\( x(t) \\) with its continuous-time Fourier transform (CTFT) \\( X(f) \\).\n   - The signal is modified to \\( x(t)e^{2\\pi i f_0 t} \\), where \\( f_0 \\) is a frequency offset.\n   - We need to determine if the CTFT of the modified signal results in a simple shift of the original spectrum \\( X(f) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Properties**:\n   - One of the key properties of the Fourier Transform is the time-shift property. For a signal \\( x(t) \\) with CTFT \\( X(f) \\), shifting the signal in time by \\( \\tau \\) results in multiplying the CTFT by \\( e^{-2\\pi i f \\tau} \\).\n   - However, in this case, we are not shifting the signal in time but multiplying it by a complex exponential in the time domain.\n\n3. **Effect of Multiplication by Complex Exponential**:\n   - Multiplying \\( x(t) \\) by \\( e^{2\\pi i f_0 t} \\) can be seen as a phase modulation of the signal.\n   - In the frequency domain, this operation corresponds to a circular shift of the spectrum \\( X(f) \\).\n\n4. **Circular Shift in Frequency Domain**:\n   - Specifically, multiplying \\( x(t) \\) by \\( e^{2\\pi i f_0 t} \\) in the time domain results in a circular (or periodic) shift of the spectrum \\( X(f) \\) by \\( f_0 \\).\n   - This means that the spectrum does not simply shift linearly but wraps around periodically due to the nature of the Fourier Transform.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the spectrum does shift, it undergoes a circular shift rather than a simple linear shift. Therefore, the statement that the spectrum shifts by \\( f_0 \\) without any additional changes is not entirely accurate.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
