This suggests that the temperature \\(u\\) is scaled by a factor that depends on both time \\(t\\) and a constant \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n3. **Observing \\(u(t)\\) at Time \\(T\\)**: We observe the temperature \\(u(t)\\) at some later time \\(T\\). However, this observation includes the effect of the thermal control method \\(f(u)\\).\n\n4. **Reversing the Thermal Control Effect**: To determine the original state \\(u_0\\) at \\(t = 0\\), we need to reverse the effect of \\(f(u)\\). Since \\(f(u) = e^{\\alpha t}u\\), applying the inverse transformation would be:\n   \\[\n   u(t) \\rightarrow u(t) / e^{\\alpha t}\n   \\]\n   At time \\(T\\), this becomes:\n   \\[\n   u(T) / e^{\\alpha T}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Uniquely Determining \\(u_0\\)**: If we can apply the inverse transformation correctly, we should be able to recover \\(u_0\\) from \\(u(T)\\). The key here is whether the thermal control method \\(f(u)\\) affects the solution in a way that makes it non-unique or ambiguous.\n\n6. **Analysis**:\n   - The thermal control method scales the temperature uniformly at each point in space.\n   - Reversing this scaling by dividing by \\(e^{\\alpha T}\\) should give us the original temperature distribution \\(u_0\\).\n\nGiven these steps, if we know the form of the thermal control method and can apply its inverse, we can indeed uniquely determine the original state \\(u_0\\) at \\(t = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
