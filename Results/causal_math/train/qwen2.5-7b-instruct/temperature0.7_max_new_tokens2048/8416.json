Since \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), we have \\( w(t) = Ae^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of the Modified Function:**\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( w(t) \\) is given by \\( Z(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}(w(t)) \\).\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), where \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the frequency of the exponential function.\n   - Therefore, \\( Z(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}(Ae^{i\\omega t}) \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Matrix \\( A \\):**\n   - The matrix \\( A \\) acts on the exponential term. If \\( A \\) is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues \\( \\lambda_i \\), it scales the exponential function by these eigenvalues.\n   - For simplicity, assume \\( A \\) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, i.e., \\( A = \\alpha I \\), where \\( \\alpha \\) is a scalar and \\( I \\) is the identity matrix.\n   - Then, \\( w(t) = \\alpha e^{i\\omega t} \\), and the Fourier Transform \\( Z(\\omega) = \\alpha \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\).\n\n5. **Determining \\( A \\):**\n   - From the above, if \\( A \\) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, we can determine \\( \\alpha \\) from the amplitude of \\( Z(\\omega) \\).\n   - However, if \\( A \\) is not a simple scalar multiple of the identity matrix, determining \\( A \\) exactly from \\( Z(\\omega) \\) would be more complex and may require additional information about the structure of \\( A \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - In general, without additional information about the form of \\( A \\), it is not always possible to uniquely determine \\( A \\) from \\( Z(\\omega) \\) alone. The Fourier Transform only captures the scaling effect of \\( A \\) on the exponential function, but does not provide enough information to reconstruct the full matrix \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the nature of the Fourier Transform, we cannot definitively determine the specific matrix \\( A \\) used to modify \\( z(t) \\) before taking the Fourier Transform.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
