This suggests that the effect of the source diminishes over time due to the exponential factor \\( e^{-\\lambda t} \\).\n\n3. **Initial and Boundary Conditions**:\n   To solve this PDE, we would typically need initial conditions (e.g., \\( u(x, 0) \\)) and boundary conditions (e.g., \\( u(0, t) \\), \\( u(L, t) \\) for a one-dimensional rod of length \\( L \\)).\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Solution**:\n   For the heat equation, if the initial condition and boundary conditions are fixed, the solution is unique. However, the presence of the source term complicates this uniqueness because it introduces additional influence on the solution.\n\n5. **Effect of Source Over Time**:\n   Given the form of \\( h(t, x) \\), the source has a diminishing impact as \\( t \\) increases.

However, since the source decays exponentially, the contribution from earlier times will dominate initially but diminish over time.\n\n7. **Determining the Source**:\n   To determine whether the source was applied from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( T \\), we would need to know the exact form of \\( u(x, T) \\) and compare it to the solution without the source. However, even with knowledge of \\( u(x, T) \\), the inverse problem of determining the exact history of the source from a single snapshot is generally ill-posed due to the smoothing effect of the diffusion process.\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   While the temperature profile \\( u(x, T) \\) does contain information about the source, it does not provide enough detail to uniquely determine the history of the source from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( T \\).
