    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Integral**: The original integral is \\(\\int_C e^{az} dz\\).\n\n2. **Affine Transformation**: An affine transformation \\(g(z) = bz + c\\) is applied to each point on path \\(C\\). This transforms the path \\(C\\) into a new path \\(C'\\).\n\n3. **Transformed Function**: The function \\(f(z) = e^{az}\\) is now evaluated along the transformed path \\(C'\\), resulting in \\(e^{a(g(z))} = e^{a(bz + c)}\\).\n\n4. **New Integral**: The transformed integral is \\(\\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz = \\int_{C'} e^{a(bz + c)} dz\\).\n\n5. **Substitution in the New Integral**: To understand if this integral is independent of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), we need to consider how the integral changes under these transformations.\n\n6. **Change of Variables**: Let's perform a change of variables in the new integral. Set \\(w = bz + c\\). Then \\(dw = bdz\\), and the limits of integration also change accordingly. However, the key insight here is that the form of the integrand \\(e^{a(bz + c)}\\) depends on \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\).\n\n7. **Independence Analysis**:\n   - The parameter \\(a\\) clearly affects the exponential term.\n   - The parameter \\(b\\) scales the argument of the exponential, affecting the rate of growth or decay.\n   - The parameter \\(c\\) shifts the entire exponential function, but does not change its fundamental dependence on \\(a\\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Since the integral \\(\\int_{C'} e^{a(bz + c)} dz\\) still depends on \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in its integrand, it cannot be independent of these parameters.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Integral**: The original integral is given by \\( \\int_C e^{az} dz \\).\n\n2. **Affine Transformation**: An affine transformation \\( g(z) = bz + c \\) is applied to each point on the path \\( C \\) to get a new path \\( C' \\). This means that every point \\( z \\) on \\( C \\) is mapped to a new point \\( g(z) = bz + c \\) on \\( C' \\).\n\n3. **Transformed Function**: The function \\( e^{az} \\) transforms under the affine transformation as \\( e^{a(g(z))} = e^{a(bz + c)} = e^{abz + ac} \\).\n\n4. **Transformed Integral**: The integral over the new path \\( C' \\) becomes \\( \\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz = \\int_{C'} e^{abz + ac} dz \\).\n\n5. **Change of Variables**: To understand the independence of the integral from \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\), we can use a change of variables. Let \\( w = g(z) = bz + c \\). Then \\( dw = b dz \\), and the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{C'} e^{abz + ac} dz = \\int_C e^{abw - abc + ac} \\frac{dw}{b} = \\frac{1}{b} \\int_C e^{abw} dw.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Simplification**: Notice that the term \\( e^{ac} \\) is a constant with respect to \\( w \\) and can be factored out. Also, the integral \\( \\int_C e^{abw} dw \\) is the same form as the original integral but scaled by a factor of \\( 1/b \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The transformed integral depends on \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) through the scaling factor \\( 1/b \\). It also depends on \\( c \\) through the constant term \\( e^{ac} \\). Therefore, the transformed integral is not independent of the parameters \\( a, b, \\) and \\( c \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
