    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Convolution**: The given system performs a convolution of the input signal \\( x(t) \\) with the modulating function \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\).

Since \\( H(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha + j\\omega} \\) is never zero for any real \\( \\omega \\), theoretically, this division should work.\n\n5. **Practical Considerations**: In practice, if there are noise or other distortions in the measured \\( Y(\\omega) \\), or if the frequency range of interest is not fully captured, exact recovery might not be possible. Additionally, the inverse Fourier transform must be applied correctly to get back to the time domain.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the mathematical properties and assuming no practical limitations like noise or incomplete data, it is indeed possible to exactly infer the original signal \\( x(t) \\) from \\( Y(\\omega) \\) if \\( H(\\omega) \\) is known and non-zero.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
