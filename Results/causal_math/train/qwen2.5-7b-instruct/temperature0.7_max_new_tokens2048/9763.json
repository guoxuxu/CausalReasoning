This function undergoes a Laplace transform, resulting in \\(Z(s)\\).\n\n2. **Multiplication by \\(e^{at}\\)**: Before applying the Laplace transform, we multiply \\(z(t)\\) by \\(e^{at}\\). This transforms the function to \\(z(t)e^{at} = e^{at}(u(t) + iv(t))\\). The Laplace transform of this modified function is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)e^{at}\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at}(u(t) + iv(t))\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the time-shifting property of the Laplace transform, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at}f(t)\\} = F(s-a)\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)e^{at}\\} = Z(s-a)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention with \\(e^{bt}\\)**: At \\(t = t_1\\), we introduce an additional multiplication by \\(e^{bt}\\). This means the function now becomes \\(z(t_1)e^{at}e^{bt}\\delta(t-t_1)\\), where \\(\\delta(t-t_1)\\) is the Dirac delta function representing the impulse at \\(t = t_1\\). The Laplace transform of this function is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t_1)e^{at}e^{bt}\\delta(t-t_1)\\} = z(t_1)e^{at_1}e^{bt_1} \\cdot 1 = z(t_1)e^{(a+b)t_1}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(Z(s)\\) represents the Laplace transform of \\(z(t)e^{at}\\), we can express \\(z(t_1)e^{at_1}\\) as \\(Z(a)\\) evaluated at \\(t = t_1\\). Thus, the Laplace transform after the intervention is:\n   \\[\n   Z(a + b)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**: The ultimate Laplace transform \\(Z(s)\\) depends on the value of \\(s\\) which is shifted by both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).
