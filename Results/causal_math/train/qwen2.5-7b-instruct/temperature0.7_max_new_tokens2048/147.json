    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\) describes how the temperature \\(u(x,t)\\) changes over time due to thermal diffusion.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying a Fourier transform to the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\) converts the spatial domain problem into a frequency domain problem. In the frequency domain, the heat equation becomes a simple first-order differential equation in time.\n\n3. **Gaussian Filter in Frequency Domain**: At time \\(t_1\\), a Gaussian filter is applied in the frequency domain. This means that the solution \\(U(k,t)\\) (in the frequency domain) is modified by multiplying it with a Gaussian function.\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To get back to the spatial domain, we take the inverse Fourier transform of the modified solution. The modified solution now includes the effect of the Gaussian filter.\n\n5. **Dependence on the Filter**: The key point here is that the filter modifies the frequency components of the solution. When we evolve this modified solution forward in time using the heat equation, the filter remains part of the solution because the heat equation does not \"undo\" the frequency domain filtering.\n\n6. **Final Temperature Profile**: Therefore, the temperature profile at any later time \\(t = T\\) (where \\(T > t_1\\)) will indeed depend on both the original heat equation and the filter applied at \\(t_1\\). The filter modifies the initial condition in the frequency domain, which then influences the solution as it evolves over time according to the heat equation.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Applying a Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) to both sides of the heat equation gives us a transformed version that is easier to solve.\n\n2. **Transformed Heat Equation**: In the frequency domain, the heat equation transforms into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time. Specifically, if \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( u(x,t) \\), then the transformed equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -k k^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   This ODE can be solved directly with the initial condition \\( \\hat{u}(k,0) \\), which is the Fourier transform of the initial temperature distribution \\( u(x,0) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention with Gaussian Filter**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a Gaussian filter is applied in the frequency domain.

Therefore, the temperature profile at any later time \\( T > t_1 \\) will depend not only on the original heat equation but also on the effect of the Gaussian filter applied at \\( t_1 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the Gaussian filter alters the frequency components of the temperature distribution, it affects the subsequent evolution of the temperature profile according to the heat equation.

A Gaussian filter in the frequency domain corresponds to a convolution with a Gaussian function in the spatial domain.
