    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The given function is \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\), where \\( a \\) is a complex constant and \\( z \\) is a complex variable. In the context of the Laplace transform, we typically deal with real-valued functions of a real variable \\( t \\). Therefore, let's consider \\( f(t) = e^{at} \\), where \\( t \\) is a real variable representing time.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Definition**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( f(t) = e^{at} \\), the Laplace transform is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at}\\}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{at} \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(a-s)t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluating the Integral**: To evaluate this integral, we need to consider the condition under which it converges. The integral converges if the real part of \\( s-a \\) is positive, i.e., \\( \\Re(s-a) > 0 \\). Assuming this condition is met, the integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at}\\}(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(a-s)t}}{-(s-a)} \\right]_0^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{s-a}\n   \\]\n   provided that \\( \\Re(s-a) > 0 \\).\n\n4. **Poles of the Laplace Transform**: The expression \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) has a simple pole at \\( s = a \\). However, the question mentions a pole at \\( s = -a \\). This suggests a misinterpretation since the actual pole location should be \\( s = a \\) for the given function \\( e^{at} \\).\n\n5. **Growth Rate Analysis**: The growth rate of the time-domain function \\( e^{at} \\) is indeed dictated by the constant \\( a \\). Specifically, the real part of \\( a \\) determines the growth (if positive) or decay (if negative) rate of the function.
