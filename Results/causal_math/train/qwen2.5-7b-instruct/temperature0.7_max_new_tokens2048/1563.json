    "To determine if the resultant voltage \\( v(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the parameters \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) and not on the constants \\( s \\) or \\( k \\), let's analyze the given system step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Differential Equation\nThe differential equation governing the circuit is:\n\\[ \\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\alpha \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\beta v = 0 \\]\n\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. The general solution to this equation can be found using the characteristic equation:\n\\[ r^2 + \\alpha r + \\beta = 0 \\]\nThe roots of this equation are:\n\\[ r = \\frac{-\\alpha \\pm \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 - 4\\beta}}{2} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Transformations\nWe have two transformations applied to the voltage \\( v(t) \\):\n1. \\( g(v) = e^{st}v \\)\n2. \\( h(v) = e^{kt}v \\)\n\nApplying these transformations, we get new functions of \\( v(t) \\):\n- For \\( g(v) \\): \\( g(v) = e^{st}v \\)\n- For \\( h(v) \\): \\( h(v) = e^{kt}v \\)\n\nAt time \\( t_1 \\), the second transformation \\( h(v) \\) is applied. This means that after \\( t_1 \\), the voltage \\( v(t) \\) is modified by \\( e^{kt} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Effect of Transformations on the Solution\nLet's denote the original solution to the differential equation as \\( v(t) \\). The transformed voltage after applying \\( g(v) \\) is:\n\\[ v_g(t) = e^{st}v(t) \\]\n\nAfter applying \\( h(v) \\) at \\( t_1 \\), the voltage becomes:\n\\[ v_h(t) = e^{kt}v(t) \\text{ for } t > t_1 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Dependence on Parameters\nThe original differential equation's solution \\( v(t) \\) depends on the parameters \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\). The transformations \\( e^{st} \\) and \\( e^{kt} \\) introduce exponential terms that modify the amplitude of the solution but do not change the form of the solution itself.\n\nFor \\( t > t_1 \\), the voltage \\( v(T) \\) is:\n\\[ v(T) = e^{k(T-t_1)}e^{st_1}v(t_1) \\]\n\nSince \\( v(t_1) \\) itself is determined by the initial conditions and the parameters \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\), the exponential term \\( e^{k(T-t_1)} \\) and the constant \\( e^{st_1} \\) do not affect the fundamental dependence on \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe resultant voltage \\( v(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will still depend on the parameters \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) because the transformations \\( e^{st} \\) and \\( e^{kt} \\) only scale the solution but do not alter the underlying behavior dictated by \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the resultant voltage \\( v(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the parameters \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) and not on \\( s \\) or \\( k \\), we need to analyze how these transformations affect the differential equation and the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**:\n   The original differential equation governing the circuit is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\alpha \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\beta v = 0\n   \\]\n   This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\n2. **Transformation \\( g(v) = e^{st}v \\)**:\n   Applying the transformation \\( g(v) = e^{st}v \\), we substitute \\( v(t) \\) with \\( e^{st}v(t) \\). Let's denote the transformed voltage as \\( w(t) = e^{st}v(t) \\).\n   \n   To find the new differential equation for \\( w(t) \\):\n   - \\( \\frac{dw}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{st}v) = se^{st}v + e^{st}\\frac{dv}{dt} = e^{st}(s v + \\frac{dv}{dt}) \\)\n   - \\( \\frac{d^2w}{dt^2} = \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{st}(s v + \\frac{dv}{dt})) = se^{st}(s v + \\frac{dv}{dt}) + e^{st}(s\\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{d^2v}{dt^2}) = e^{st}(s^2 v + 2s \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{d^2v}{dt^2}) \\)\n\n   Substituting these into the original differential equation:\n   \\[\n   e^{st}(s^2 v + 2s \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{d^2v}{dt^2}) + \\alpha e^{st}(s v + \\frac{dv}{dt}) + \\beta e^{st} v = 0\n   \\]\n   Factoring out \\( e^{st} \\):\n   \\[\n   s^2 v + 2s \\frac{dv}{dt} + \\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + \\alpha (s v + \\frac{dv}{dt}) + \\beta v = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2v}{dt^2} + (2s + \\alpha) \\frac{dv}{dt} + (s^2 + \\alpha s + \\beta) v = 0\n   \\]\n   This shows that the transformation introduces terms involving \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Additional Transformation \\( h(v) = e^{kt}v \\)**:\n   Applying the additional transformation \\( h(v) = e^{kt}v \\) at time \\( t_1 \\):\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\), the system follows the original dynamics.\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), the voltage becomes \\( v(t_1) \\rightarrow e^{kt_1}v(t_1) \\).\n\n   The effect of \\( h(v) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) does not change the form of the differential equation but modifies the initial conditions. Specifically, the new initial condition at \\( t_1 \\) would be \\( v(t_1) \\rightarrow e^{kt_1}v(t_1) \\).\n\n4. **Dependence on Parameters**:\n   The solution to the differential equation depends on the characteristic equation derived from the coefficients \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\). The transformations \\( g(v) \\) and \\( h(v) \\) introduce additional terms involving \\( s \\) and \\( k \\), but they do not fundamentally alter the dependence on \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe resultant voltage \\( v(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will still depend on the parameters \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) because these parameters govern the natural behavior of the system described by the differential equation. The transformations \\( g(v) \\) and \\( h(v) \\) modify the system's behavior but do not eliminate the dependency on \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
