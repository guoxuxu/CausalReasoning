    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the given Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\frac{1}{s - P}\n   \\]\n   where \\( P \\) is a complex constant.\n\n2.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Given Transformation**: We have the Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\) given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(u)(s) = \\frac{1}{s - P}\n   \\]\n   where \\( P \\) is a complex constant.\n\n2. **Modification Function**: The modification function \\( v(t) = t^k u(t) \\) is applied at \\( t = 0 \\). The Laplace transform of \\( v(t) \\) can be found using the frequency-domain differentiation property of the Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(t^k u(t)) = (-1)^k \\frac{d^k}{ds^k} \\left( \\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\right)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given \\( \\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(v)(s) = (-1)^k \\frac{d^k}{ds^k} \\left( \\frac{1}{s - P} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention Function**: Another function \\( w(t) = t^m u(t) \\) is applied as an intervention at \\( t = 0 \\). Similarly, we use the frequency-domain differentiation property to find the Laplace transform of \\( w(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(w)(s) = (-1)^m \\frac{d^m}{ds^m} \\left( \\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\right)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given \\( \\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(w)(s) = (-1)^m \\frac{d^m}{ds^m} \\left( \\frac{1}{s - P} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**: We need to determine if \\( \\mathcal{L}(w)(s) \\) depends only on \\( P \\) and not on other factors. From the expression above:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(w)(s) = (-1)^m \\frac{d^m}{ds^m} \\left( \\frac{1}{s - P} \\right)\n   \\]\n   This expression clearly shows that \\( \\mathcal{L}(w)(s) \\) is solely determined by the form of \\( \\mathcal{L}(u)(s) \\) and the value of \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, the transformation \\( \\mathcal{L}(w)(s) \\) for any \\( s \\) depends only on the original \\( P \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
