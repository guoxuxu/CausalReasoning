    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a complex function \\( z = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( z \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is given as:\n   \\[\n   \\tilde{z}(s, y) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(x, y)\\} + i\\mathcal{L}\\{v(x, y)\\}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{u(x, y)\\}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{v(x, y)\\}\\) represent the Laplace transforms of \\( u(x, y) \\) and \\( v(x, y) \\) with respect to \\( x \\), respectively.\n\n3. **Transformation Application**: A new transformation \\( D(u, v) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + i\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\) is applied to \\( z \\).

Additionally, since the original Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{u(x, y)\\}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{v(x, y)\\}\\) depend on \\( y \\), the final result \\(\\tilde{z}(s, y)\\) also depends on \\( y \\).\n\nTherefore, the dependency on \\( y \\) in \\(\\tilde{z}(s, y)\\) is indeed based on the original functions \\( u \\) and \\( v \\), as well as their initial conditions.
