    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the System Dynamics**:\n   - The original system is described by \\(\\dot{x} = Ax\\).\n   - This means that the state \\(x(t)\\) of the system at any time \\(t\\) can be written as \\(x(t) = e^{At}x_0\\), where \\(x_0\\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Transformation Operator \\(L\\)**:\n   - The transformation \\(L\\) is defined as \\(L[\\phi(x)] = \\int_0^t e^{Bs} \\phi(x(s)) ds\\).\n   - Applying \\(L\\) to the initial condition \\(x_0\\) at \\(t=0\\) gives \\(L[x_0] = \\int_0^t e^{Bs} x_0 ds\\).\n\n3. **Behavior of the Transformed System**:\n   - If we apply the transformation \\(L\\) at \\(t=0\\) and then evolve the system under the dynamics \\(\\dot{x} = Ax\\), we need to consider how \\(L[x_0]\\) behaves over time.\n   - The transformed system starts from \\(L[x_0]\\) at \\(t=0\\) and evolves according to \\(\\dot{x} = Ax\\).
