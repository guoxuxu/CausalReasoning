The term \\( \\frac{2}{s} \\) specifically indicates an addition of a step function starting at \\( t = 0 \\), which is different from a simple constant addition throughout the entire time domain.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot unequivocally infer that the original function \\( f(t) \\) had a constant 2 added to it.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the given Laplace transform relationship:\n   \\[ G(s) = F(s) + \\frac{2}{s} \\]\n\n2.
