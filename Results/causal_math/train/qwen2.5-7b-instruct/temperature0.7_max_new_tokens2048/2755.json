    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**:\n   - The system has an input \\( u(t) \\) and an output \\( y(t) \\).\n   - The transfer function of the system is given as \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1} \\).\n   - An external signal modification by \\( f(u) = u e^{st} \\) is applied.\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(u) = u + e^{st}u \\) is introduced as an intervention.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Interventions**:\n   - The function \\( f(u) = u e^{st} \\) modifies the input signal.\n   - The function \\( g(u) = u + e^{st}u \\) modifies the input further by adding the modified signal from \\( f(u) \\).\n\n3. **Impact on Output**:\n   - The output \\( y(t) \\) is determined by the input \\( u(t) \\) through the transfer function \\( H(s) \\).\n   - The transfer function \\( H(s) \\) maps the input \\( u(t) \\) to the output \\( y(t) \\) in the Laplace domain.\n   - Since \\( H(s) \\) is linear and time-invariant, it will process any input signal in the same way regardless of its form.\n\n4. **Considering the Interventions**:\n   - Both \\( f(u) \\) and \\( g(u) \\) modify the input signal \\( u(t) \\).\n   - However, once these modifications are applied, they become part of the input signal that is processed by the transfer function \\( H(s) \\).\n   - The final output \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on the overall input signal after all modifications, which is still processed through the same transfer function \\( H(s) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final output \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will depend on the original transfer function \\( H(s) \\) and the overall modified input signal, but not specifically on how \\( f(u) \\) or \\( g(u) \\) were defined, as long as both functions are linear and additive.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the final output \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend only on the original transfer function \\( H(s) \\) and not on the specific definitions of \\( f(u) \\) or \\( g(u) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether the final output \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the original transfer function \\( H(s) \\) and not on how \\( f(u) \\) or \\( g(u) \\) were defined, let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. **Original System with Transfer Function \\( H(s) \\)**:\n   - The system is described by the transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1} \\).\n   - The input is \\( u(t) \\) and the output is \\( y(t) \\).\n\n2. **Intervention with \\( f(u) \\)**:\n   - An external signal modification is given by \\( f(u) = u e^{st} \\).\n   - This modifies the input to the system at time \\( t \\), but it does not change the overall structure of the system or its transfer function.\n\n3. **Intervention with \\( g(u) \\)**:\n   - At a specific moment \\( t_1 \\), the function \\( g(u) = u + e^{st}u \\) is applied.\n   - This can be simplified to \\( g(u) = (1 + e^{st})u \\).\n\n4. **Impact on Output \\( y(t) \\)**:\n   - The transfer function \\( H(s) \\) describes the relationship between the input and output in the frequency domain.\n   - The application of \\( g(u) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) changes the input to the system at that moment, but the overall behavior of the system after \\( t_1 \\) should still be governed by the same transfer function \\( H(s) \\), assuming no other external modifications or changes to the system structure.\n\n5. **Final Output \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\)**:\n   - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the system's behavior should revert to its original form, as there are no further interventions mentioned.\n   - The output \\( y(T) \\) will depend on the input \\( u(t) \\) and the transfer function \\( H(s) \\), but not directly on how \\( f(u) \\) or \\( g(u) \\) were defined, as long as those functions do not alter the system structure beyond the initial intervention.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the final output \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend only on the original transfer function \\( H(s) \\) and not on how \\( f(u) \\) or \\( g(u) \\) were defined.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**:\n   - We have a feedback loop circuit with a transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1} \\).\n   - The input is \\( u(t) \\) and the output is \\( y(t) \\).\n\n2. **External Signal Modification**:\n   - An external signal is modified by a function \\( f(u) = u e^{st} \\).\n   - At a specific moment \\( t_1 \\), a new function \\( g(u) = u + e^{st}u \\) is applied as an intervention.\n\n3. **Impact Analysis**:\n   - The function \\( g(u) \\) modifies the input in such a way that it adds an exponential component to the input.\n   - This means that the input to the system changes from \\( u(t) \\) to \\( g(u) = u + e^{st}u \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Transfer Function and Output Relationship**:\n   - The output \\( y(t) \\) is determined by the input \\( u(t) \\) through the transfer function \\( H(s) \\).\n   - The relationship can be expressed as \\( Y(s) = H(s) U(s) \\), where \\( Y(s) \\) and \\( U(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( y(t) \\) and \\( u(t) \\), respectively.\n\n5. **Considering the Intervention**:\n   - Before \\( t_1 \\), the input is \\( u(t) \\).\n   - At \\( t_1 \\), the input becomes \\( g(u) = u + e^{st}u \\).\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the input is still influenced by the exponential term \\( e^{st}u \\).\n\n6. **Final Output Dependence**:\n   - The final output \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on the entire history of the input since the system is a continuous-time system.\n   - Since \\( g(u) \\) introduces a new term \\( e^{st}u \\) which is not present in the original input \\( u(t) \\), the output \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend on how \\( g(u) \\) was defined.\n\nTherefore, the final output \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on the definition of \\( g(u) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
