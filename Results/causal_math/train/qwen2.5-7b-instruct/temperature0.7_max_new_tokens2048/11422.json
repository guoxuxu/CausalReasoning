    "To determine if the original frequency \\(\\omega\\) can be deduced from the poles of the Laplace Transform \\(Z(s)\\), let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Express the given function in terms of \\(s\\):**\n   The function is \\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\). The Laplace Transform of \\(z(t)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{i \\omega t} \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s - i \\omega)t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the integral:**\n   This integral converges for \\(\\text{Re}(s - i \\omega) > 0\\), which simplifies to \\(\\text{Re}(s) > \\text{Re}(i \\omega) = 0\\). Therefore, the integral converges for \\(\\text{Re}(s) > 0\\):\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-(s - i \\omega)t}}{-(s - i \\omega)} \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{s - i \\omega}\n   \\]\n   So, the Laplace Transform is:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i \\omega}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identify the poles of \\(Z(s)\\):**\n   The poles of \\(Z(s)\\) are the values of \\(s\\) that make the denominator zero:\n   \\[\n   s - i \\omega = 0 \\implies s = i \\omega\n   \\]\n   Thus, the pole of \\(Z(s)\\) is at \\(s = i \\omega\\).\n\n4. **Determine if \\(\\omega\\) can be deduced from the poles:**\n   From the pole \\(s = i \\omega\\), we can directly extract \\(\\omega\\) as the imaginary part of the pole. If the pole of \\(Z(s)\\) is known, then the value of \\(\\omega\\) can be determined.\n\nTherefore, yes, the original frequency \\(\\omega\\) can be deduced from the poles of the Laplace Transform \\(Z(s)\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
