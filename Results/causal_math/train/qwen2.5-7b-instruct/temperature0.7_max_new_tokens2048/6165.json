    "To analyze how the introduction of a phase shift \\(\\phi\\) affects the Laplace transform of \\(z(t)\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\(z(t) = e^{it}\\). This represents a unit circle in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Phase Shifted Function**: When a phase shift \\(\\phi\\) is introduced, the function becomes \\(f(z) = e^{i(t + \\phi)}\\). This can be rewritten as \\(f(z) = e^{it} \\cdot e^{i\\phi}\\).\n\n3. **Effect of Phase Shift on Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a function \\(g(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} g(t) e^{-st} dt.\n   \\]\n   For \\(z(t) = e^{it}\\), the Laplace transform is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(z)(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{it} e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i(t - s)t} dt.\n   \\]\n   For the phase-shifted function \\(f(z) = e^{i(t + \\phi)}\\), the Laplace transform is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i(t + \\phi)} e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i(t - s)t} e^{i\\phi} dt = e^{i\\phi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i(t - s)t} dt.\n   \\]\n   Notice that the Laplace transform of the phase-shifted function is simply the Laplace transform of the original function multiplied by \\(e^{i\\phi}\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the Laplace transform of the phase-shifted function is the same as the Laplace transform of the original function but scaled by \\(e^{i\\phi}\\), the Laplace transform itself changes due to the phase shift. Specifically, the Laplace transform at any point \\(s\\) will be modified by the factor \\(e^{i\\phi}\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"} because the Laplace transform at a point \\(s\\) will indeed change when a phase shift \\(\\phi\\) is introduced into the function \\(z(t)\\)."
