To find this fixed point \\( z^* \\):\n   \\[\n   z^* = \\frac{1}{1 - cz^*}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( z^* \\):\n   \\[\n   z^*(1 - cz^*) = 1 \\implies z^* - cz^{*2} = 1 \\implies cz^{*2} - z^* + 1 = 0\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula:\n   \\[\n   z^* = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4c}}{2c}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( |c| < 1 \\), the term \\( \\sqrt{1 - 4c} \\) ensures that \\( z^* \\) is well-defined and finite.\n\n4. **Laplace Transform Influence**:\n   The Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\) converts the time-domain function \\( z(t) \\) to the frequency domain. If \\( |c| < 1 \\), the system's stability in the time domain translates to stability in the frequency domain. The transform does not change the fundamental behavior of the system but rather provides a different perspective on its dynamics.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the condition \\( |c| < 1 \\), the system described by \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - cz} \\) will indeed reach a stable state as \\( t \\to \\infty \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Analysis**:\n   The function \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{1 - cz} \\) is a rational function where \\( c \\) is a complex constant. When applied iteratively with an initial input \\( z_0 \\), it forms a feedback loop.\n\n2. **Feedback Loop**:\n   The system can be described as:\n   \\[\n   z_{n+1} = f(z_n) = \\frac{1}{1 - cz_n}\n   \\]\n   We need to determine if the sequence \\( z_n \\) converges as \\( n \\to \\infty \\).\n\n3. **Stability Condition**:\n   For the system to reach a stable state, the magnitude of \\( c \\) must be less than 1 (i.e., \\( |c| < 1 \\)). This ensures that each iteration brings the value closer to the fixed point of the function.\n\n4. **Fixed Point Calculation**:\n   To find the fixed point, set \\( z_{n+1} = z_n = z \\):\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{1}{1 - cz}\n   \\]\n   Multiplying both sides by \\( 1 - cz \\):\n   \\[\n   z(1 - cz) = 1 \\implies z - cz^2 = 1 \\implies cz^2 - z + 1 = 0\n   \\]\n   Solving this quadratic equation for \\( z \\):\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4c}}{2c}\n   \\]\n   Since we assume \\( |c| < 1 \\), the fixed point is real and positive, and the system will converge to this fixed point if \\( |c| < 1 \\).\n\n5. **Laplace Transform Influence**:\n   The Laplace Transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\) transforms the time-domain function \\( z(t) \\) into the frequency domain. However, the stability of the system in the time domain (as determined by the fixed point analysis) does not directly depend on the Laplace Transform but rather on the behavior of the function \\( f(z) \\) itself.\n\nGiven the above analysis, if the initial input \\( z_0 \\) and the condition \\( |c| < 1 \\) are satisfied, the system will indeed reach a stable state as \\( t \\to \\infty \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
