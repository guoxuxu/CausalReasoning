However, the Fourier transform itself does not change over time; it remains the same Dirac delta function regardless of the time \\( T \\).\n\n4. **Phase Information**: The Fourier transform does not carry any phase information about the original signal. It only tells us the presence of different frequencies in the signal. The phase of \\( z(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\) is \\( \\omega t \\), but this phase information is lost in the Fourier transform process.\n\n5. **Determining Initial Phase**: To determine the initial phase of \\( z(0) \\), we need to know the exact value of \\( z(0) \\). However, from the Fourier transform alone, we can only deduce that there is a component at frequency \\( \\omega \\), but we cannot determine the exact phase (which is zero for \\( z(0) = 1 \\)).\n\nTherefore, based on the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) at any time \\( T \\), we cannot determine the original starting phase of \\( z(0) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
