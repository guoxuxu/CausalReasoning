    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Integral Transformation:**\n   - The transformation \\( G(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\) is the definition of the Laplace transform of the function \\( f(t) \\).\n   - Here, \\( s \\) is a complex variable, and \\( f(t) \\) is a real-valued function.\n\n2. **Intervention and Its Impact:**\n   - The problem mentions an \"intervention\" where the function's formulation was switched midway.\n   - This implies that there might be a point \\( t_0 \\) such that for \\( 0 \\leq t < t_0 \\), \\( f(t) = g(t) \\) (where \\( g(t) \\) is some other function), and for \\( t \\geq t_0 \\), \\( f(t) = h(t) \\).\n\n3. **Effect on the Laplace Transform:**\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) would then be split into two parts:\n     \\[\n     G(s) = \\int_0^{t_0} e^{-st} g(t) dt + \\int_{t_0}^\\infty e^{-st} h(t) dt\n     \\]\n   - If \\( g(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) are different functions, their Laplace transforms will generally be different unless they are identical.\n\n4. **Determining Continuity of the Original Function:**\n   - From the Laplace transform \\( G(s) \\), it is not straightforward to determine if \\( f(t) \\) was continuously the same or changed without additional information about the functions \\( g(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform alone does not provide direct information about the continuity of \\( f(t) \\) at the switching point \\( t_0 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without knowing the specific forms of \\( g(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\), and their relationship at \\( t_0 \\), it is impossible to definitively state whether \\( f(t) \\) was continuously the same or changed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
