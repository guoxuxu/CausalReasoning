This shows that the Laplace transform of the shifted function \\( g(t) \\) is not simply a translation of \\( F(s) \\) along the complex plane. Instead, it involves adding a term \\( \\frac{c}{s} \\) which modifies the entire function \\( F(s) \\) in a specific way.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The resulting \\( G(s) \\) is not just a simple translation but includes an additional term that depends on \\( s \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Applying the Linear Shift**: If we have a function \\( g(t) = f(t) + c \\), we need to find the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\).\n\n3. **Transforming \\( g(t) \\)**: The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} (f(t) + c) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This can be split into two integrals:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} ce^{-st} \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluating the Integrals**:\n   - The first integral is simply \\( F(s) \\).\n   - The second integral is a constant \\( c \\) multiplied by the integral of \\( e^{-st} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int_{0}^{\\infty} ce^{-st} \\, dt = c \\left[ \\frac{-e^{-st}}{s} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = c \\left( 0 - \\left( \\frac{-1}{s} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{c}{s}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combining the Results**: Therefore, the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = F(s) + \\frac{c}{s}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Interpreting the Result**: The term \\( \\frac{c}{s} \\) represents a frequency-domain shift, which does not correspond to a simple translation of \\( F(s) \\) along the complex plane. Instead, it modifies the magnitude and phase of \\( F(s) \\) at different frequencies.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the resulting \\( G(s) \\) is not just a simple translation of \\( F(s) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
