    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a function \\( f(t) \\) and apply the Laplace transform to it, obtaining \\( F(s) \\).\n\n2. **Application of Operator D**: The operator \\( D \\) is defined as \\( Dg(t) = g'(t) + ag(t) \\). If we apply this operator to \\( g(t) \\), we get:\n   \\[ Dg(t) = g'(t) + ag(t) \\]\n   Taking the Laplace transform of both sides, using the properties of the Laplace transform, we have:\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}\\{Dg(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{g'(t) + ag(t)\\} \\]\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}\\{Dg(t)\\} = sG(s) - g(0) + aG(s) \\]\n   where \\( G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} \\).\n\n3. **Application of Operator E**: The operator \\( E \\) is defined as \\( Eg(t) = g''(t) + bg(t) \\).

To analyze this, let's consider what happens when we apply these operators in sequence and then take the inverse Laplace transform.\n\n5. **Inverse Laplace Transformation**: After applying the operators \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) to \\( g(t) \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform to obtain \\( h(t) \\). However, the key point here is that the operators \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) are applied to \\( g(t) \\), which itself is the inverse Laplace transform of \\( F(s) \\).
