    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The system starts with an initial state \\(z(0)\\).\n\n2. **Transformation due to \\(M\\)**: The system evolves according to the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = Mz\\).

However, we need to check if the final state depends solely on \\(M\\) and not on \\(N\\) and \\(L\\).\n\n6. **Dependency Check**: To determine if \\(z(T)\\) depends solely on \\(M\\), we need to see if the transformations due to \\(N\\) and \\(L\\) cancel out in the expression for \\(z(T)\\). From the above steps, we have:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{L(T - t_1)}e^{Nt_1}e^{Mt_1}z(0)\n   \\]\n   Since \\(e^{L(T - t_1)}e^{Nt_1}e^{Mt_1}\\) is a product of exponentials, it is generally not equal to \\(e^{MtT}\\) unless \\(N\\) and \\(L\\) are such that their combined effect cancels out.
