Damping influences the transient behavior and the rate of decay of oscillations.\n   - **Initial Transformation**: The transformation \\( h(u) = \\sin(\\omega t) u \\) does not change the physical behavior described by the PDE; it only alters the representation of \\( u \\). Thus, it does not directly affect the dependence of \\( u \\) on \\( c \\) or \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The displacement \\( u(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will depend on both the stiffness \\( k \\) and the damping \\( c \\) because these parameters are explicitly included in the governing equation. The initial transformation \\( h(u) = \\sin(\\omega t) u \\) does not alter this dependency.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
