However, the magnitude of this term depends on the frequency \\( \\omega \\). For a specific frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\), the magnitude will change unless \\( \\omega_0 = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Generally, adding a constant to the real part of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) will affect the Fourier transform's magnitude at non-zero frequencies.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum's magnitude at a specific frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\) will not remain unchanged.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Definition**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (x(t) + iy(t)) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Change in Initial Condition**: At \\( t = 0 \\), we add a constant real number \\( c \\) to \\( x(t) \\). So, the new function becomes \\( x(t) + c \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), but since it's a constant addition, it will affect \\( x(t) \\) for all \\( t \\).\n\n4. **Effect on Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of a shifted signal \\( x(t) + c \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t) + c\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{x(t)\\} + \\mathcal{F}\\{c\\}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{c\\} \\) is a delta function at \\( \\omega = 0 \\) scaled by \\( 2\\pi c \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{c\\} = 2\\pi c \\delta(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the Fourier transform becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\hat{x}(\\omega) + 2\\pi c \\delta(\\omega) + i \\hat{y}(\\omega)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Magnitude Analysis**: The magnitude of the Fourier transform at any frequency \\( \\omega \\neq 0 \\) is unaffected by the constant addition because the delta function only contributes at \\( \\omega = 0 \\). Thus, the magnitude at \\( \\omega_0 \\neq 0 \\) remains the same as before the addition of the constant.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the change in \\( x(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) (a constant shift) does not affect the frequency components other than possibly at \\( \\omega = 0 \\), the magnitude of the spectrum at a specific frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\) will remain unchanged.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

However, since we are considering a specific frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\neq 0 \\), this does not affect the magnitude at \\( \\omega_0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the spectrum's magnitude at a specific frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\) will remain unchanged.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
