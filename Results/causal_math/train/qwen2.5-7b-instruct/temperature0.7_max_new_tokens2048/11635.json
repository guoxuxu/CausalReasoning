Since \\(\\alpha > 0\\), as \\(t \\to \\infty\\), \\(e^{-\\alpha t} \\to 0\\). Therefore, the end behavior of the modified function is dominated by the exponential decay factor \\(e^{-\\alpha t}\\).\n\n4. **Dependency on Parameters**:\n   - The end behavior of \\(z(t)\\) after applying the damping factor depends on both \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\alpha\\). Specifically, the frequency component \\(\\omega\\) influences the oscillatory part, while the damping factor \\(\\alpha\\) influences the exponential decay rate.\n   - However, the question asks if the end behavior depends solely on \\(\\omega\\) and not on \\(\\alpha\\). From our analysis, it is clear that the exponential decay rate due to \\(\\alpha\\) plays a crucial role in determining the end behavior.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the end behavior of \\(z(t)\\) at \\(T > t_1\\) does indeed depend on \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function Analysis**:\n   - The initial function is \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\).\n   - This is a complex exponential function which represents a sinusoidal oscillation with angular frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\n2. **Application of Damping**:\n   - A damping factor \\(g(t) = e^{-\\alpha t}\\) is applied at \\(t_1\\).\n   - The modified function becomes \\(z'(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha (t - t_1)}\\) for \\(t \\geq t_1\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying the Modified Function**:\n   - For \\(t \\geq t_1\\), the function can be rewritten as:\n     \\[\n     z'(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha (t - t_1)} = e^{i\\omega t} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha t + \\alpha t_1} = e^{i\\omega t - \\alpha t + \\alpha t_1}\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     z'(t) = e^{i\\omega t - \\alpha t + \\alpha t_1} = e^{\\alpha t_1} \\cdot e^{i\\omega t - \\alpha t}\n     \\]\n\n4. **End Behavior Analysis**:\n   - As \\(t \\to \\infty\\), the term \\(e^{\\alpha t_1}\\) is a constant.\n   - The term \\(e^{i\\omega t - \\alpha t}\\) describes the behavior of the function.\n   - The term \\(e^{-\\alpha t}\\) decays exponentially to zero because \\(\\alpha > 0\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The exponential decay term \\(e^{-\\alpha t}\\) dominates the behavior of the function as \\(t \\to \\infty\\).\n   - Therefore, the end behavior of \\(z(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) is determined by both \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\alpha\\), but the exponential decay due to \\(\\alpha\\) will eventually make the oscillations insignificant.\n\nGiven this analysis, the end behavior of \\(z(t)\\) at \\(T > t_1\\) does depend on both \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\alpha\\). However, the exponential decay term \\(e^{-\\alpha t}\\) will dominate the behavior for large \\(t\\), making the oscillations caused by \\(\\omega\\) less significant over time.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
