    "To analyze whether the state of the system \\( u(x,T) \\) at time \\( T > t_1 \\) depends solely on the original wave speed \\( c \\) after an intervention changing \\( c \\) to \\( c' \\) at time \\( t_1 \\), let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Equation and Solution**:\n   The given PDE is \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + c \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\). This is a first-order linear PDE known as the advection equation. Its general solution can be written as \\( u(x,t) = f(x - ct) \\), where \\( f \\) is an arbitrary function.\n\n2. **Effect of Fourier Transform**:\n   Applying the Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x,t) \\):\n   \\[\n   F(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( u(x,t) = f(x - ct) \\) into the Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   F(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x - ct) e^{-ikx} dx\n   \\]\n   Using the shift property of the Fourier transform, we get:\n   \\[\n   F(u) = e^{-ickt} F(f)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention Analysis**:\n   At time \\( t_1 \\), the wave speed changes from \\( c \\) to \\( c' \\). This means that for \\( t < t_1 \\), the solution is \\( u(x,t) = f(x - ct) \\), and for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the solution becomes \\( u(x,t) = g(x - c't) \\), where \\( g \\) is another arbitrary function determined by the initial condition at \\( t_1 \\).\n\n4. **State at Time T**:\n   To determine if \\( u(x,T) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) depends solely on \\( c \\), we need to consider the state of the system after the intervention. Since the wave speed changes at \\( t_1 \\), the solution will involve both \\( c \\) and \\( c' \\) depending on the interval of time.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The state of the system \\( u(x,T) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) will include contributions from both the original wave speed \\( c \\) (for \\( t < t_1 \\)) and the new wave speed \\( c' \\) (for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\)). Therefore, it cannot depend solely on the original wave speed \\( c \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
