    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Contour**: We start with the function \\( g(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) integrated over the unit circle \\( C \\).

Since \\( h \\) maps the unit circle to itself (as \\( |z| = 1 \\) implies \\( |z^2| = 1 \\)), the contour remains the unit circle.\n\n3. **Effect of Transformation**: The integral of \\( g(h(z)) \\cdot h'(z) \\) over the new contour \\( h(C) \\) would give us the transformed integral. Here, \\( g(h(z)) = \\frac{1}{z^2} \\) and \\( h'(z) = 2z \\).

Different transformations could yield different results depending on how they map the unit circle and the form of the function \\( g \\).\n\n5. **Determining Transformations**: Knowing only the final value of the integral does not provide enough information to conclusively determine which transformations were applied.

If we apply \\( h \\) to \\( C \\), it maps the unit circle \\( |z| = 1 \\) to another curve in the complex plane. Specifically, for any point \\( z \\) on the unit circle, \\( h(z) = z^2 \\) will map it to a point on the unit circle again because \\( |z^2| = |z|^2 = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Transformation \\( i(z) \\)**: Since no specific transformation \\( i(z) \\) is mentioned other than \\( h(z) \\), we assume \\( i(z) \\) could be the identity transformation (i.e., \\( i(z) = z \\)) or some other transformation, but without loss of generality for this analysis, we focus on \\( h(z) \\).\n\n4. **Integral Transformation**: The integral of \\( g(z) \\) over \\( C \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\oint_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz\n   \\]\n   By Cauchy's integral formula, this integral equals \\( 2\\pi i \\) since \\( g(z) \\) has a simple pole at \\( z = 0 \\) inside the unit circle.\n\n5. **Effect of \\( h(z) \\) on the Integral**: Applying \\( h(z) = z^2 \\) to the contour \\( C \\) does not change the value of the integral because the transformation is a conformal mapping that preserves the winding number around the singularity at \\( z = 0 \\). Therefore, the integral remains \\( 2\\pi i \\).\n\n6. **Determining Transformations from Final Value**: Knowing only the final value of the integral (which is \\( 2\\pi i \\)), we cannot conclusively determine which specific transformations were applied. While \\( h(z) = z^2 \\) was one transformation, there could have been others (like \\( i(z) \\)) that also resulted in the same integral value without changing the winding number around the singularity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

Thus, the contour remains the unit circle.\n\n3. **Effect on the Integral**: When we transform \\( g(z) \\) using \\( h(z) \\), we get a new function \\( g(h^{-1}(w)) \\cdot h'(h^{-1}(w)) \\) where \\( w = h(z) \\).
