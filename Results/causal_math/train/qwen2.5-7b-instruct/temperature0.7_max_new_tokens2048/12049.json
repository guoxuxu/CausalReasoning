Therefore,\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform of \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{1}{s-i}\\right) = e^{it}\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Laplace transform uniquely maps \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) to \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\).\n\n5. **Causal Relationship**: In the context of causality, the Laplace transform assumes that the function \\( z(t) \\) is causal, meaning \\( z(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t < 0 \\). Given this assumption, the Laplace transform provides a one-to-one mapping from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\n6. **Uniqueness**: The uniqueness theorem for the Laplace transform states that if two functions have the same Laplace transform, then they must be identical almost everywhere. Therefore, if we know the Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) and assume causality, we can uniquely determine \\( z(t) \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can unambiguously recover \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) from its Laplace transform \\( L(z(t)) \\), let's analyze the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) is a complex exponential function. It's periodic with a period of \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Definition**: The Laplace transform \\( L(z(t)) \\) of a function \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   L(z(t)) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\):\n   \\[\n   L(e^{it}) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{it} \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(i-s)t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluating the Integral**: To evaluate the integral, we need to consider the convergence conditions for the Laplace transform. The integral converges if the real part of \\( s \\) (denoted as Re\\(s\\)) is greater than 1 (since the exponent \\( i - s \\) will then have a negative real part, ensuring the integral converges):\n   \\[\n   \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(i-s)t} \\, dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(i-s)t}}{i-s} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n   \\]\n   This evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{s-i}\n   \\]\n   So, \\( L(e^{it}) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\).\n\n4. **Recovering \\( z(t) \\) from \\( L(z(t)) \\)**: The Laplace transform \\( L(e^{it}) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\) is a well-known result and corresponds uniquely to \\( e^{it} \\) under the condition that \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\). However, the Laplace transform does not provide information about the causality directly; it only gives the frequency-domain representation.\n\n5. **Causality Consideration**: Causality in the context of the Laplace transform means that the system's response at any time \\( t \\) depends only on past and present inputs, not future ones. For \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which is a purely oscillatory function, the causality is inherently satisfied as long as the function is zero for \\( t < 0 \\).\n\n6. **Uniqueness of Inverse Laplace Transform**: Given the inverse Laplace transform exists and is unique for functions that satisfy certain conditions (like being of exponential order and having no poles on the imaginary axis), the function \\( \\frac{1}{s-i} \\) can be uniquely mapped back to \\( e^{it} \\).\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that with the Laplace transform \\( L(z(t)) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\), we can unambiguously recover \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) without any additional information, provided the conditions for the Laplace transform are met.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
