There is no additional evolution of the spectrum due to the initial transform alone.\n\nGiven these steps, the frequency spectrum is not centered solely at \\( \\omega \\) after applying the Fourier Transform to \\( z(t) \\) and then multiplying by \\( h(t) \\). It is centered at \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Fourier Transform:**\n   - We start with \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\Omega)\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function and \\( \\Omega \\) is the frequency variable in the Fourier domain. In our case, \\( \\Omega = \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Perturbation by Multiplication:**\n   - We introduce a perturbation \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\), which is a decaying exponential.\n   - We then consider the product \\( z(t)h(t) = e^{i \\omega t} e^{-\\alpha t} = e^{-(\\alpha - i\\omega)t} \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of the Perturbed Function:**\n   - Now, we need to find the Fourier Transform of \\( z(t)h(t) = e^{-(\\alpha - i\\omega)t} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{-(\\alpha - i\\omega)t}\\} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha - i\\omega - iu}\n     \\]\n     where \\( u \\) is the frequency variable in the Fourier domain.\n\n4. **Interpretation of the Result:**\n   - The result shows that the Fourier Transform of the perturbed function \\( z(t)h(t) \\) does not center solely at \\( \\omega \\). Instead, it is a complex function that depends on the frequency variable \\( u \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is no, because the frequency spectrum after applying the Fourier Transform to \\( z(t) \\) and then multiplying by \\( h(t) \\) does not remain centered solely at \\( \\omega \\).\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Fourier Transform:**\n   - The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - Applying the Fourier Transform to \\( z(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\}\n     \\]\n     The Fourier Transform of \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) is a Dirac delta function:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\Omega)\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( \\Omega = \\omega \\). So, the frequency spectrum is centered solely at \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Perturbation with Multiplication:**\n   - We introduce a perturbation by multiplying \\( z(t) \\) with \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\):\n     \\[\n     z(t)h(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot e^{-\\alpha t} = e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t}\n     \\]\n   - Now, we apply the Fourier Transform to the perturbed function:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t}\\}\n     \\]\n     This is also a Dirac delta function, but shifted by \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t}\\} = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - (\\Omega + \\alpha))\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( \\Omega = \\omega \\). So, the frequency spectrum is centered at \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\).\n\n3. **Final Analysis:**\n   - If we only consider the Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\) and do not include the perturbation, the frequency spectrum is centered solely at \\( \\omega \\).\n   - However, once the perturbation is applied (multiplying by \\( h(t) \\)), the frequency spectrum shifts to \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, applying the Fourier Transform to \\( z(t) \\) alone yields a frequency spectrum centered solely at \\( \\omega \\). But if we consider the perturbation, the frequency spectrum shifts.\n\nSo, the answer to the question \"Does applying the Fourier Transform to \\( z(t) \\) and then allowing the system to evolve without further action yield a frequency spectrum centered solely at \\( \\omega \\)? \" is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
