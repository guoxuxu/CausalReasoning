    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\) describes how the temperature distribution \\( u(x,t) \\) changes over time due to diffusion.

This source affects the temperature distribution but does not directly reveal its history.\n\n3. **Initial Condition and Boundary Conditions**: To solve the heat equation for a specific situation, initial conditions (temperature at \\( t=0 \\)) and boundary conditions (conditions at the ends of the rod) are required.

However, the problem does not specify these conditions, which are crucial for determining the exact solution.\n\n4. **Temperature Distribution at t=10**: We are given the temperature distribution \\( u(x,10) \\) at t = 10. This gives us information about the state of the system at that specific time but does not directly reveal the history of the heat source.\n\n5. **Influence of Heat Source on Temperature**: The heat source \\( S(x,t) \\) affects the temperature distribution over time. However, the effect of the heat source at different times (e.g., t = 0 vs. t = 10) cannot be directly inferred from the temperature distribution alone without knowledge of \\( h(t) \\).\n\n6. **Uniqueness of Solution**: For a given set of initial and boundary conditions, the heat equation has a unique solution. However, without knowing the form of \\( h(t) \\), we cannot determine if the heat source was present at t = 0 based solely on the temperature distribution at t = 10.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of information about the form of \\( h(t) \\) and the need for both initial and boundary conditions to fully understand the history of the heat source, we cannot deduce whether the heat source was applied at t = 0 from the temperature distribution at t = 10 alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
