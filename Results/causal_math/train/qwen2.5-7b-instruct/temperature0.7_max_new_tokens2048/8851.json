    "To determine if the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is solely dependent on the matrices \\( M \\) and \\( N \\), let's analyze the given system step by step.\n\n1. **Original System Dynamics**: The original system is described by the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\n   \\]\n   where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are constant matrices, and \\( u \\) is the control input.\n\n2. **Control Strategy**: Initially, the control input is given by:\n   \\[\n   u(t) = V(t)x + W(t)\n   \\]\n   where \\( V(t) \\) and \\( W(t) \\) are time-varying matrices.\n\n3. **Change in Control Strategy**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a new control strategy is implemented:\n   \\[\n   u(t) = Q(t)x + R(t)\n   \\]\n   where \\( Q(t) \\) and \\( R(t) \\) are different time-varying matrices.\n\n4. **System Response**: The system dynamics change based on the control strategy. For \\( t < t_1 \\), the system follows the dynamics defined by \\( u(t) = V(t)x + W(t) \\). For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the system follows the dynamics defined by \\( u(t) = Q(t)x + R(t) \\).\n\n5. **Laplace Transform**: Applying the Laplace transform to the differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   sX(s) - x(0) = MX(s) + NU(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( X(s) \\) and \\( U(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( u(t) \\), respectively.\n\n6. **Final State Analysis**: To find the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\), we need to consider both segments of the control input. The solution to the differential equation can be split into two parts:\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\), the state evolves according to \\( u(t) = V(t)x + W(t) \\).\n   - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the state evolves according to \\( u(t) = Q(t)x + R(t) \\).\n\n7. **Dependency on Matrices**: The final state \\( x(T) \\) depends not only on the matrices \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) but also on the specific forms of \\( V(t) \\), \\( W(t) \\), \\( Q(t) \\), and \\( R(t) \\). These time-varying matrices directly influence the state evolution through the control input \\( u(t) \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is not solely dependent on the matrices \\( M \\) and \\( N \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
