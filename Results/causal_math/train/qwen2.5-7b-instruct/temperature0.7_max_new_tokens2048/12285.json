If we observe the state vectors \\( x_n \\) and compare them to the expected values without the transformation, any deviation can be attributed to the term \\( Mu \\).\n\n6. **Inferring the Application of \\( h(x) \\)**: To determine if \\( h(x) \\) was applied, we need to check if there is a consistent deviation from the expected values of \\( M^n x_0 \\) for all \\( n \\). If such a deviation exists, it indicates the presence of \\( u \\), implying that \\( h(x) \\) was indeed applied.\n\nSince we can observe the state vectors \\( x_n \\) and identify any consistent deviation due to \\( u \\), it is possible to infer whether the initial transformation \\( h(x) \\) was applied to \\( x_0 \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The system evolves according to \\( x_{n+1} = Mx_n \\). This means that starting from an initial state \\( x_0 \\), the state at any future time \\( n \\) can be determined by repeated application of the matrix \\( M \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: If the nonlinear transformation \\( h(x) = x + u \\) is applied to the initial state \\( x_0 \\), then the new initial state becomes \\( x_0' = h(x_0) = x_0 + u \\).\n\n3. **Evolution of the Transformed State**: The transformed state \\( x_0' \\) will evolve according to the same rule: \\( x_{n+1}' = Mx_n' \\).\n\n4. **Expressing the Transformed State**: The state at step \\( n \\) after the transformation is:\n   \\[\n   x_n' = M^n (x_0 + u)\n   \\]\n   which expands to:\n   \\[\n   x_n' = M^n x_0 + M^n u\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison with Original Evolution**: Without the transformation, the state at step \\( n \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   x_n = M^n x_0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Inference**: To determine if the transformation \\( h(x) \\) was applied to \\( x_0 \\), we need to compare \\( x_n \\) and \\( x_n' \\):\n   - If \\( x_n = x_n' \\), then no transformation was applied.\n   - If \\( x_n \\neq x_n' \\), then the transformation \\( h(x) \\) was applied, because \\( x_n' \\) includes an additional term \\( M^n u \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given that \\( u \\) is a constant vector, and we know the form of \\( M \\) and how it transforms states over time, we can determine if \\( x_n \\) and \\( x_n' \\) differ. The difference between \\( x_n \\) and \\( x_n' \\) is precisely \\( M^n u \\), which is non-zero unless \\( u \\) is the zero vector. Therefore, we can infer whether the transformation was applied based on the difference between \\( x_n \\) and \\( x_n' \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
