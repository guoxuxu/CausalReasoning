    "To determine if the Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega) \\) will still reveal the original quadratic and linear terms clearly after multiplying \\( z(t) \\) by \\( e^{i kt} \\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Original Function and Fourier Transform**:\n   - The original function is \\( z(t) = t^2 + it \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (t^2 + it) e^{-i \\omega t} dt \\).\n\n2. **Modified Function**:\n   - After multiplying by \\( e^{i kt} \\), the modified function becomes \\( z'(t) = (t^2 + it) e^{i kt} \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of the Modified Function**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z'(t) \\) is \\( F'(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (t^2 + it) e^{i (k - \\omega) t} dt \\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Fourier Transform**:\n   - Notice that the Fourier transform of a product with a complex exponential can be simplified using properties of the Fourier transform.\n   - Specifically, the Fourier transform of \\( e^{i kt} f(t) \\) is \\( F(\\omega - k) \\), where \\( F(\\omega) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\n5. **Applying the Property**:\n   - For \\( z(t) = t^2 + it \\), we need to find the Fourier transforms of \\( t^2 \\) and \\( it \\) separately.\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( t^2 \\) is \\( 2\\pi (-i)^2 \\delta''(\\omega) = -2\\pi \\delta''(\\omega) \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( it \\) is \\( i \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\delta'(\\omega) \\).\n\n6. **Transforms of the Modified Terms**:\n   - For \\( t^2 e^{i kt} \\), the Fourier transform is \\( -2\\pi \\delta''(\\omega - k) \\).\n   - For \\( it e^{i kt} \\), the Fourier transform is \\( i \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\delta'(\\omega - k) \\).\n\n7. **Combining the Transforms**:\n   - Therefore, \\( F'(\\omega) = -2\\pi \\delta''(\\omega - k) + i \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\delta'(\\omega - k) \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Fourier transform \\( F'(\\omega) \\) still contains the original quadratic and linear terms, but shifted by \\( k \\). The quadratic term is represented by the second derivative of the delta function, and the linear term by the first derivative of the delta function.\n\nThus, the Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega) \\) will still reveal the original quadratic and linear terms clearly, albeit shifted by \\( k \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
