However, the exact nature of the intervention (specifically the point \\( t_1 \\) and the new frequency \\( \\omega' \\)) cannot be conclusively detected just from the altered Laplace domain response without additional information.\n\n4. **Observing Alteration in the Laplace Domain**: Observing the alteration in the Laplace domain only provides us with information about the system's behavior in the frequency domain after the intervention.

Knowing the transformed state does not provide direct information about the exact time points unless additional context or data is provided.\n\n6. **Detection of \\( \\omega' \\)**: To detect the new angular frequency \\(\\omega'\\), one would need to compare the transformed states before and after the intervention. If the transformed state changes from \\( Z(s) \\) to \\( Z'(s) \\), it implies a change in the angular frequency from \\(\\omega\\) to \\(\\omega'\\). However, this change alone does not conclusively pinpoint the exact value of \\(\\omega'\\) without further analysis or additional data.\n\nGiven these steps, we cannot conclusively detect the exact point \\( t_1 \\) and the value of \\(\\omega'\\) solely by observing the alteration in the Laplace domain without additional information or analysis.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
