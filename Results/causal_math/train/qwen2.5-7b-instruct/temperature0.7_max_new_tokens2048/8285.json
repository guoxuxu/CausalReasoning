    "To determine if the transformed system's state at time T will be equivalent to directly evolving \\(z(0)\\) under \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = F(z)\\) to time T, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition Transformation**: The initial condition \\(z(0)\\) is transformed using the Laplace Transform \\(\\mathcal{L}\\).
