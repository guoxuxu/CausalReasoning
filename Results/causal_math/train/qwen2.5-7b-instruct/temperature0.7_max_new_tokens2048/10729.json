    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - We have a complex vector \\( z_0 \\).\n   - The vector evolves according to \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Applying Transformation \\( f(z) \\)**:\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), we apply the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\).\n   - This means that at \\( t = 0 \\), the new state of \\( z \\) becomes \\( e^{B \\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0 \\).
