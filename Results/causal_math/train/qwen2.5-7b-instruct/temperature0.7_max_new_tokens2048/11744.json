A higher \\(D\\) means faster diffusion, leading to a more rapid and extensive spread of the pollutant.\n\n3. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - **Scenario 1 (Constant D)**: If \\(D\\) remains constant, the rate of diffusion and hence the spread of the pollutant is consistent over time.\n   - **Scenario 2 (Increased D at t=0)**: If \\(D\\) is increased at \\(t=0\\), the initial rate of diffusion increases. This means that immediately after \\(t=0\\), the pollutant starts spreading more quickly than it would have if \\(D\\) remained unchanged.\n\n4. **Long-Term Effect**: Over time \\(T\\), the effect of increasing \\(D\\) at \\(t=0\\) will be that the pollutant has had a faster initial rate of spread, which translates into a greater overall spread compared to the scenario where \\(D\\) remained constant throughout.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the increase in \\(D\\) leads to an immediate and faster spread, this will result in a greater spread of the pollutant at any point downstream, including at time \\(T\\).\n\nTherefore, the spread of the pollutant at a downstream location at time \\(T\\) will indeed be greater when \\(D\\) is increased at \\(t=0\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
