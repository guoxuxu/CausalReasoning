    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Integral**:\n   - The original function is \\(u(z) = z^k\\).\n   - The integral is \\(I(t) = \\oint_C e^{tz} u(z) dz = \\oint_C e^{tz} z^k dz\\).\n\n2. **Modified Function and Integral**:\n   - The modified function is \\(u'(z) = z^{k+1}\\).\n   - The new integral is \\(I'(t) = \\oint_C e^{tz} u'(z) dz = \\oint_C e^{tz} z^{k+1} dz\\).\n\n3. **Comparison of Integrals**:\n   - We need to compare \\(I(t)\\) and \\(I'(t)\\):\n     - \\(I(t) = \\oint_C e^{tz} z^k dz\\)\n     - \\(I'(t) = \\oint_C e^{tz} z^{k+1} dz\\)\n\n4. **Effect of Increasing \\(k\\) by 1**:\n   - Notice that \\(I'(t)\\) is essentially \\(I(t)\\) multiplied by \\(z\\):\n     - \\(I'(t) = \\oint_C e^{tz} z^{k+1} dz = z \\cdot \\oint_C e^{tz} z^k dz = z \\cdot I(t)\\)\n   - However, since \\(z\\) is a complex variable, it is not simply a constant multiplier over the entire contour \\(C\\).
