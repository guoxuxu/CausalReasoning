    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**: We start with the differential equation \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial t^2} = -\\alpha^2 h\\).

This modifies our function to \\(h(t) = e^{-\\beta (t - t_1)} H(t - t_1)\\), where \\(H(t - t_1)\\) represents the function \\(h(t)\\) shifted in time by \\(t_1\\).\n\n4. **Applying the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\(e^{-\\beta (t - t_1)} H(t - t_1)\\) is needed.
