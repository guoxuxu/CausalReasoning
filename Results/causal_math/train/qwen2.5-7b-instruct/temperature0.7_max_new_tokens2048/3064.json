If such a representation exists, then the answer is yes; otherwise, no.\n\nGiven the information provided, without specific forms of \\( F(s) \\) or further details about \\( f(t) \\), we cannot definitively conclude whether \\( e^{-at} \\) was applied. However, based on the general property discussed:\n\nIf \\( F(s) \\) can be written as \\( F(s + a) \\) for some \\( a \\), then the answer is \"Yes\". Otherwise, it is \"No\".\n\nSince the problem statement does not provide \\( F(s) \\) or confirm its form, we cannot definitively answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" without additional information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"} (indicating insufficient information to confirm the application of exponential damping)."
