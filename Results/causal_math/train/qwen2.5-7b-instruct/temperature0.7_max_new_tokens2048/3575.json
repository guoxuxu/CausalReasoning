The equation remains \\( dz = z \\cdot dt + x \\cdot dW \\).\n   - The intervention \\( k(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) changes the value of \\( x \\) to its square root from that point onward. However, the value of \\( x \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) is already determined by the previous transformations up to \\( t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - Since the equation for \\( z \\) depends directly on \\( x \\) and indirectly through the stochastic term \\( dW \\), the future state of \\( z \\) (for \\( T > t_1 \\)) will be influenced by the current and future values of \\( x \\).\n   - The application of \\( k(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\) at \\( t_1 \\) affects the value of \\( x \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\). However, the effect of \\( h(x) = x^2 \\) on \\( x \\) before \\( t_1 \\) is still relevant because it determines the initial conditions and the path of \\( x \\) leading up to \\( t_1 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The state of \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will depend on the value of \\( x \\) at and after \\( t_1 \\), which includes the effects of both \\( h(x) \\) and \\( k(x) \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
