    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Equation**: The original equation is a linear integro-differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x) \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty g(x, t) y(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( p(x) \\) and \\( g(x, t) \\) are known functions.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Initially, we apply a Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to \\(y(x)\\). This transforms the spatial domain into the frequency domain, changing the form of the equation but not its essence as a differential equation. The transformed equation would involve the Fourier transform of \\(y(x)\\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform Application**: At time \\(t_1\\), a Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}\\) is applied to the system. The Laplace transform is a tool used for solving differential equations by transforming them into algebraic equations. When we apply the Laplace transform to a function, it converts the time-domain function into a frequency-domain function.\n\n4. **Effect of Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform applied at \\(t_1\\) changes the nature of the equation from a time-dependent one to an algebraic equation in the Laplace domain. The state \\(Y(S, t)\\) after the Laplace transform will depend on the transformed initial conditions and the transformed input (if any).\n\n5. **Dependence on Original Equation**: While the original differential equation is no longer directly applicable in the Laplace domain, the solution in the Laplace domain (\\(Y(S, t)\\)) does depend on the original differential equation through the initial conditions and the input function before the Laplace transform was applied. However, once transformed, the solution is expressed in terms of the Laplace variable \\(S\\) and the transformed initial conditions.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The state \\(Y(S, t)\\) at \\(t > t_1\\) does not solely depend on the original differential equation without considering the Laplace transform.

The Fourier transform converts the spatial domain (x) into the frequency domain (ω). However, this does not change the fundamental nature of the differential equation or the integral term; it just changes how we represent the solution.\n\n3. **Laplace Transform Application at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At a specific time \\( t_1 \\), a Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) is applied. The Laplace transform converts a time-domain function into a complex frequency domain. This transformation fundamentally changes the nature of the system from a time-dependent one to a complex frequency-dependent one.\n\n4. **Effect on State \\( Y(S, t) \\)**: When the Laplace transform is applied at \\( t = t_1 \\), the state \\( Y(S, t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) will indeed be influenced by the Laplace transform. The transformed equation will involve the Laplace variable \\( S \\) instead of the time variable \\( t \\).\n\n5. **Independence from Initial Fourier Transform**: The fact that a Fourier transform was initially applied does not affect the outcome after the Laplace transform is applied. The Fourier transform is a spatial transformation, while the Laplace transform is a time-domain transformation. These are independent operations.\n\n6. **Dependence on Original Differential Equation**: The state \\( Y(S, t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) will depend on the original differential equation but will also incorporate the effects of the Laplace transform applied at \\( t = t_1 \\).\n\nGiven these steps, the state \\( Y(S, t) \\) at \\( t > t_1 \\) will indeed depend on the original differential equation as well as the Laplace transform applied at \\( t_1 \\).
