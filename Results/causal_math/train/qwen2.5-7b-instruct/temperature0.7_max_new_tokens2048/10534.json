The values of \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) depend on these coefficients.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **System of Differential Equations**: We have the system:\n   - \\(\\dot{x} = Ax + By\\)\n   - \\(\\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\\)\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}\n   \\]\n   This means:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\) are the Fourier transforms of \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) respectively.\n\n3. **Initial Conditions and Fourier Transform**: To determine \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\), we need to consider the initial conditions and how they relate to the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\) evaluated at \\(s\\) provides information about the frequency domain representation of \\(z(t)\\).\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: The inverse Fourier transform can be used to find \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) from \\(Z(s)\\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{Z(s)\\}\n   \\]\n   However, this does not directly give us the initial values \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\).\n\n5. **Initial Value Theorem**: For linear systems described by differential equations, the initial conditions (i.e., \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\)) can sometimes be determined using the initial value theorem of Laplace transforms. Specifically, if we know \\(Z(s)\\), we can use the initial value theorem:\n   \\[\n   x(0) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} sX(s)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y(0) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} sY(s)\n   \\]\n   However, this requires that \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\) exist and are well-behaved at \\(s \\to \\infty\\).\n\n6. **Dependency on Coefficients \\(A, B, C, D\\)**: The coefficients \\(A, B, C,\\) and \\(D\\) play a crucial role in determining the behavior of the system. Without knowing these coefficients, it is impossible to directly compute \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\) from \\(Z(s)\\) alone.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given only \\(Z(s)\\) and no additional information about the coefficients \\(A, B, C,\\) and \\(D\\), we cannot uniquely determine \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
