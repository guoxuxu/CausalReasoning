However, the limits of integration from 0 to \\( \\infty \\) do not depend on \\( t \\).\n\n3. **Integral Evaluation**: For a fixed \\( z \\) and varying \\( t \\), the integral will change because the exponential term \\( e^{-st} \\) depends on \\( t \\).

Since the integral involves an exponential decay factor \\( e^{-st} \\) which depends on \\( t \\), changing \\( t \\) will change the contribution of each \\( s \\) in the integral.\n\n6. **Non-Linearity and Non-Independence**: The integral does not separate into parts that allow us to directly infer earlier times based solely on the value at \\( T \\).

However, it's important to note that \\( t \\) is not a parameter of the function \\( g(z) \\); rather, it appears in the integrand as part of the exponent.\n\n3. **Integral Representation**: The integral representation suggests that the value of \\( g(z) \\) depends on the integration over all positive real values of \\( s \\). This means that the current value of \\( g(z) \\) at any time \\( T \\) is influenced by contributions from all previous times, as the integral extends from 0 to infinity.\n\n4. **Dependency on Time**: Since the integral involves \\( e^{-st} \\), the value of \\( g(z) \\) at any time \\( T \\) is a weighted sum of the contributions from all previous times.
