Applying the transformation \\( z \\mapsto w = e^{az + b} \\) would change the integrand and the path of integration.\n\n3. **Corrective Transformation**: The question mentions a \"corrective transformation\" during the integral. Typically, such a transformation might be needed to simplify the integral or to revert back to the original variables after some manipulation. However, without specifying what this corrective transformation is, it's hard to proceed directly.\n\n4. **Effect on Integral**: Generally, when transforming integrals in complex analysis, the effect on the integral depends on how the differential \\( dz \\) transforms.

Specifically, we are looking at how the integral \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\) changes when transformed.\n\n3. **Change of Variables**: When transforming the integral, we use the change of variables formula for complex integrals. For a function \\(f(z)\\) and a transformation \\(w = g(z)\\), the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{g^{-1}(C)} f(g(z)) \\cdot g'(z) \\, dz\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(g(z) = e^{az + b}\\).\n\n4. **Derivative of the Transformation**: The derivative of \\(g(z)\\) with respect to \\(z\\) is:\n   \\[\n   g'(z) = \\frac{d}{dz} e^{az + b} = ae^{az + b}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Transformed Integral**: Substituting \\(g(z)\\) and \\(g'(z)\\) into the integral transformation formula, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\rightarrow \\int_{g^{-1}(C)} f(e^{az + b}) \\cdot ae^{az + b} \\, dz\n   \\]\n\n6. **Effect of the Transformation**: The transformed integral depends on both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).
