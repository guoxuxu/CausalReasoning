This means that the system does not have any effect on future inputs based on past outputs.\n\n6. **Determining \\( X(s) \\)**: If we only know \\( Y(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\), and assuming \\( H(s) \\) is known and invertible, we can solve for \\( X(s) \\) using:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{H(s)}\n   \\]\n   Then, we can find \\( x(t) \\) by taking the inverse Laplace transform of \\( X(s) \\).\n\n7. **Determining \\( H(s) \\)**: If \\( Y(s) \\) is known and \\( X(s) \\) is also known, then \\( H(s) \\) can be determined as:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( H(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of a causal function, it must have no poles in the right half-plane.\n\nGiven these points, we can indeed determine \\( X(s) \\) from \\( Y(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\), and \\( H(s) \\) can be determined from \\( Y(s) \\) and \\( X(s) \\) if they are provided. However, the question specifically asks if we can determine both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) precisely just by knowing \\( \\mathcal{L}(y'(t)) \\), which implies we need to consider the derivative of \\( y(t) \\).\n\nSince the Laplace transform of the derivative of \\( y(t) \\) would involve additional information about the initial conditions and higher-order derivatives, and without specific initial conditions, we cannot uniquely determine both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) just from \\( \\mathcal{L}(y'(t)) \\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
