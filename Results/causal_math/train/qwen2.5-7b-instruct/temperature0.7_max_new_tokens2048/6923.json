    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Circuit Model**: \n   - We start with the differential equation \\(L \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\).\n   - This equation describes the behavior of an inductor (L) and a resistor (R) in series under an AC voltage source \\(V(t)\\).\n\n2. **Applying Laplace Transform**:\n   - When applying the Laplace transform to the differential equation, we get \\(L[sI(s) - I(0)] + RI(s) = V(s)\\), where \\(I(s)\\) and \\(V(s)\\) are the Laplace transforms of \\(I(t)\\) and \\(V(t)\\), respectively.\n   - Simplifying, we have \\(LsI(s) - LI(0) + RI(s) = V(s)\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(I(s) = \\frac{V(s) + LI(0)}{Ls + R}\\).\n\n3. **Introducing Time-Dependent Resistance \\(R(t)\\)**:\n   - If we change \\(R\\) to \\(R(t)\\), the differential equation becomes \\(L \\frac{dI}{dt} + R(t)I = V(t)\\).\n   - Applying the Laplace transform again, we get \\(L[sI(s) - I(0)] + R(s)I(s) = V(s)\\), where \\(R(s)\\) is the Laplace transform of \\(R(t)\\).\n\n4. **Transformed Current Expression**:\n   - The transformed current now becomes \\(I(s) = \\frac{V(s) + LI(0)}{Ls + R(s)}\\).\n   - Notice that \\(R(s)\\) now depends on the Laplace transform of the time-varying resistance, which means it is no longer a constant but a function of \\(s\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \\(R(s)\\) is a function of \\(s\\) and represents the Laplace transform of \\(R(t)\\), the transformed current \\(I(s)\\) does indeed depend on the varying resistance through \\(R(s)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
