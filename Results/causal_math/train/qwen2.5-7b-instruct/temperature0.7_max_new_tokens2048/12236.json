    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, consider the original differential equation:\n   \\[ \\frac{dy}{dt} = Ky \\]\n   This is a simple first-order linear differential equation with the solution:\n   \\[ y(t) = y_0 e^{Kt} \\]\n   where \\(y_0\\) is the initial condition at \\(t=0\\).\n\n2.
