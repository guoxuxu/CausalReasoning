The solution to this equation is:\n   \\[\n   x(t) = e^{At}x(0)\n   \\]\n   where \\( x(0) \\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( x(t) \\):**\n   The Fourier transform of \\( x(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} x(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( x(t) = e^{At}x(0) \\) into the Fourier transform definition, we get:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{At} x(0) dt = x(0) \\int_0^\\infty e^{(A-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluating the Integral:**\n   The integral can be evaluated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^\\infty e^{(A-s)t} dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(A-s)t}}{A-s} \\right]_0^\\infty\n   \\]\n   For the integral to converge, the real part of \\( A - s \\) must be negative (i.e., the real part of \\( s \\) must be greater than the real part of \\( A \\)). Assuming this condition is met, the result is:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^\\infty e^{(A-s)t} dt = \\frac{1}{s - A}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the Fourier transform is:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\frac{x(0)}{s - A}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourier Transform at Any Time \\( t \\):**\n   If we apply the Fourier transform at any intermediate time \\( t \\), we need to consider the state of the system at that time, which is \\( x(t) = e^{At}x(0) \\).
