However, for the sake of this problem, let's assume \\( T \\) is a time or parameter value at which we evaluate the transformed function.\n\n5. **Determining if \\( z_0 \\) was the original starting point:**\n   - To determine if \\( z_0 \\) was the original starting point, we need to know the initial condition. If \\( z_0 = e^{i\\lambda t_0} \\), then the original starting point corresponds to \\( t = t_0 \\).\n   - The transformed function \\( T(z(t)) = e^{ik\\lambda t} \\) does not directly give us information about the initial point \\( z_0 \\). It only tells us how the function evolves under the transformation.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional information about the initial condition or the specific value of \\( t \\) corresponding to \\( z_0 \\), we cannot conclusively determine if \\( z_0 \\) was the original starting point based solely on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

Let's assume the question means observing \\( z'(t) \\) at some specific value of \\( t \\).\n\n5. **Original Starting Point**:\n   - The original starting point is when \\( t = 0 \\), which gives \\( z(0) = e^{i\\lambda \\cdot 0} = 1 \\).\n\n6. **Transformed Value**:\n   - After applying the transformation \\( T \\), if we start from \\( z(0) = 1 \\), then \\( T(1) = 1^k = 1 \\).
