    "To answer this question, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**: We start with the differential equation \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z + k\\).\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace Transform of \\(z(t)\\) is defined as \\(Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt\\). For the given differential equation, applying the Laplace Transform yields:\n   \\[\n   sZ(s) - z(0) = i\\omega Z(s) + \\frac{k}{s}\n   \\]\n   Given the initial condition \\(z(0) = z_0\\), we can rearrange this to solve for \\(Z(s)\\):\n   \\[\n   (s - i\\omega)Z(s) = z_0 + \\frac{k}{s}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{z_0}{s - i\\omega} + \\frac{k}{s(s - i\\omega)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To recover \\(z(t)\\), we need to find the inverse Laplace Transform of \\(Z(s)\\).
