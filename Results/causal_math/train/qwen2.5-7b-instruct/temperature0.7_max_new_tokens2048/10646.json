    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformations**:\n   - We have a complex-valued function \\( f(z) \\) which is analytic.\n   - First, we apply the transformation \\( e^z \\) to \\( f(z) \\), resulting in \\( g(z) = e^z f(z) \\).\n   - Then, we apply the Fourier Transform \\( F \\) to \\( g(z) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Properties**:\n   - The Fourier Transform \\( F \\) maps functions from the time (or space) domain to the frequency domain.\n   - For an analytic function \\( h(z) \\), its Fourier Transform \\( F(h(z)) \\) provides information about the frequency components of \\( h(z) \\).\n\n3. **Reversing the Process**:\n   - Given the transformed function \\( F(g(z)) \\), our goal is to uniquely determine \\( f(z) \\).\n   - Since \\( g(z) = e^z f(z) \\), the inverse process would involve:\n     1. Applying the inverse Fourier Transform to \\( F(g(z)) \\) to get back to the time (or space) domain.\n     2. Dividing the result by \\( e^z \\) to isolate \\( f(z) \\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness**:\n   - The key issue here is whether the division by \\( e^z \\) can be done uniquely.\n   - The function \\( e^z \\) is never zero for any complex \\( z \\), so theoretically, dividing by \\( e^z \\) should be possible.\n   - However, the division by \\( e^z \\) introduces a phase shift that is not unique because \\( e^{z + 2\\pi i k} = e^z \\) for any integer \\( k \\). This means that without additional information, we cannot uniquely determine the original \\( f(z) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the Fourier Transform and the exponential transformation provide a lot of information, the phase ambiguity introduced by \\( e^z \\) means that we cannot uniquely determine \\( f(z) \\) solely from \\( F(g(z)) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

There could be multiple functions \\( f(z) \\) that, when multiplied by \\( e^z \\), give rise to the same Fourier transform.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and standard properties of Fourier transforms and analytic functions, we cannot uniquely determine \\( f(z) \\) from the Fourier transform of \\( g(z) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
