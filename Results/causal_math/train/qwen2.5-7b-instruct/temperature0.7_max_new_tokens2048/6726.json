    "To determine if a narrower peak in \\( F(\\omega) \\) can be used to infer that \\( n \\) was increased, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function given is \\( f(z) = z^n \\), where \\( z \\) is a complex number and \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( f(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( f(t) = t^n \\), the Fourier transform will depend on the value of \\( n \\).\n\n3. **Behavior of Fourier Transforms for Powers of \\( t \\)**:\n   - For \\( n = 0 \\): \\( f(t) = 1 \\), and its Fourier transform is a constant.\n   - For \\( n = 1 \\): \\( f(t) = t \\), and its Fourier transform involves an impulse function.\n   - For \\( n > 1 \\): The Fourier transform of \\( t^n \\) decays more rapidly as \\( n \\) increases.

In other words, it indicates that the function \\( f(t) \\) is more localized in the time domain.\n\n4. **Relationship Between Time and Frequency Domains**: According to the uncertainty principle in Fourier analysis, if a function is very narrow in one domain (time domain here), its Fourier transform will be broad in the other domain (frequency domain). Conversely, if the Fourier transform is narrow, the original function must be broad in the time domain.\n\n5. **Effect of Increasing \\( n \\)**: As \\( n \\) increases, \\( f(t) = t^n \\) becomes more oscillatory and spreads out over a wider range of values.
