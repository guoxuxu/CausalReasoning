    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**: We start with the differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = i\\omega z\\).

Applying this transformation to the solution of the differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   g(z(t)) = e^{\\alpha t} z(t) = e^{\\alpha t} z_0 e^{i\\omega t} = z_0 e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)t}\n   \\]\n   Let's denote this transformed function as \\(z'(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = z_0 e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Observation at Time \\(T\\)**: If we observe \\(z(T)\\) at some specific time \\(T\\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z_0 e^{i\\omega T}\n   \\]\n   And for the transformed function:\n   \\[\n   z'(T) = z_0 e^{(\\alpha + i\\omega)T}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Reversing the Transformation**: To find \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(T)\\) or \\(z'(T)\\), we need to reverse the transformation. From \\(z(T)\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   z_0 = z(T) e^{-i\\omega T}\n   \\]\n   Similarly, from \\(z'(T)\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   z_0 = z'(T) e^{-(\\alpha + i\\omega)T}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without the transformation, we can directly find \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(T)\\) because the transformation does not affect the ability to deduce \\(z_0\\) from \\(z(T)\\).
