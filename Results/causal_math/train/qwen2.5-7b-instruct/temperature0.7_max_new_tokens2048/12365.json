    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Original System Dynamics**: The system is described by the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Az \\), where \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) and \\( A \\) is a constant matrix. This implies that \\( z(t) \\) evolves over time according to the linear dynamics defined by \\( A \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: The transformation \\( f(z) = e^{Bt}z \\) is applied at time \\( t \\).
