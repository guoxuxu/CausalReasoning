    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Path Integral**: The original integral is given by:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{original}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(z) \\, dz = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (z^2 + pz + q) \\, dz\n   \\]\n   This integral represents the area under the curve \\( h(z) \\) from \\( z_0 \\) to \\( z_1 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation \\( g(z) = z + c \\) shifts every point on the path by a constant complex number \\( c \\). If we apply this transformation to the endpoints \\( z_0 \\) and \\( z_1 \\), the new endpoints become \\( z_0 + c \\) and \\( z_1 + c \\).\n\n3. **New Path Integral**: The new integral is given by:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}} = \\int_{z_0 + c}^{z_1 + c} h(z) \\, dz\n   \\]\n   To understand if \\( I_{\\text{new}} \\) equals \\( I_{\\text{original}} \\), let's substitute \\( z = w - c \\) into the new integral. When \\( z = z_0 + c \\), \\( w = z_0 \\); when \\( z = z_1 + c \\), \\( w = z_1 \\). Thus, the new integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(w - c) \\, dw\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute \\( h(z) \\)**: Substitute \\( h(z) = z^2 + pz + q \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} ((w - c)^2 + p(w - c) + q) \\, dw\n   \\]\n   Expand and simplify:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (w^2 - 2cw + c^2 + pw - pc + q) \\, dw\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (w^2 + (p - 2c)w + (q - pc + c^2)) \\, dw\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compare with Original Integral**: Notice that the integrand \\( w^2 + (p - 2c)w + (q - pc + c^2) \\) is not identical to \\( w^2 + pw + q \\) unless \\( p = 2c \\) and \\( q = pc - c^2 \\). However, these conditions are not generally satisfied for arbitrary \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the integrands are not identical, the integrals over the same interval do not necessarily yield the same result. Therefore, the integral along the new path does not equal the integral along the original path.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Path and Integral**: The original path is from \\(z_0\\) to \\(z_1\\). The integral of \\(h(z)\\) along this path is given by:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{original}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(z) \\, dz\n   \\]\n\n2. **Transformation by \\(g(z)\\)**: The transformation is defined as \\(g(z) = z + c\\), where \\(c\\) is a constant complex number. This means that every point \\(z\\) on the original path is shifted by \\(c\\). Therefore, the new starting point is \\(z_0 + c\\) and the new ending point is \\(z_1 + c\\).\n\n3. **New Path and Integral**: The new path is from \\(z_0 + c\\) to \\(z_1 + c\\). The integral of \\(h(z)\\) along this new path is given by:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}} = \\int_{z_0 + c}^{z_1 + c} h(z) \\, dz\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitution for New Integral**: To evaluate \\(I_{\\text{new}}\\), we can use the substitution \\(w = z - c\\). Then \\(dw = dz\\) and the limits of integration change from \\(z_0 + c\\) to \\(z_1 + c\\) to \\(z_0\\) to \\(z_1\\). So, we have:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(w + c) \\, dw\n   \\]\n   Since \\(h(z) = z^2 + pz + q\\), we substitute \\(w + c\\) for \\(z\\):\n   \\[\n   h(w + c) = (w + c)^2 + p(w + c) + q = w^2 + 2cw + c^2 + pw + pc + q = w^2 + (2c + p)w + (c^2 + pc + q)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} \\left( w^2 + (2c + p)w + (c^2 + pc + q) \\right) \\, dw\n   \\]\n   This can be split into three separate integrals:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} w^2 \\, dw + \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (2c + p)w \\, dw + \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (c^2 + pc + q) \\, dw\n   \\]\n   Each of these integrals can be evaluated separately. The first integral is:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} w^2 \\, dw = \\left[ \\frac{w^3}{3} \\right]_{z_0}^{z_1} = \\frac{z_1^3}{3} - \\frac{z_0^3}{3}\n   \\]\n   The second integral is:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (2c + p)w \\, dw = (2c + p) \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} w \\, dw = (2c + p) \\left[ \\frac{w^2}{2} \\right]_{z_0}^{z_1} = (2c + p) \\left( \\frac{z_1^2}{2} - \\frac{z_0^2}{2} \\right)\n   \\]\n   The third integral is:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (c^2 + pc + q) \\, dw = (c^2 + pc + q) \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} 1 \\, dw = (c^2 + pc + q) (z_1 - z_0)\n   \\]\n   Combining all these results, we get:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{z_1^3 - z_0^3}{3} + (2c + p) \\left( \\frac{z_1^2 - z_0^2}{2} \\right) + (c^2 + pc + q) (z_1 - z_0)\n   \\]\n   Notice that this expression is not necessarily equal to \\(I_{\\text{original}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(z) \\, dz\\), because the terms involving \\(c\\) do not cancel out in general.\n\nTherefore, the new integral is not equal to the original integral.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Path and Integral**: The original path is from \\(z_0\\) to \\(z_1\\). The integral of \\(h(z)\\) along this path can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{original}} = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} h(z) \\, dz = \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (z^2 + pz + q) \\, dz\n   \\]\n\n2. **Transformation by \\(g(z)\\)**: The transformation is given by \\(g(z) = z + c\\). Applying this transformation to the endpoints of the original path, the new path starts at \\(g(z_0) = z_0 + c\\) and ends at \\(g(z_1) = z_1 + c\\).\n\n3. **Integral Along the Transformed Path**: The integral of \\(h(z)\\) along the transformed path can be written as:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{transformed}} = \\int_{z_0 + c}^{z_1 + c} h(z) \\, dz\n   \\]\n   To evaluate this, we need to consider how the integrand \\(h(z)\\) behaves under the transformation. Since \\(h(z) = z^2 + pz + q\\) is a polynomial, it is a holomorphic (complex differentiable) function. Holomorphic functions have a special property that allows us to shift the path of integration without changing the value of the integral, provided the function is integrable over the paths involved.\n\n4. **Path Independence of Holomorphic Functions**: For a holomorphic function \\(h(z)\\), the integral along any path between two fixed points is independent of the path itself. This means that the integral from \\(z_0 + c\\) to \\(z_1 + c\\) is the same as the integral from \\(z_0\\) to \\(z_1\\).\n\nTherefore, the integral along the transformed path should equal the integral along the original path.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
