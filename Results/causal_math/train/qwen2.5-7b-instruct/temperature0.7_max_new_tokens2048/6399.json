    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Equation Analysis**:\n   The given PDE is \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u\\). This is a first-order linear PDE that describes exponential decay over time.\n\n2. **Transformation \\(T(u)\\)**:\n   The transformation \\(T(u) = u e^{-\\lambda t}\\) modifies the function \\(u(x,t)\\) by multiplying it with \\(e^{-\\lambda t}\\). This transformation effectively absorbs the time dependence into the function itself.\n\n3. **Applying \\(T(u)\\) Repeatedly**:\n   If we apply \\(T(u)\\) repeatedly at each interval \\(\\Delta t\\), we need to understand what this means for the dynamics of \\(u(x,t)\\). Let's denote the state of \\(u\\) at time \\(t_n = n\\Delta t\\) as \\(u_n\\).\n\n4. **Effect of Transformation**:\n   At each step, applying \\(T(u)\\) means we are transforming \\(u_{n-1}\\) to \\(u_n\\) using \\(T(u) = u e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t}\\). So, if we start from \\(u_0\\) at \\(t=0\\), after one interval \\(\\Delta t\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   u_1 = u_0 e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t}\n   \\]\n   For the next interval, applying the same transformation:\n   \\[\n   u_2 = u_1 e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t} = u_0 (e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t})^2\n   \\]\n   Generalizing this for \\(n\\) intervals, we get:\n   \\[\n   u_n = u_0 (e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t})^n = u_0 e^{-\\lambda n \\Delta t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison with Original Dynamics**:\n   The original dynamics described by the PDE \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u\\) would evolve \\(u\\) according to:\n   \\[\n   u(t) = u(0) e^{-\\lambda t}\n   \\]\n   Comparing this with the result of applying \\(T(u)\\) repeatedly, we see that they match exactly:\n   \\[\n   u(t) = u_0 e^{-\\lambda t} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u_n = u_0 e^{-\\lambda n \\Delta t}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Since \\(u_n\\) at each step \\(t_n = n\\Delta t\\) perfectly matches the solution of the original PDE, applying \\(T(u)\\) repeatedly does indeed represent the original dynamics of \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -\\lambda u\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
