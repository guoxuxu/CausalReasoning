  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( T(z) \\\\) affects the evolution of the function over time. Initially, \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\), but after applying the transformation and continuing without intervention, the transformation accumulates the effect of the integral of \\\\( e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\\\), which alters the result from the simply evolving \\\\( e^{i\\omega t} \\\\).",
