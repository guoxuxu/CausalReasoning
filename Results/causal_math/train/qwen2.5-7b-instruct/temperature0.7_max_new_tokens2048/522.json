Feedback systems typically have a delayed effect on the output because they modify the system's behavior based on the current output. If \\( K \\) was introduced at \\( t = 0 \\), the system would start operating with feedback immediately.\n\n5. **Analyzing the Information Given**: However, the problem states that \"assuming no other information about the system is available,\" this means we cannot make assumptions beyond what is directly stated.
