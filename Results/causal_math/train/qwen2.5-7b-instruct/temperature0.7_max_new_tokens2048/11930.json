For real \\( t \\), the Laplace transform of \\( \\cos(at) \\) is \\( \\frac{s}{s^2 + a^2} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that \\( z \\) is complex, the direct application of the Laplace transform to \\( e^z \\) and \\( \\cos(z) \\) is not straightforward and would require a more detailed analysis involving complex analysis techniques.\n   - However, based on the linearity property, if we assume the transforms exist and are well-defined in the context of complex variables, then yes, the Laplace transform of \\( g(z) \\) would indeed be the sum of the Laplace transforms of \\( e^z \\) and \\( \\cos(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"} assuming the transforms are well-defined in the given context.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Define the functions:**\n   - \\( f(z) = e^z \\)\n   - \\( g(z) = f(z) + \\cos(z) = e^z + \\cos(z) \\)\n\n2. **Apply the Laplace Transform:**\n   - The Laplace transform of a function \\( h(t) \\) is defined as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty h(t)e^{-st} dt \\).\n\n3. **Transform \\( f(z) = e^z \\):**\n   - Note that \\( f(z) = e^z \\) is not a function of time \\( t \\), but rather a function of a complex variable \\( z \\). However, for the purpose of applying the Laplace transform, we can consider it as a function of \\( t \\) with \\( z = t \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( e^t \\) (assuming \\( s > 1 \\)) is \\( \\frac{1}{s-1} \\).\n\n4. **Transform \\( \\cos(z) \\):**\n   - Similarly, \\( \\cos(z) \\) is considered as a function of \\( t \\) with \\( z = t \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( \\cos(t) \\) is \\( \\frac{s}{s^2 + 1} \\).\n\n5. **Additivity Property of Laplace Transforms:**\n   - The Laplace transform has the property that if \\( h_1(t) \\) and \\( h_2(t) \\) are two functions, then the Laplace transform of their sum is the sum of their individual Laplace transforms:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{h_1(t) + h_2(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{h_1(t)\\}(s) + \\mathcal{L}\\{h_2(t)\\}(s)\n     \\]\n\n6. **Apply the additivity property:**\n   - Since \\( g(z) = e^z + \\cos(z) \\), the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) should be the sum of the Laplace transforms of \\( e^t \\) and \\( \\cos(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^t\\}(s) + \\mathcal{L}\\{\\cos(t)\\}(s) = \\frac{1}{s-1} + \\frac{s}{s^2 + 1}\n     \\]\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the resulting function's transform is indeed a direct additive result of the Laplace transforms of \\( e^z \\) and \\( \\cos(z) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
