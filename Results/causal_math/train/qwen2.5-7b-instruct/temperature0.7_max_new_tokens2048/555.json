    "To determine if the representation of the system at \\( s = T \\) depends solely on the new \\( b' \\) and not on the initial \\( b \\), let's reason through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The system is described by the differential equations:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{x} = ax - by\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\dot{y} = bx + ay\n   \\]\n   where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are constants.\n\n2. **Intervention at \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), \\( b \\) is modified to \\( b' \\).
