This is because both scenarios could lead to changes in the integral value depending on how the contour interacts with the poles.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about the specific deformations made to the contour and their exact paths relative to the poles, it is impossible to deduce solely from the integral outcome whether the deformation was the cause of a change or if it was the original function's structure (presence of poles) that influenced the result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

For example, deforming the contour to sidestep the poles would be considered an intervention.\n\n4. **Original Cause**: The original cause refers to the initial conditions or the standard path used without any intervention, leading to the integral outcome.\n\n5. **Outcome Analysis**: The integral outcome is influenced by both the function \\( f(z) \\) and the chosen contour path.

This can affect the value of the integral due to the residues at the poles and how they contribute to the integral based on the path chosen.\n\n4. **Impact of Path Deformation**: If the contour deformation does not enclose the poles differently, the integral value might remain the same due to the residue theorem.
