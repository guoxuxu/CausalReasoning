For a general complex exponential \\( e^{(A+iB)t} \\), the Fourier transform will show a peak at \\( \\omega = -B \\) if we consider the standard definition of the Fourier transform for such functions.\n\n3. **Observation at Time T**: The observation of \\( F(\\omega) \\) at time \\( T \\) shows a peak at \\( \\omega = 2B \\).
