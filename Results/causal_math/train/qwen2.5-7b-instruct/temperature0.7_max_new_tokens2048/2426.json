    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is denoted as \\( s(t) = L[f(t)] \\). This transform converts a time-domain function into a frequency-domain representation.\n\n2. **Convolution Impact**: When a convolution operation occurs, it is represented as \\( h(t) = f(t) * g(t) \\). In the frequency domain, the convolution of two functions corresponds to the product of their respective transforms: \\( S'(s) = S(s) \\cdot G(s) \\), where \\( S'(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( h(t) \\).\n\n3. **Reversing the Process**: To deduce the exact form of \\( g(t) \\) from the transformed signal \\( s'(t) \\), one would need to reverse the process. Given \\( S'(s) \\), we know that \\( S'(s) = S(s) \\cdot G(s) \\). To find \\( G(s) \\), we would ideally divide \\( S'(s) \\) by \\( S(s) \\): \\( G(s) = \\frac{S'(s)}{S(s)} \\).\n\n4. **Inversion Back to Time Domain**: Once \\( G(s) \\) is obtained, the inverse Laplace transform can be applied to recover \\( g(t) \\). However, this process is not always straightforward due to the potential for multiple solutions (non-uniqueness) and the presence of singularities or zeros that might complicate the inversion.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While theoretically possible under certain conditions, deducing the exact form of \\( g(t) \\) from \\( s'(t) \\) alone is not guaranteed without additional information about \\( f(t) \\) and \\( S(s) \\). The process involves solving an equation and performing an inverse transform, which may not have a unique solution.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to whether we can deduce the exact form of \\( g(t) \\) is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

The exact form of \\( g(t) \\) depends on the specific forms of \\( f(t) \\) and the resulting \\( s'(t) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Knowing only \\( s'(t) \\) and \\( s(t) \\) does not necessarily allow us to deduce the exact form of \\( g(t) \\) without additional information about \\( f(t) \\) or specific properties of \\( g(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
