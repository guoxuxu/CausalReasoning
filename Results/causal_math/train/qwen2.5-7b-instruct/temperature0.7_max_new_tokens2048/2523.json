    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation**: We start with the function \\( f(z) = e^z \\). This transformation maps a complex number \\( z \\) to another complex number in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Linear Transformation by \\( b \\)**: At some point in time \\( t_1 \\), we apply a linear transformation to the result of the initial transformation. Specifically, we multiply the output of \\( f(z) \\) by a complex constant \\( b \\). The new function becomes \\( g(z) = b \\cdot e^z \\).\n\n3. **Question Analysis**: The question asks if the final output will strictly depend on the original function application without considering \\( b \\). In other words, it's asking if the effect of \\( b \\) can be ignored.\n\n4. **Dependency Check**:\n   - The function \\( g(z) = b \\cdot e^z \\) explicitly includes the factor \\( b \\).\n   - For the final output not to depend on \\( b \\), the value of \\( b \\) must be such that it cancels out or has no influence on the result.\n   - However, since \\( b \\) is a complex constant and not necessarily 1 (the multiplicative identity), its value will generally affect the final output unless \\( b = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since \\( b \\) is a non-trivial complex constant, it will generally affect the final output. Therefore, the final output will depend on the original function application as well as the value of \\( b \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
