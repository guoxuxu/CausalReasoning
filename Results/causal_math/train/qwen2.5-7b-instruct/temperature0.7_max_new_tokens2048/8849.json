    "To reason through this problem:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The system is described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Mx + Nu\\), where \\(u(t) = V(t)x + W(t)\\).\n\n2. **Initial Control Strategy**: At \\(t = 0\\), the control input is \\(u(0) = V(0)x + W(0)\\). This means that initially, the control input is a function of the current state \\(x\\) and some constants \\(V(0)\\) and \\(W(0)\\).\n\n3. **System Evolution**: After applying this initial control strategy, the system evolves according to the differential equation. The evolution of the state \\(x(t)\\) depends on both \\(M\\) and \\(N\\), as well as the control input \\(u(t)\\).\n\n4. **Laplace Transform Consideration**: Applying the Laplace transform to the system equation would convert it into an algebraic equation in the s-domain.
