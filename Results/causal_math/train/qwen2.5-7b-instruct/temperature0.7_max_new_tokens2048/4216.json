However, for the purpose of this analysis, we will focus on the general form.\n\n2. **Perturbed System**: If a perturbation matrix \\( D \\) is added to the system, the new state becomes \\( y'(t) = (C + D) e^{At} \\). The Laplace transform of the new state is:\n   \\[\n   F'(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y'(t)\\}(s) = (C + D) \\frac{1}{s - A}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Comparison of \\( F(s) \\) and \\( F'(s) \\)**: We need to compare \\( F(s) \\) and \\( F'(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   F(s) = C \\frac{1}{s - A}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   F'(s) = (C + D) \\frac{1}{s - A}\n   \\]\n   By comparing these two expressions, we can see that:\n   \\[\n   F'(s) = F(s) + \\frac{D}{s - A}\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   F'(s) - F(s) = \\frac{D}{s - A}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determining \\( D \\)**: To determine \\( D \\), we would need to know \\( F(s) \\) and \\( F'(s) \\). From the above equation, we can solve for \\( D \\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   D = (s - A)(F'(s) - F(s))\n   \\]\n   Since \\( s - A \\) is invertible (assuming \\( s \\) is not an eigenvalue of \\( A \\)), we can uniquely determine \\( D \\) from the difference \\( F'(s) - F(s) \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we can indeed determine the exact form of the perturbation matrix \\( D \\) just by comparing the original \\( F(s) \\) and the new \\( F'(s) \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
