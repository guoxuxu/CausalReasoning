Generally, this is not true for arbitrary \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( C \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \\( u'(x,t) \\) does not generally satisfy the heat equation, applying \\( g(u) \\) and then evolving under the heat equation will result in a different temperature distribution compared to just evolving \\( u_0(x) \\) under the heat equation.\n\nTherefore, the application of \\( g(u) \\) changes the temperature distribution at a later time \\( t = T \\) compared to just letting \\( u_0(x) \\) evolve under the heat equation.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether applying the transformation \\( g(u) = u + Ce^{\\lambda t} \\) changes the temperature distribution at a later time \\( t = T \\) compared to just letting the initial temperature distribution \\( u_0(x) \\) evolve under the heat equation, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Condition Transformation**: Apply the transformation \\( g(u) \\) to the initial condition \\( u_0(x) \\).\n   - The transformed initial condition is \\( u'(x,0) = u_0(x) + Ce^{\\lambda \\cdot 0} = u_0(x) + C \\).\n\n2. **Evolution Under Heat Equation**:\n   - Without the transformation, the solution to the heat equation starting from \\( u_0(x) \\) is \\( u(x,t) \\).\n   - With the transformation, the solution starts from \\( u'(x,0) = u_0(x) + C \\). Let’s denote this new solution as \\( u'(x,t) \\).\n\n3. **Heat Equation Solution Form**:\n   - The general solution to the heat equation for the transformed initial condition can be written as \\( u'(x,t) = u_0(x) + C + \\text{(terms involving } e^{-k\\lambda^2t}\\text{)} \\).\n   - Specifically, if we assume the form of the solution is \\( u'(x,t) = u_0(x) + C + f(t) \\), where \\( f(t) \\) involves terms that decay over time due to the heat diffusion process.\n\n4. **Comparison at Time \\( t = T \\)**:\n   - At time \\( t = T \\), the solution without the transformation is \\( u(x,T) \\).\n   - The solution with the transformation is \\( u'(x,T) = u_0(x) + C + f(T) \\).\n\n5. **Effect of Transformation**:\n   - The term \\( C \\) remains constant over time.\n   - The term \\( f(T) \\) represents the effect of the heat diffusion process, which will generally be different from the original solution \\( u(x,T) \\) due to the additional constant \\( C \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the application of \\( g(u) \\) does indeed change the temperature distribution at a later time \\( t = T \\) compared to just letting \\( u_0(x) \\) evolve under the heat equation.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
