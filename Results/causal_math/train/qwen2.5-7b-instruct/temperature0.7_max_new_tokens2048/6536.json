The Laplace transform of this new function would be \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} h(t)x(t) dt \\), which generally does not have a simple relation to the original transform \\( u_x(z) \\) unless \\( h(t) \\) has specific properties.\n\n3. **Effect of Addition of Another Function**: If \\( x(t) \\) is modified to \\( y(t) = x(t) + w(t) \\), the new Laplace transform \\( u_y(z) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   u_y(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} (x(t) + w(t)) dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} x(t) dt + \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} w(t) dt = u_x(z) + u_w(z)\n   \\]\n   where \\( u_w(z) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( w(t) \\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness of \\( w(t) \\)**: Given \\( u_x(z) \\) and \\( u_y(z) \\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   u_y(z) = u_x(z) + u_w(z)\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( u_w(z) \\):\n   \\[\n   u_w(z) = u_y(z) - u_x(z)\n   \\]\n   From \\( u_w(z) \\), we can potentially recover \\( w(t) \\) if we know that the inverse Laplace transform exists and is unique for the given \\( w(t) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Knowing \\( u_x(z) \\) and \\( u_y(z) \\) allows us to determine \\( u_w(z) \\), but whether \\( w(t) \\) can be uniquely identified depends on the uniqueness of the inverse Laplace transform. Generally, if \\( w(t) \\) is well-defined and its Laplace transform is unique, then \\( w(t) \\) can be uniquely identified.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the function \\( w(t) \\) can be uniquely identified given only the transforms \\( u_x(z) \\) and \\( u_y(z) \\), let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Transform**: The initial transform of \\( x(t) \\) is given as:\n   \\[\n   u_x(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} x(t) dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Transform with Addition**: When we add \\( w(t) \\) to \\( x(t) \\), the new function \\( y(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = x(t) + w(t)\n   \\]\n   The transform of \\( y(t) \\) is then:\n   \\[\n   u_y(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} y(t) dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} (x(t) + w(t)) dt\n   \\]\n   This can be split into two parts:\n   \\[\n   u_y(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} x(t) dt + \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} w(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Recognizing that the first integral is \\( u_x(z) \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   u_y(z) = u_x(z) + \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} w(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Let \\( u_w(z) \\) represent the transform of \\( w(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   u_w(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} w(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   u_y(z) = u_x(z) + u_w(z)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Uniqueness of \\( w(t) \\)**: From the equation above, it is clear that \\( u_w(z) \\) is the difference between \\( u_y(z) \\) and \\( u_x(z) \\):\n   \\[\n   u_w(z) = u_y(z) - u_x(z)\n   \\]\n   If we know \\( u_x(z) \\) and \\( u_y(z) \\), we can uniquely determine \\( u_w(z) \\). However, the inverse Laplace transform is not always unique unless additional constraints are provided. In general, without further information about \\( w(t) \\), there could be multiple functions that have the same Laplace transform \\( u_w(z) \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given only \\( u_x(z) \\) and \\( u_y(z) \\), we can find \\( u_w(z) \\) but cannot uniquely determine \\( w(t) \\) because the inverse Laplace transform is not one-to-one. There could be many different functions \\( w(t) \\) that result in the same \\( u_w(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
