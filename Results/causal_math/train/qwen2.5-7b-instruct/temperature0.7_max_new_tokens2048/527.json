If we apply \\( h(t) \\) to \\( z_g \\), it would imply integrating back to the original form of \\( f(t) \\).\n\n4. **Effect of \\( h(t) \\) on \\( z_g \\)**:\n   - To see if \\( h(t) \\) isolates the effect of \\( s \\), we need to check if applying \\( h(t) \\) to \\( z_g \\) results in a form that only reflects \\( s \\) and not the transformations.\n   - The transformation \\( h(t) \\) essentially divides by \\( t^2 \\), which means we are trying to reverse the \\( t^2 \\) factor in \\( z_g \\).\n\n5. **Recalculating \\( z \\) after Intervention**:\n   - If we apply \\( h(t) \\) to \\( z_g \\), we get back to the form of \\( z \\) because \\( h(t) \\) undoes the multiplication by \\( t^2 \\).\n   - Therefore, the resulting function after applying \\( h(t) \\) to \\( z_g \\) would be \\( \\int_0^T e^{st} f(t) \\, dt \\), which is exactly \\( z \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since applying \\( h(t) \\) to \\( z_g \\) recovers the original form \\( z \\), the effect of \\( s \\) is indeed isolated, and the recalculated \\( z \\) will only reflect the effect of \\( s \\) and not the transformations introduced by \\( g(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
