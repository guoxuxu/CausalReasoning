In the context of Fourier transforms, the solution in the frequency domain for a harmonic function is particularly simple.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of the Laplace Equation**: When we take the Fourier transform of the Laplace equation, we get \\(-k_x^2 K(k_x, k_y) - k_y^2 K(k_x, k_y) = 0\\), which simplifies to \\(-k_x^2 - k_y^2 K(k_x, k_y) = 0\\).
