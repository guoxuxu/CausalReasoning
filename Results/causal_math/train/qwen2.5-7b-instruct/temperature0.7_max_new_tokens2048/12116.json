    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\)\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1 dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral does not converge in the usual sense because it is the integral of a constant function over the entire real line. However, in the context of distributions (or generalized functions), the Fourier transform of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) is known to be \\( 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n3. **Differential Equation**:\n   - Given \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), for \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\dot{z}(t) = i\\omega e^{i\\omega t}\n     \\]\n   - This confirms that \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is indeed a solution to the differential equation.\n\n4. **Transformed Function**:\n   - After applying the Fourier transform, we have \\( F(z)(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\).\n   - When this function evolves according to the differential equation, it remains unchanged because the differential equation only affects \\( z(t) \\) directly, not its Fourier transform.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Fourier transform \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) is non-zero and specifically concentrated at \\( \\omega \\).\n   - It will not become zero at any time \\( t \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The function given is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is calculated as follows:\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{i\\omega t} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1 \\, dt.\n     \\]\n   - This integral diverges because it integrates a constant (1) over the entire real line, which does not converge to a finite value. Therefore, the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is not well-defined in the usual sense.\n\n3. **Differential Equation**:\n   - The differential equation governing \\( z(t) \\) is \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).\n   - For \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), we can verify that:\n     \\[\n     \\dot{z} = i\\omega e^{i\\omega t} = i\\omega z.\n     \\]\n   - This confirms that \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is indeed a solution to the differential equation.\n\n4. **Evolution of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - If \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\), it remains \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) for all times \\( t \\).\n\n5. **Transformed Function**:\n   - Since the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is not well-defined, we cannot directly apply the Fourier transform to \\( z(t) \\) and expect a meaningful result.\n   - Even if we hypothetically consider the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\), the Fourier transform of a function that is a complex exponential would typically be a Dirac delta function, but due to the divergence issue mentioned earlier, this interpretation is not valid here.\n\nGiven these steps, we conclude that the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is not defined in a conventional manner, and thus it does not make sense to ask if the transformed function at any time \\( t \\) will be zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
