For \\(M\\) to be detectable, it must affect the dynamics of the system in a way that is not solely due to \\(L\\).\n\n5. **Impact of \\(M\\)**: If \\(M\\) were present, it would modify the PDE to something like \\(\\partial_t u = (L + M)u\\).

The effect of \\(M\\) on the system would be integrated over time, and without knowing how the system evolved over the entire time interval [0, T], we cannot uniquely determine \\(M\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Given only the final state \\(u(x,T)\\), we cannot unequivocally determine the presence and effects of the intervention operator \\(M\\).
