    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The differential equation is \\( \\frac{d}{dz}w = Mw \\).\n2. The general solution to this equation is \\( w(z) = Ce^{Mz} \\), where C is a constant vector.\n3. Given the function \\( f(z) = e^{Kz} \\), we need to consider how it might affect the solutions.\n4.
