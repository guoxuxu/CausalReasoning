This describes how the temperature \\( u \\) changes with respect to time \\( t \\) and position \\( x \\).\n\n2. **External Heat Source Transformation**: The problem introduces an external heat source via the transformation \\( f(u) = u + h(t) \\). This means that the temperature at any point is being increased by the function \\( h(t) \\) which depends on time.\n\n3. **Determine Initial Condition**: To find the initial condition \\( u_0 \\), we need to know the temperature distribution at the initial time, typically \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Effect of \\( h(t) \\)**: Since \\( h(t) \\) is added to the temperature \\( u \\), it modifies the temperature at each point over time. However, the initial condition \\( u_0 \\) would be the temperature distribution before any external heating starts, i.e., at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Without Knowing \\( h(t) \\)**: If we do not know the specific form of \\( h(t) \\), we cannot directly determine how much the initial temperature was modified. We only know that the temperature at any time \\( T \\) is the initial temperature plus the integral of \\( h(t) \\) from 0 to \\( T \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without the specific function \\( h(t) \\), we cannot uniquely determine the initial condition \\( u_0 \\) because \\( u(T) \\) includes the cumulative effect of \\( h(t) \\) up to time \\( T \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

The given partial differential equation (PDE) for the temperature change is:\n   \\[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\]\n\n2. The transformation due to an external heat source is:\n   \\[ f(u) = u + h(t) \\]\n   This implies that the actual temperature \\( u \\) is modified by \\( h(t) \\).\n\n3. To find the initial condition \\( u_0 \\), we need to consider the state of the system at \\( t = 0 \\). Let's denote the temperature at \\( t = 0 \\) as \\( u_0(x) \\).\n\n4. At \\( t = 0 \\), the transformed temperature \\( f(u_0) \\) would be:\n   \\[ f(u_0) = u_0 + h(0) \\]\n\n5.
