This function transforms the input voltage \\(V(t)\\) into a new voltage signal \\(V'(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   V'(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} h(\\tau) V(t - \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   For \\(t \\geq 0\\), this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   V'(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-\\alpha (t - \\tau)} V(\\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\(t_1\\)**: At some time \\(t_1 < T\\), the resistance \\(R\\) is suddenly changed to a new value \\(R'\\). This change affects the differential equation as follows:\n   \\[\n   L \\frac{dI}{dt} + R'I = V'(t)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Effect of Impulse Response**: The transformation \\(h(t)\\) modifies the input voltage \\(V(t)\\) to \\(V'(t)\\). Therefore, the new differential equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   L \\frac{dI}{dt} + R'I = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-\\alpha (t - \\tau)} V(\\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Current Analysis**: To determine if the final current \\(I(T)\\) depends solely on the initial setup, we need to consider both the original and transformed inputs. The impulse response \\(h(t)\\) affects the input voltage \\(V(t)\\) through convolution, which means the new input \\(V'(t)\\) is not just \\(V(t)\\) but a modified version of it. Therefore, the current \\(I(T)\\) will be influenced by the transformation \\(h(t)\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the final current \\(I(T)\\) is determined by the new differential equation involving \\(V'(t)\\), which includes the effect of the impulse response \\(h(t)\\), the final current cannot be independent of the transformation \\(h(t)\\)'s effect on \\(V(t)\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
