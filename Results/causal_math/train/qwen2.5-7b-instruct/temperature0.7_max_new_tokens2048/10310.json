    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Given Function and Integral Transformation:**\n   - \\( z(w) = e^{iAw} \\)\n   - \\( Z(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(w)e^{-sw} dw \\)\n\n2. **Understanding \\( Z(s) \\):**\n   - \\( Z(s) \\) is a Laplace-like transform of \\( z(w) \\).\n   - It depends on the complex parameter \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Reversing the Transform:**\n   - To determine if we can uniquely find \\( z(w_0) \\) from \\( Z(s) \\), we need to consider the inverse process.\n   - The inverse of the Laplace transform for functions like \\( z(w) \\) is generally not straightforward without additional information about \\( z(w) \\).\n\n4. **Analyzing \\( z(w) \\):**\n   - \\( z(w) = e^{iAw} \\) suggests that it is an exponential function with a complex argument.\n   - This form does not directly suggest a simple inverse transform without more context about \\( A \\) and \\( w \\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Determination:**\n   - For \\( Z(s) \\) to uniquely determine \\( z(w_0) \\), we would need a unique inversion formula or a specific property of \\( z(w) \\).\n   - In general, the Laplace transform (or similar integral transforms) does not provide a one-to-one correspondence between \\( Z(s) \\) and \\( z(w) \\) without additional constraints.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional constraints or specific properties of \\( A \\) and \\( w \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( z(w_0) \\) from \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the given function**: \n   - The function \\( z(w) = e^{iAw} \\) where \\( A \\) is a complex constant matrix and \\( w \\) is a complex variable.\n   \n2. **Integral transformation**:\n   - We need to compute \\( Z(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(w)e^{-sw} dw \\).\n   - Substituting \\( z(w) = e^{iAw} \\) into the integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iAw} e^{-sw} dw = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(iA - s)w} dw\n     \\]\n   - This integral is a Fourier-like transform. For it to converge, the real part of \\( iA - s \\) must be negative, ensuring that the exponential term decays as \\( w \\to \\pm \\infty \\).\n\n3. **Convergence and existence of \\( Z(s) \\)**:\n   - The integral converges if the real part of \\( s - iA \\) is positive, meaning \\( \\text{Re}(s) > \\text{Re}(-iA) \\).\n   - Assuming this condition holds, \\( Z(s) \\) exists and can be computed.\n\n4. **Recovering \\( z(w) \\) from \\( Z(s) \\)**:\n   - To determine if \\( z(w_0) \\) can be uniquely determined from \\( Z(s) \\), we need to consider the inverse relationship.\n   - The inverse transform would involve a similar integral but with a different kernel. Specifically, the inverse transform would look like:\n     \\[\n     z(w) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{\\gamma} Z(s) e^{sw} ds\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\gamma \\) is a contour in the complex plane chosen such that the integral converges.\n   - However, for a specific point \\( w_0 \\), we would need to evaluate this integral at \\( w = w_0 \\):\n     \\[\n     z(w_0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{\\gamma} Z(s) e^{sw_0} ds\n     \\]\n\n5. **Uniqueness**:\n   - The uniqueness of \\( z(w_0) \\) depends on the properties of \\( Z(s) \\). If \\( Z(s) \\) is known and the integral can be evaluated uniquely for any \\( w_0 \\), then \\( z(w_0) \\) can be determined uniquely.\n   - However, without additional information about the form of \\( Z(s) \\) and the specific contour \\( \\gamma \\), it is not generally possible to uniquely determine \\( z(w_0) \\) from \\( Z(s) \\) alone.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the original function \\( z(w) \\) at \\( w = w_0 \\) cannot be uniquely determined solely from \\( Z(s) \\) without more information.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
