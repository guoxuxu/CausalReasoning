For a function \\( u(t) \\), its Laplace transform is defined as:\n   \\[\n   U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} u(t) dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention: Multiplying by \\( e^{st} \\):**\n   We introduce an intervention where we multiply \\( u(t) \\) by \\( e^{st} \\). Let's denote the new function as \\( v(t) = u(t) e^{st} \\).\n\n4. **Laplace Transform of \\( v(t) \\):**\n   We need to find the Laplace transform of \\( v(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   V(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t) e^{st}\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the frequency shift property of the Laplace transform, which states that:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at} f(t)\\} = F(s-a)\n   \\]\n   where \\( F(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   V(s) = U(s-s)\n   \\]\n   This means:\n   \\[\n   V(s) = U(s-st)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Effect on \\( U(s) \\):**\n   The transformed function \\( U(s) \\) will now be \\( U(s-st) \\). This shows that the transformed function depends on the parameter \\( s \\) through the term \\( s-st \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The transformed function \\( U(s) \\) does not only depend on the parameters of the original differential equation (which are 2 and 5 in this case) but also on the parameter \\( s \\) itself, due to the multiplication by \\( e^{st} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
