    "To address this question, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understanding Analytic Functions and Cauchy-Riemann Equations**:\n   - A function \\( f(z) \\) is analytic in a region if it is differentiable at every point in that region.\n   - For a function \\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\) to be analytic, the Cauchy-Riemann equations must hold: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Transformation Consideration**:\n   - The transformation \\( T(z) = z^2 \\) maps points from the complex plane to other points in the same plane.\n   - If \\( f(z) \\) is analytic, then \\( g(z) = f(z^2) \\) is also analytic because the composition of analytic functions is analytic.\n\n3. **Analyticity of \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   - Since \\( g(z) = f(z^2) \\) is analytic, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations in terms of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) when considering \\( z^2 \\).\n\n4. **Relating \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   - To determine if every point in \\( f(z) \\) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we need to express \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) for \\( f(z) \\).\n   - Given \\( z = x + iy \\), then \\( z^2 = (x + iy)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy \\). Thus, \\( u(x^2 - y^2, 2xy) \\) and \\( v(x^2 - y^2, 2xy) \\) are the real and imaginary parts of \\( g(z) \\).\n\n5. **Checking Cauchy-Riemann for \\( f(z) \\)**:\n   - The Cauchy-Riemann equations for \\( f(z) \\) are satisfied if:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}.\n     \\]\n   - For \\( g(z) = f(z^2) \\), these conditions are already verified since \\( g(z) \\) is analytic.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Knowing that \\( g(z) \\) satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations means that the partial derivatives of \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) with respect to \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) satisfy the necessary conditions.\n   - Therefore, the original function \\( f(z) \\) must also satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations in its own domain because the transformation \\( T(z) = z^2 \\) does not alter the fundamental analytic nature of \\( f(z) \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Analyticity**: We start with an analytic function \\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\).

Applying this transformation to \\( f(z) \\) results in a new function \\( g(z) = f(z^2) \\).\n\n3. **Analyticity of Transformed Function**: For \\( g(z) = f(z^2) \\) to be analytic, it must also satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations in terms of the variables of \\( z^2 \\). If \\( f(z) \\) is analytic, then the chain rule and the properties of analytic functions imply that \\( g(z) \\) will also be analytic.\n\n4. **Implication for Original Function**: If \\( g(z) = f(z^2) \\) is known to be analytic, it does not directly provide information about the analyticity of \\( f(z) \\) at every point. However, since \\( f(z) \\) was originally assumed to be analytic, and the transformation \\( z^2 \\) is a conformal mapping (which preserves angles and thus local behavior), the analyticity of \\( g(z) \\) does not change the fact that \\( f(z) \\) is analytic where it was originally defined.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Knowing that \\( g(z) = f(z^2) \\) is analytic does not give us new information about the analyticity of \\( f(z) \\) because \\( f(z) \\) was already assumed to be analytic.
