    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition and PDE**: We start with the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\) and evolve it over time according to the PDE \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\cdot \\nabla u = 0 \\). This PDE describes a linear advection equation where \\( u \\) is advected at a constant velocity \\( a \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transformation**: The Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(u(x, t)) \\) of \\( u(x, t) \\) is a tool that decomposes the spatial distribution of \\( u \\) into its frequency components. Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\) gives us \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) \\), which represents the frequency spectrum of \\( u \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Evolution of Transformed Function**: When we apply the Fourier transform to the evolved function \\( u(x, T) \\), we get \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, T) \\). For the given PDE, the solution in Fourier space is straightforward due to the linearity and the form of the equation. Specifically, \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, T) = \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) e^{-i a \\cdot \\xi T} \\), where \\( \\xi \\) is the frequency variable.\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To recover \\( u(x, T) \\) from \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, T) \\), we would need to take the inverse Fourier transform. However, this does not directly give us \\( u(x, 0) \\) without additional information about the evolution process.\n\n5. **Deduction of Initial Condition**: The key point here is whether we can deduce \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\) alone, without knowing if the Fourier transform was initially applied. The answer is no because:\n   - The PDE and its solution do not provide enough information to uniquely determine the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\).\n   - Without knowledge of whether the Fourier transform was applied initially, there could be multiple possible initial conditions that lead to the same evolved state \\( u(x, T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE**: The given PDE is a linear advection equation \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\cdot \\nabla u = 0\\). This equation describes how a quantity \\(u\\) changes over time due to a constant velocity field \\(a\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to the initial condition \\(u(x, 0)\\) gives us \\(\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\), where \\(k\\) is the wave number.\n\n3. **Transformed PDE**: When the Fourier transform is applied, the PDE transforms into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time. Specifically, \\(\\frac{d\\hat{u}(k, t)}{dt} = -a \\cdot k \\hat{u}(k, t)\\).\n\n4. **Solution of the ODE**: Solving this ODE, we get \\(\\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-a \\cdot k t}\\).\n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find \\(u(x, t)\\), we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of \\(\\hat{u}(k, t)\\). This gives us \\(u(x, t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k, t)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-a \\cdot k t}]\\).\n\n6. **Final Form at Time \\(T\\)**: At time \\(T\\), we have \\(u(x, T) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-a \\cdot k T}]\\).\n\n7. **Inversion Problem**: Given \\(u(x, T)\\), can we uniquely determine \\(\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\)? Yes, because the Fourier transform is a one-to-one operation, and we can invert it to recover the original function up to a constant factor (if any).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Knowing \\(u(x, T)\\) allows us to determine \\(\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\) through the inverse Fourier transform. Since \\(\\hat{u}(k, 0)\\) is the Fourier transform of \\(u(x, 0)\\), we can then determine \\(u(x, 0)\\) as well.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
