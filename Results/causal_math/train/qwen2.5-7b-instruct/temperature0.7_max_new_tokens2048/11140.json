The influence of \\(v(x, y)\\) and \\(w(x, y)\\) on \\(u(x, y)\\) is through the boundary conditions, but these boundary conditions could be complex and not uniquely determined by the internal potential alone.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given only the internal potential \\(u(x, y)\\) at \\(t = T\\), it is not possible to definitively determine whether \\(v(x, y)\\), \\(w(x, y)\\), or both were applied as boundary conditions. There could be multiple combinations of boundary conditions that result in the same internal potential.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether \\(v(x, y)\\) and/or \\(w(x, y)\\) were applied on the boundary given the internal potential \\(u(x, y)\\) at time \\(t = T\\), let's analyze the situation step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a two-dimensional region governed by the Laplace equation \\(\\nabla^2 u = 0\\).\n   - The boundary conditions are modified by functions \\(v(x, y)\\) and \\(w(x, y)\\).\n   - Specifically, \\(v(x, y) = e^{i\\omega(x+y)}\\) is applied.\n   - We know the internal potential \\(u(x, y)\\) at time \\(t = T\\).\n\n2. **Boundary Conditions and Their Effects:**\n   - The function \\(v(x, y)\\) is explicitly known and its form suggests a sinusoidal perturbation along the line \\(x + y = c\\) (for some constant \\(c\\)).\n   - If \\(w(x, y)\\) were also applied, it would be another function that modifies the boundary conditions.\n\n3. **Influence of Boundary Conditions on the Solution:**\n   - The solution to the Laplace equation with boundary conditions depends on the specific form of those boundary conditions.\n   - Given that we only know \\(u(x, y)\\) internally and not the exact boundary values, we need to consider how the boundary conditions influence the internal potential.\n\n4. **Determining the Influence of \\(v(x, y)\\):**\n   - Since \\(v(x, y) = e^{i\\omega(x+y)}\\) is a specific form of boundary condition, its influence can be analyzed using the method of images or other techniques for solving the Laplace equation with complex boundary conditions.\n   - The presence of \\(v(x, y)\\) will introduce a specific pattern in the internal potential \\(u(x, y)\\).\n\n5. **Determining the Influence of \\(w(x, y)\\):**\n   - If \\(w(x, y)\\) were applied, it would add another term to the boundary conditions, potentially altering the internal potential in a different way.\n   - Without additional information about \\(w(x, y)\\), we cannot definitively say whether it was applied or not based solely on the internal potential \\(u(x, y)\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Knowing \\(u(x, y)\\) at \\(t = T\\) allows us to determine the influence of \\(v(x, y)\\) because its specific form is known.\n   - However, without further information about \\(w(x, y)\\) and its specific form, we cannot determine if it was applied or not.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is that we can determine the influence of \\(v(x, y)\\) but not necessarily \\(w(x, y)\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
