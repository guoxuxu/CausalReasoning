    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Its Laplace Transform:**\n   - The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{it}\\}(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\).\n\n2. **Modification at Time \\( t_1 \\):**\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), the transformed function changes from \\( \\frac{1}{s-i} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{(s-i)^2} \\).\n\n3. **Understanding the Impact of the Modification:**\n   - The Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{it}\\}(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\) implies that the original function is \\( e^{it} \\).\n   - Changing the transformed function to \\( \\frac{1}{(s-i)^2} \\) indicates that the modified function has a higher order pole at \\( s = i \\).
