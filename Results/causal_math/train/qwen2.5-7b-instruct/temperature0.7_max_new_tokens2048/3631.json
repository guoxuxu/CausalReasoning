This means there exists an invertible matrix \\(P\\) such that \\(A' = P^{-1}AP\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer depends on whether \\(A'\\) is similar to \\(A\\).

Substituting \\( Tx \\) into the quadratic form, we get:\n   \\[\n   Q(Tx) = (Tx)^T A (Tx)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Matrix Multiplication Properties**: Using the properties of matrix multiplication, specifically that \\( (AB)^T = B^T A^T \\), we can rewrite the above expression as:\n   \\[\n   Q(Tx) = x^T T^T A T x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Symmetry of \\( A \\)**: Since \\( A \\) is symmetric, \\( A = A^T \\).
