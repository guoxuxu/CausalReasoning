    "To determine whether it's possible to definitively identify which transforms (H, G, or both) were applied to the function \\(z(t)\\) based solely on the observed state at \\(z(T)\\), let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Hilbert Transform**: The Hilbert transform \\(H\\) shifts each frequency component by \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).
