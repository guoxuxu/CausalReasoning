    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\).\n\n2. **Modification at Midpoint**: At a specific midpoint \\( t_1 \\), the function is modified by multiplying with \\( e^{-kt} \\). This changes the function to:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = e^{it} \\cdot e^{-kt} = e^{i t - k t} = e^{(i-k)t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Laplace Transform**: Apply the Laplace transform to \\( z'(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   Z'(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{(i-k)t}\\} = \\frac{1}{s - (i-k)}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: Now, apply the inverse Laplace transform to \\( Z'(s) \\) to get back to the time domain:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s - (i-k)}\\right\\} = e^{(i-k)t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**: Compare this result with the original function \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{it}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s - (i-k)}\\right\\} = e^{(i-k)t}\n   \\]\n\nClearly, the result after the Laplace transform and its inverse is not the same as the original function \\( z(t) \\) unless \\( k = 0 \\). If \\( k \\neq 0 \\), the phase shift in the exponent will change the function.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
