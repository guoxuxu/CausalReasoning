The force will cause a change in the velocity field over time, and this change will propagate through the fluid.\n\n2. **Pressure Gradient Term (-\\(\\nabla p\\))**: This term represents the pressure gradient forces which act on the fluid. While it affects the velocity field, it is not directly controlled by the applied force \\(\\vec{f}\\).\n\n3. **Viscous Diffusion Term (\\(\\nu \\nabla^2 \\vec{u}\\))**: This term describes the effect of viscosity on the velocity field.

    "To determine if the final velocity field \\(\\vec{u}(x, y, T)\\) depends only on the applied force \\(\\vec{f}\\) and not on the initial conditions or viscosity, we need to analyze the given information step-by-step.\n\n1. **Navier-Stokes Equation**: The governing equation for the velocity field \\(\\vec{u}\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\vec{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\vec{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\vec{u} + \\vec{f}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(\\vec{f}\\) is the external force, \\(p\\) is the pressure, and \\(\\nu\\) is the viscosity.\n\n2. **External Force Influence**: The term \\(\\vec{f}\\) directly influences the velocity field \\(\\vec{u}\\). When \\(\\vec{f}\\) is applied, it affects the acceleration of the fluid particles and hence the velocity field.\n\n3. **Pressure Gradient Influence**: The term \\(-\\nabla p\\) represents the pressure gradient force. This term is influenced by the velocity field itself through the convective term \\((\\vec{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\vec{u}\\). However, the presence of \\(\\vec{f}\\) can alter the pressure distribution, thus affecting \\(\\nabla p\\).\n\n4. **Viscosity Influence**: The term \\(\\nu \\nabla^2 \\vec{u}\\) represents the viscous diffusion term. Viscosity affects how the velocity field changes over space. Higher viscosity means that the fluid resists deformation more, leading to smoother velocity profiles.\n\n5. **Initial Conditions**: Initial conditions set the starting point of the system. They influence the transient behavior of the system but do not affect the steady-state behavior if the system reaches a steady state. If the system is driven by an external force \\(\\vec{f}\\) continuously from \\(t = t_1\\) to \\(T\\), the initial conditions will have less impact on the final state, especially if the system has enough time to reach a steady state under the influence of \\(\\vec{f}\\).\n\n6. **Steady-State Consideration**: For a sufficiently long duration \\(T - t_1\\), the system might reach a steady state where the time derivative term \\(\\frac{\\partial \\vec{u}}{\\partial t}\\) becomes negligible. In this case, the system's state would primarily depend on the balance between the convective term, the pressure gradient term, the viscous diffusion term, and the external force \\(\\vec{f}\\).\n\nGiven these points, while the initial conditions and viscosity play roles in the transient behavior, they do not fundamentally alter the final steady-state velocity field when the system is driven by a continuous external force.

When an external force \\(\\vec{f}\\) is applied, it directly influences the velocity field \\(\\vec{u}\\). This is evident from the first term in the Navier-Stokes equation.\n\n4. The pressure gradient \\(\\nabla p\\) is also affected by the velocity field \\(\\vec{u}\\), but it can be seen as a response to the velocity field rather than an independent factor that would solely determine the final velocity field.\n\n5. Viscosity \\(\\nu\\) affects the acceleration of the fluid through the Laplacian term \\(\\nabla^2 \\vec{u}\\), but it does not independently set the velocity field; instead, it modifies how the velocity field changes over time.\n\n6. Initial conditions can affect the transient behavior of the system, but they do not persistently influence the final state if the system reaches a steady state or a new equilibrium.\n\n7. Given that the external force \\(\\vec{f}\\) is applied for a finite duration and continues until time \\(T\\), the system will evolve according to the Navier-Stokes equation with this constant forcing.\n\n8.
