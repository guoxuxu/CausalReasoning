    "To address this question, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Transform**: The original Laplace transform \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + as + b} \\) corresponds to some function \\( z(x) \\).

Changing the coefficients \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\) changes the roots of the polynomial, which fundamentally alters the nature of the function \\( z(x) \\) (assuming \\( a \\neq a' \\) or \\( b \\neq b' \\)).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Generally, for the inverse Laplace transform to yield the same function \\( z(x) \\) at \\( x = T \\) after modifying \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) to \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\), the new function \\( z'(x) \\) must be identical to the original function \\( z(x) \\). However, unless \\( a' = a \\) and \\( b' = b \\), the functions \\( z(x) \\) and \\( z'(x) \\) are not the same.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
