    "To address the question, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Transformation**:\n   - The initial function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n   - Applying the Laplace transform, we get \\( Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\).\n\n2. **Intervention Analysis**:\n   - An intervention modifies \\( \\omega \\) to \\( \\omega' \\) at a specific time \\( t_1 \\).\n   - We need to determine if the Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) calculated for \\( t > t_1 \\) will exclusively reflect \\( \\omega' \\) and not the original \\( \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Impact of the Intervention**:\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\), the system operates with \\( \\omega \\).\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), the system switches to \\( \\omega' \\).\n   - The Laplace transform is a linear operation that considers the entire history of the function up to the point of transformation. However, it does not inherently have memory of past values beyond the current state due to its nature of integrating future behavior based on the current state.\n\n4. **Laplace Transform Calculation Post-Intervention**:\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the function \\( z(t) \\) becomes \\( e^{i\\omega' (t - t_1)} \\) because the change occurs at \\( t_1 \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) after \\( t_1 \\) would be \\( Z(s) = \\frac{e^{-i\\omega' t_1}}{s - i\\omega'} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Laplace transform calculated at any \\( t > t_1 \\) will indeed reflect the new value \\( \\omega' \\) because the transform considers the function's behavior from \\( t_1 \\) onwards.\n   - It will not reflect the original \\( \\omega \\) because the system has transitioned to \\( \\omega' \\) after \\( t_1 \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
