However, since the exact form of \\(Q\\) and the nature of the boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, etc.) are not specified, we cannot fully determine the impact on the system.\n\n4. **Observing \\(u(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\)**: If we observe \\(u(t)\\) at some later time \\(t = T\\), the information about the initial state \\(u_0\\) can be affected by the boundary condition if it was applied. However, without knowing the exact form of \\(h(u)\\) and its application, we cannot conclusively infer \\(u_0\\) from \\(u(T)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the lack of specific details about \\(Q\\) and the exact nature of the boundary condition, it is not possible to conclusively infer the initial state \\(u_0\\) just from observing \\(u(t)\\) at time \\(t = T\\) without knowing if \\(h(u)\\) was applied initially.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
