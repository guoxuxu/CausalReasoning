    "To determine if the resultant Fourier spectrum \\(H(z)(\\omega)\\) allows for the reconstruction of the original function \\(z(t)\\), let's break down the steps and analyze the transformations involved.\n\n1. **Initial Function and Fourier Transform:**\n   - We start with \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\) is given by \\(F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\).\n\n2. **Intervention Transformation:**\n   - An intervention is applied through the transformation \\(H(z)(\\omega) = F(z)(\\omega) + K\\), where \\(K\\) is a constant.\n   - This means that each value of \\(F(z)(\\omega)\\) is shifted by a constant \\(K\\).\n\n3. **Inverse Fourier Transform:**\n   - To reconstruct \\(z(t)\\) from \\(H(z)(\\omega)\\), we would need to apply the inverse Fourier transform:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H(z)(\\omega)e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\(H(z)(\\omega)\\):\n     \\[\n     z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (F(z)(\\omega) + K)e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n     \\]\n   - This can be split into two integrals:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(z)(\\omega)e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega + \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n     \\]\n\n4. **Reconstruction Analysis:**\n   - The first integral \\(\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(z)(\\omega)e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\\) is simply the inverse Fourier transform of \\(F(z)(\\omega)\\), which gives us \\(z(t)\\).\n   - The second integral \\(\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\\) involves integrating a constant \\(K\\) over all frequencies. This integral does not yield a meaningful function in the time domain because it results in a Dirac delta function scaled by \\(K\\), which is not part of the original \\(z(t)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The addition of the constant \\(K\\) in the frequency domain introduces a term that cannot be recovered through the inverse Fourier transform alone. Specifically, the term \\(\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\\) adds a constant phase shift across all frequencies, which is not recoverable without additional information.\n\nTherefore, the resultant Fourier spectrum \\(H(z)(\\omega)\\) does not allow for the exact reconstruction of the original function \\(z(t)\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
