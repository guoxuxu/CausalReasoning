Without knowing the explicit form of \\( K(t, s) \\), we cannot definitively say whether the observed transformed function corresponds uniquely to \\( z(t) = e^{i w_0 t} \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: If \\( K(t, s) \\) were known and had certain properties (like being a delta function or having a specific form that allows unique inversion), then it might be possible to uniquely determine the original function.
