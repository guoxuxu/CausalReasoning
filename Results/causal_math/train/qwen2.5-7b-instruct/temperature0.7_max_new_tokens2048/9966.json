    "To address this question, let's break down the steps and analyze the information provided:\n\n1. **Given Function and Transformation**:\n   - The original function is \\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(x) \\) is given by \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = 2\\pi \\delta(k - w) \\).\n\n2. **Understanding the Fourier Transform Result**:\n   - The result \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = 2\\pi \\delta(k - w) \\) indicates that the frequency content of \\( z(x) \\) is concentrated at \\( k = w \\). This means that the signal \\( z(x) \\) is purely sinusoidal (or complex exponential) with angular frequency \\( w \\).\n\n3. **Inversion of the Fourier Transform**:\n   - According to the inverse Fourier transform, if \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = 2\\pi \\delta(k - w) \\), then \\( z(x) \\) can be recovered using the inverse Fourier transform formula:\n     \\[\n     z(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{F}(z)(k) e^{ikx} dk = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 2\\pi \\delta(k - w) e^{ikx} dk.\n     \\]\n   - By the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, the integral simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     z(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\cdot 2\\pi e^{iwx} = e^{iwx}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the above steps, it is clear that knowing \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(k) = 2\\pi \\delta(k - w) \\) allows us to uniquely determine \\( z(x) = e^{iwx} \\) without needing any additional data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
