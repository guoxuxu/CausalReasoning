Then,\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{Dt}z(t)) = e^{Dt}\\frac{dz}{dt} + De^{Dt}z(t)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\) into the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = e^{Dt}(iCz(t)) + De^{Dt}z(t) = (iC + D)e^{Dt}z(t) = (iC + D)w(t)\n   \\]\n   This shows that the transformed system \\( w(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = (iC + D)w(t)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**: Now, we compare this with the original differential equation for \\( z(t) \\):\n   - Directly evolving \\( z_0 \\) under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\) gives us:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = z_0 e^{iCt}\n     \\]\n   - Evolving \\( z_0 \\) using the transformed system \\( w(t) \\) (which is \\( e^{Dt}z(t) \\)) under \\( \\frac{dw}{dt} = (iC + D)w(t) \\) gives:\n     \\[\n     w(t) = w_0 e^{(iC + D)t}\n     \\]\n     Since \\( w_0 = g(z_0) = z_0 \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     w(t) = z_0 e^{(iC + D)t}\n     \\]\n     Therefore, the final state of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) is:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = z_0 e^{iCT}\n     \\]\n     And the final state of \\( w(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) is:\n     \\[\n     w(T) = z_0 e^{(iC + D)T} = z_0 e^{iCT} e^{DT}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The final states are not identical unless \\( e^{DT} = 1 \\), which implies \\( DT = 2k\\pi i \\) for some integer \\( k \\).

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with a complex number \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) is applied to \\( z_0 \\). This means that at \\( t = 0 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   g(z_0) = e^{D \\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0\n   \\]\n   So, initially, the transformation does not change \\( z_0 \\).\n\n3. **Evolution Under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\)**: Now, let's consider how \\( z(t) \\) evolves under the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\). The solution to this differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z_0 e^{iCt}\n   \\]\n   This is because the general solution to \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\) is \\( z(t) = A e^{iCt} \\), and given \\( z(0) = z_0 \\), we find \\( A = z_0 \\).\n\n4. **Applying Transformation \\( g(z) \\) and Then Evolving**:\n   - First, apply the transformation \\( g(z) \\) to \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     g(z_0) = z_0\n     \\]\n   - Then, let this transformed value evolve under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\):\n     \\[\n     z(t) = z_0 e^{iCt}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Direct Evolution Without Transformation**:\n   - If we directly evolve \\( z_0 \\) under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\) from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = T \\):\n     \\[\n     z(T) = z_0 e^{iCT}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Comparison**:\n   - From the above steps, it is clear that both methods result in the same expression for \\( z(T) \\):\n     \\[\n     z(T) = z_0 e^{iCT}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final state of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) after applying the transformation \\( g(z) \\) and then allowing it to evolve under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\) is identical to evolving \\( z_0 \\) directly under \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = iCz \\) to \\( t = T \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
