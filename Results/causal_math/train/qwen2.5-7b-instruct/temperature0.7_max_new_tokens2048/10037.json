This gives us \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\).\n\n4. **Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions for \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) at \\(t=0\\) play a crucial role in determining their behavior over time. For linear time-invariant systems, the response to any input can be decomposed into a homogeneous solution (due to initial conditions) and a particular solution (due to the input).\n\n5. **Final System States**: The final state of the system in the complex plane (which refers to the values of \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) as \\(t \\to \\infty\\)) will depend not only on the initial states but also on the system's dynamics and any inputs applied over time. Even if the system is initially at rest, the behavior of \\(u(t)\\) and \\(v(t)\\) as \\(t \\to \\infty\\) can be influenced by transient behaviors that decay to the steady-state response.\n\nGiven these considerations, the final system states in the complex plane cannot be determined solely by the initial states because the system's dynamics and any external inputs over time also affect the final states.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
