This is because the Fourier transform of a complex exponential \\( e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\) is a Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\).\n\n3. **Observation of Peaks**: The problem states that the Fourier transform shows two peaks, one at \\( \\omega \\) and another at \\( \\omega + \\eta \\).\n\n4. **Implications of Multiple Peaks**: The presence of multiple peaks suggests that the signal might be composed of more than just a single exponential component. Specifically, it could indicate the presence of additional terms like \\( e^{i(\\omega + \\eta)t} \\).\n\n5. **Possible Interventions**: Given that the Fourier transform has two distinct peaks, we can infer that the original function \\( z(t) \\) was likely modified or combined with another exponential term. For example, if the original function was \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), an intervention could have been to multiply it by another exponential term such as \\( e^{i\\eta t} \\), resulting in \\( e^{i(\\omega + \\eta)t} \\).\n\n6. **Definitive Conclusion**: However, having only the information about the Fourier transform and the presence of two peaks does not provide enough detail to definitively conclude the specific sequence or type of multiplications by exponential functions.
