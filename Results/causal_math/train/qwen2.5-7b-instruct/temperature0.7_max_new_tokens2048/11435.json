The new function \\(g'(z)\\) is entirely defined by the new parameter \\(s + \\delta\\).\n\nTherefore, the final computed value of \\(g(z)\\) after the intervention only depends on the new value of \\(s + \\delta\\) and not on the original \\(s\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function \\( g(z) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z^t \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\n2. **Intervention Analysis**: An intervention changes \\( s \\) to \\( s + \\delta \\) at time \\( t = t_1 \\). This means that for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the function will use \\( s + \\delta \\) instead of \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Intervention**:\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\), the function \\( g(z) \\) will be calculated using \\( s \\).\n   - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the function \\( g(z) \\) will be calculated using \\( s + \\delta \\).\n\n4. **Impact on Final Value**:\n   - The final value of \\( g(z) \\) is the result of integrating over all \\( t \\) from 0 to \\(\\infty\\).\n   - The integral can be split into two parts:\n     \\[\n     g(z) = \\int_{0}^{t_1} e^{-st} z^t \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{-(s+\\delta)t} z^t \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - The first part depends on the original \\( s \\), while the second part depends on the modified \\( s + \\delta \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since both parts of the integral contribute to the final value, the final computed value of \\( g(z) \\) cannot solely depend on the new value \\( s + \\delta \\). It also depends on the original value \\( s \\) for the initial segment of the integration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
