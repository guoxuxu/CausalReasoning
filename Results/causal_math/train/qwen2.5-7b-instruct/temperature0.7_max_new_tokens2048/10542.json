    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Given Function**: \n   The function \\(z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\) represents a sum of two complex exponentials. This form is reminiscent of the Fourier series representation of signals.\n\n2. **Fourier Transformation**:\n   Applying the Fourier transform to \\(z(t)\\) would yield a representation in the frequency domain. Given the form of \\(z(t)\\), it's clear that the Fourier transform will result in a combination of delta functions at \\(\\pm\\omega\\), scaled by the magnitudes of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).

However, the key point here is that the inverse Fourier transform of the modified spectrum will not necessarily give us back the exact original \\(z(t)\\) because the filter \\(H(\\omega)\\) has altered the amplitudes of the frequency components.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Without knowing \\(H(\\omega)\\), we cannot uniquely determine the original \\(z(t)\\) because the filter function could have changed the amplitudes of the frequency components in ways that are not reversible just from the modified spectrum alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the given function**: \n   The function \\( z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t} \\) is already in a form that suggests it might be a Fourier transform of some signal. Let's rewrite it using Euler's formula for clarity:\n   \\[ z(t) = X(\\cos(\\omega t) + i\\sin(\\omega t)) + Y(\\cos(-\\omega t) + i\\sin(-\\omega t)) \\]\n   Since \\(\\cos(-\\omega t) = \\cos(\\omega t)\\) and \\(\\sin(-\\omega t) = -\\sin(\\omega t)\\), we get:\n   \\[ z(t) = (X + Y)\\cos(\\omega t) + i(X - Y)\\sin(\\omega t) \\]\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**:\n   The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) would give us the frequency domain representation.

Filtering changes the spectrum, which means that while we know the general form of the original signal, we don't have the exact amplitudes and phases that were altered by \\( H(\\omega) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Without the exact form of \\( H(\\omega) \\) and the specific modifications it made, it is not possible to unequivocally determine the original \\( z(t) \\).

    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Signal**: The signal \\(z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\) is a sum of two complex exponentials. This form suggests that the signal in the time domain consists of two sinusoidal components with angular frequencies \\(\\omega\\) and \\(-\\omega\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of the Signal**: To find the Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\), we use the definition of the Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i 2\\pi f t} dt\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(z(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}) e^{-i 2\\pi f t} dt\n   \\]\n   This can be split into two integrals:\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = X \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - 2\\pi f)t} dt + Y \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i(\\omega + 2\\pi f)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluating the Integrals**: Each integral represents a Dirac delta function:\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = X \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}) + Y \\delta(f + \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(Z(f)\\) is the Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\).\n\n4. **Applying a Filter Function**: Suppose the filter function is \\(H(\\omega)\\). The modified signal in the frequency domain would be:\n   \\[\n   Z'(f) = H(f) Z(f) = H(f) [X \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}) + Y \\delta(f + \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})]\n   \\]\n   This modifies the amplitudes of the two frequency components.\n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To recover the time-domain signal from \\(Z'(f)\\), we need to perform the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[Z'(f)]\n   \\]\n   Since \\(Z'(f)\\) is a sum of scaled delta functions, the inverse transform will give us:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = X H(\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}) e^{i\\omega t} + Y H(-\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}) e^{-i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determining Original Signal**: From the above expression, we see that knowing \\(z'(t)\\) does not directly reveal \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) because \\(H(\\omega)\\) is applied to these coefficients.

This is a linear combination of two complex exponentials.\n\n2. **Fourier Transformation**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\( z(t) \\):\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( Xe^{i\\omega t} \\) is \\( X \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( Ye^{-i\\omega t} \\) is \\( Y \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) \\).\n   - Therefore, the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( Z(\\omega) = X \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) + Y \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) \\).\n\n3. **Filtering**: Now, the signal is modified by a filter function \\( H(\\omega) \\):\n   - The filtered signal in the frequency domain is \\( H(\\omega)Z(\\omega) = H(\\omega) (X \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) + Y \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0)) \\).\n\n4. **Reversing the Process**: To determine if we can unequivocally determine the original time-domain signal \\( z(t) \\) from the filtered frequency domain signal:\n   - If \\( H(\\omega) \\) does not modify \\( X \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\) and \\( Y \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) \\) differently, then the inverse Fourier transform will recover \\( z(t) \\).\n   - However, if \\( H(\\omega) \\) modifies these components differently, it introduces ambiguity.\n\n5. **Ambiguity Check**:\n   - If \\( H(\\omega) \\) is such that it doesn't change the amplitudes of the impulses but only shifts them or changes their phase, the original signal can still be recovered.\n   - But if \\( H(\\omega) \\) changes the amplitudes or introduces other modifications, the original signal cannot be uniquely determined.\n\nGiven the general form of \\( H(\\omega) \\), without specific details about \\( H(\\omega) \\), we cannot definitively say that the original signal can always be uniquely recovered. There could be cases where \\( H(\\omega) \\) introduces modifications that make recovery ambiguous.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Original Signal**: The given function is \\( z(t) = Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t} \\), where \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are complex constants and \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\(z(t)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{Xe^{i\\omega t} + Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{Xe^{i\\omega t}\\} = X \\cdot 2\\pi \\delta(f - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{Ye^{-i\\omega t}\\} = Y \\cdot 2\\pi \\delta(f + \\omega)\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = 2\\pi (X \\delta(f - \\omega) + Y \\delta(f + \\omega))\n   \\]\n\n3. **Filtering**: The filtered signal is obtained by multiplying the Fourier transform by the filter function \\(H(\\omega)\\):\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{filtered}}(f) = Z(f) \\cdot H(\\omega) = 2\\pi (X \\delta(f - \\omega) + Y \\delta(f + \\omega)) \\cdot H(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{filtered}}(f) = 2\\pi (X H(\\omega) \\delta(f - \\omega) + Y H(-\\omega) \\delta(f + \\omega))\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To determine if we can unequivocally recover the original signal \\(z(t)\\) from the filtered frequency domain signal \\(Z_{\\text{filtered}}(f)\\), we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of \\(Z_{\\text{filtered}}(f)\\):\n   \\[\n   z_{\\text{filtered}}(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{Z_{\\text{filtered}}(f)\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the inverse Fourier transform property for delta functions:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{2\\pi X H(\\omega) \\delta(f - \\omega)\\} = X H(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{2\\pi Y H(-\\omega) \\delta(f + \\omega)\\} = Y H(-\\omega) e^{-i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   z_{\\text{filtered}}(t) = X H(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t} + Y H(-\\omega) e^{-i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**: For \\(z_{\\text{filtered}}(t)\\) to be identical to the original \\(z(t)\\), we must have:\n   \\[\n   H(\\omega) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad H(-\\omega) = 1\n   \\]\n   If the filter function \\(H(\\omega)\\) does not satisfy these conditions, the original signal cannot be uniquely recovered.\n\nSince the problem statement does not specify that \\(H(\\omega) = 1\\) for all \\(\\omega\\), we cannot unequivocally determine the original time-domain signal \\(z(t)\\) without additional information about \\(H(\\omega)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
