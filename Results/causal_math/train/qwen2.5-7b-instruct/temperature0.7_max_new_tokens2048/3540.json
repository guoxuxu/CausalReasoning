    "To address this question, let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The given PDE is \\(\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = -\\lambda u(x, y)\\). This is an eigenvalue problem for the Laplacian operator with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\(u(x, y)\\) gives us the frequency domain representation \\(\\mathcal{F}(u(x, y))\\). For the Laplacian operator, the Fourier transform has a specific property: \\(\\mathcal{F}(\\nabla^2 u(x, y)) = -|\\xi|^2 \\mathcal{F}(u(x, y))\\), where \\(\\xi\\) is the frequency variable.\n\n3. **Transformed Equation**: Substituting the Fourier transform into the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   -|\\xi|^2 \\mathcal{F}(u(x, y)) = -\\lambda \\mathcal{F}(u(x, y))\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   |\\xi|^2 = \\lambda\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for Frequency Components**: From the above equation, we can see that the frequency components of \\(u(x, y)\\) are directly determined by \\(\\lambda\\). Specifically, \\(|\\xi| = \\sqrt{\\lambda}\\).\n\n5. **Identifying \\(u(x, y)\\)**: Knowing \\(\\lambda\\) allows us to determine the frequency components of \\(u(x, y)\\). However, the inverse Fourier transform will give us the spatial domain function \\(u(x, y)\\), but without additional boundary conditions or constraints, there could be multiple functions that satisfy the same frequency components.\n\n6. **Intervention \\(h(x, y)\\)**: If \\(h(x, y)\\) is considered as some perturbation or external influence, its Fourier transform would also be determined by \\(\\lambda\\) if it were to follow the same PDE structure. However, without specific information about \\(h(x, y)\\), we cannot uniquely determine \\(h(x, y)\\) from \\(\\lambda\\) alone.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: While \\(\\lambda\\) provides crucial information about the frequency components of \\(u(x, y)\\), it does not uniquely determine either \\(u(x, y)\\) or \\(h(x, y)\\) without additional information.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
