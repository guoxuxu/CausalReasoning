The PDE given is \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + A \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0\\), which describes a linear advection equation. This equation suggests that the solution \\(u(x,t)\\) will propagate with a speed \\(A\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition \\(u(x,0) = u_0(x)\\) gives us \\(U(k,0) = \\mathcal{F}[u_0(x)]\\). Since the PDE is linear, the Fourier transform of the solution \\(u(x,t)\\) is \\(U(k,t) = e^{-iAk t} U(k,0)\\).\n\n3. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: The inverse Fourier transform of \\(U(k,t)\\) gives us back \\(u(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[e^{-iAk t} U(k,0)]\\). This represents the solution to the PDE without any additional intervention.\n\n4. **Intervention with Inverse Fourier Transform**: If we apply an inverse Fourier transform at some time \\(t_1\\), it essentially undoes the Fourier transform that was previously applied. The effect of this intervention would be to revert the solution back to its form in the spatial domain at time \\(t_1\\).\n\n5. **Final State Comparison**: To compare the final states, let's consider the evolution of the solution from \\(t=0\\) to \\(T\\). Without any Fourier transform intervention, the solution evolves as \\(u(x,T) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[e^{-iAk T} U(k,0)]\\). With the intervention, at \\(t_1\\), we revert to \\(u(x,t_1) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[U(k,t_1)]\\), and then let it evolve further to \\(T\\). The evolution from \\(t_1\\) to \\(T\\) is still governed by the same PDE, so \\(u(x,T)\\) after the intervention would be the same as if no Fourier transform were initially applied.\n\nGiven this analysis, the final state \\(u(x,T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will indeed be the same whether a Fourier transform was initially applied or not, because the intervention at \\(t_1\\) simply undoes the previous transformation and allows the solution to continue evolving according to the original PDE.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
