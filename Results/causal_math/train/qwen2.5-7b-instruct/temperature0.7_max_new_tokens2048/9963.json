    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). This represents a pure harmonic oscillation in the complex plane, which can be visualized as a point moving in a circle (or ellipse if \\(\\omega\\) is not purely real) with angular frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( h(z) = z^2 \\)**:\n   - Applying \\( h(z) \\) to \\( z(t) \\) gives \\( h(z(t)) = (e^{i\\omega t})^2 = e^{i2\\omega t} \\).\n   - This transformation squares the argument of the exponential function, effectively doubling the angular frequency from \\(\\omega\\) to \\(2\\omega\\).\n\n3. **Transformation \\( k(z) = z^3 \\)**:\n   - Applying \\( k(z) \\) to \\( z(t) \\) directly would give \\( k(z(t)) = (e^{i\\omega t})^3 = e^{i3\\omega t} \\).\n   - However, we apply \\( k(z) \\) to \\( h(z) \\), so we first have \\( h(z(t)) = e^{i2\\omega t} \\) and then \\( k(h(z(t))) = (e^{i2\\omega t})^3 = e^{i6\\omega t} \\).\n   - This transformation triples the argument of the exponential function after squaring it, resulting in a new angular frequency of \\(6\\omega\\).\n\n4. **Time Consideration**:\n   - We are given that \\( t_1 < T \\). The transformations \\( h(z) \\) and \\( k(z) \\) are applied at \\( t_1 \\), but we are interested in the state of the system at time \\( T \\).\n   - If \\( t_1 < T \\), the transformations have already occurred, and the system is in a state described by \\( e^{i6\\omega t} \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\).\n\n5. **Final State at Time \\( T \\)**:\n   - At time \\( T \\), if \\( T > t_1 \\), the system is governed by \\( e^{i6\\omega (T-t_1)} \\cdot e^{i6\\omega t_1} \\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\( e^{i6\\omega T} \\), indicating that the angular frequency is now \\( 6\\omega \\).\n\nGiven these steps, the waveform at time \\( T \\) reflects the influence of both transformations, specifically with an angular frequency of \\( 6\\omega \\), rather than just the original \\(\\omega\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
