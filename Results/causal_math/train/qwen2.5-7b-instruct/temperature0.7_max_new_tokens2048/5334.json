    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Equation**: The given partial differential equation (PDE) is the wave equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\nabla^2 u\n   \\]\n   This describes how a wave propagates through a medium with speed \\(c\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\(F(u)\\) of the function \\(u(t)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} u(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transformed Equation**: Applying the Fourier transform to the wave equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}\\right) = \\mathcal{F}(c^2 \\nabla^2 u)\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Fourier transform, specifically that the Fourier transform of the second derivative with respect to time is \\((-i\\omega)^2\\) and the Fourier transform of the Laplacian is \\((-\\nabla^2)\\):\n   \\[\n   (-i\\omega)^2 U(\\omega) = c^2 (-\\nabla^2) U(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   -\\omega^2 U(\\omega) = -c^2 k^2 U(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   Where \\(k\\) is the wave number corresponding to \\(\\nabla^2\\). Thus, the transformed equation is:\n   \\[\n   \\omega^2 U(\\omega) = c^2 k^2 U(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   Or:\n   \\[\n   U(\\omega) (\\omega^2 - c^2 k^2) = 0\n   \\]\n   Assuming \\(U(\\omega) \\neq 0\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\omega^2 = c^2 k^2\n   \\]\n   So:\n   \\[\n   \\omega = \\pm ck\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solution in Frequency Domain**: The solution in the frequency domain is thus:\n   \\[\n   U(\\omega) = A e^{i ck x} + B e^{-i ck x}\n   \\]\n   Where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\n5. **Reconstructing \\(u(t)\\)**: To reconstruct \\(u(t)\\), we need to take the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   u(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(U(\\omega)) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(A e^{i ck x} + B e^{-i ck x})\n   \\]\n   Using the inverse Fourier transform properties, we get:\n   \\[\n   u(t) = A \\delta(t - \\frac{x}{c}) + B \\delta(t + \\frac{x}{c})\n   \\]\n   Where \\(\\delta(t)\\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n6. **At \\(t = 0\\)**: Evaluating \\(u(t)\\) at \\(t = 0\\):\n   \\[\n   u(0) = A \\delta(0 - \\frac{x}{c}) + B \\delta(0 + \\frac{x}{c}) = A \\delta(-\\frac{x}{c}) + B \\delta(\\frac{x}{c})\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\delta(-x) = \\delta(x)\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   u(0) = A \\delta(\\frac{x}{c}) + B \\delta(\\frac{x}{c}) = (A + B) \\delta(\\frac{x}{c})\n   \\]\n\nGiven the above steps, we can conclude that the values of \\(u(t)\\) at \\(t = 0\\) can be exactly reconstructed from the solution in the frequency domain, provided the initial conditions are known.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the steps to reason through this problem:\n\n1. **Given PDE**: The given partial differential equation (PDE) is the wave equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\nabla^2 u\n   \\]\n   This describes how the function \\(u(t)\\) changes over time in a medium with speed of sound \\(c\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform \\(F(u)\\) to the wave equation involves transforming both sides of the equation into the frequency domain. The Fourier transform of the second time derivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}\\right] = -\\omega^2 \\tilde{u}(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   and the Fourier transform of the Laplacian term depends on the spatial dimensions but generally involves a similar form in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Transformed Equation**: In the frequency domain, the wave equation becomes an ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n   \\[\n   -\\omega^2 \\tilde{u}(\\omega) = c^2 \\mathcal{F}[\\nabla^2 u]\n   \\]\n   Solving this ODE for \\(\\tilde{u}(\\omega)\\) will give us the solution in the frequency domain.\n\n4. **Reconstructing \\(u(t)\\)**: To reconstruct \\(u(t)\\) from its Fourier transform \\(\\tilde{u}(\\omega)\\), we apply the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   u(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\tilde{u}(\\omega)] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i\\omega t} \\tilde{u}(\\omega) d\\omega\n   \\]\n\n5. **Exact Reconstruction**: The Fourier transform and its inverse are exact operations, meaning that if we have \\(\\tilde{u}(\\omega)\\) obtained correctly from the transformed equation, we can exactly reconstruct \\(u(t)\\) using the inverse Fourier transform.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that yes, we can exactly reconstruct the original function \\(u(t)\\) at any point, including \\(t = 0\\), from the solution in the frequency domain.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
