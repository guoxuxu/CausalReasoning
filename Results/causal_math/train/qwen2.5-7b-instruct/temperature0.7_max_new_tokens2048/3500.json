This is a first-order linear PDE known as the transport equation. It describes how a quantity \\(u(x,t)\\) changes over time and space with a constant speed \\(c\\).\n\n2. **Initial Condition and Transformation**: We are given the transformation \\( T(u) = \\int e^{-sx}u(x,0)dx \\) applied at \\(t=0\\). This means we are transforming the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\) into a new function \\(T(u)(s)\\) using this integral.\n\n3. **Effect of the Transformation**: The transformation \\(T(u)\\) at \\(t=0\\) converts the spatial distribution of \\(u(x,0)\\) into a frequency-like representation. Since the transport equation preserves the form of solutions, any solution \\(u(x,t)\\) can be expressed as a function that moves with velocity \\(c\\).\n\n4. **Reversing the Transformation**: To determine if we can definitively identify the transformations applied based on the state at \\(t=T\\), we need to consider if the transformation \\(T(u)\\) retains enough information about the original function \\(u(x,0)\\) to uniquely reconstruct it.\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Reconstruction**: Given that the transport equation is a linear first-order PDE and the transformation \\(T(u)\\) is a Fourier-like transform in the spatial domain, the information loss is minimal.

This transformation essentially weights the initial distribution of \\(u\\) by \\(e^{-sx}\\) and integrates over all space.\n\n3. **Effect of the Transformation**: At \\(t=0\\), the value of \\(T(u)(0)\\) is a single number that represents the weighted average of the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\) with a Gaussian weight function. This transformation does not preserve the spatial information of \\(u(x,0)\\); instead, it provides a summary statistic about the initial distribution.\n\n4. **Evolution of the System**: The solution to the advection equation can be found using the method of characteristics.

This transformation essentially integrates the function \\(u(x,0)\\) weighted by \\(e^{-sx}\\) over all \\(x\\).\n\n3. **Effect of Transformation at \\(t = T\\)**:\n   We need to determine if the state \\(T(u)(T)\\) alone can definitively determine whether the transformation \\(T(u)\\) was applied at \\(t = 0\\) and not \\(G(u)\\) or both. However, the problem does not specify any other transformation \\(G(u)\\), so we will focus on \\(T(u)\\).\n\n4. **Invertibility of the Transformation**:\n   To determine if \\(T(u)(T)\\) can uniquely identify the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\), we need to consider the invertibility of the transformation \\(T(u)\\). The inverse of \\(T(u)\\) would ideally allow us to recover \\(u(x,0)\\) from \\(T(u)(T)\\).\n\n5. **Recovery of Initial Condition**:\n   The transformation \\(T(u)\\) is a Fourier-like transform that shifts the variable \\(x\\) into the frequency domain through the weight \\(e^{-sx}\\). While this transformation provides a unique representation of \\(u(x,0)\\), it does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the original function \\(u(x,0)\\) without additional constraints or knowledge about the form of \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Given that \\(T(u)\\) is a continuous and bijective (one-to-one and onto) transformation for suitable values of \\(s\\), the transformed function \\(T(u)(T)\\) should theoretically contain all the necessary information to reconstruct \\(u(x,0)\\) up to a certain degree.
