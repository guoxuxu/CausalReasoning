    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a function \\( g(x) \\) represented as a Fourier series:\n   \\[\n   g(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} a_n e^{inx}\n   \\]\n   The transformation \\( T \\) modifies this series to:\n   \\[\n   T(g(x)) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Intervention with \\( T' \\)**: An additional transformation \\( T' \\) is applied:\n   \\[\n   T'(g(x)) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n b_n a_n e^{inx}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Understanding the Transforms**:\n   - \\( T \\) transforms \\( g(x) \\) using coefficients \\( b_n \\).\n   - \\( T' \\) further transforms the result of \\( T \\) using coefficients \\( c_n \\).\n\n4. **Spectral Properties**:\n   - The spectral properties of a function are determined by its Fourier coefficients.\n   - The first transformation \\( T \\) changes the Fourier coefficients from \\( a_n \\) to \\( b_n a_n \\).\n   - The second transformation \\( T' \\) changes these coefficients again to \\( c_n b_n a_n \\).\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), the function after applying \\( T \\) is \\( g'(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx} \\).\n   - At time \\( t_2 \\), after applying \\( T' \\), the function becomes \\( g''(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n b_n a_n e^{inx} \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The final spectral properties at \\( t_2 \\) are influenced by both \\( b_n \\) and \\( c_n \\). Specifically, the coefficients of the Fourier series at \\( t_2 \\) are \\( c_n b_n a_n \\), which means both sets of coefficients play a role in determining the spectral properties.\n\nTherefore, the final spectral properties at \\( t_2 \\) do depend on both \\( b_n \\) and \\( c_n \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a function \\( g(x) \\) represented as a Fourier series:\n   \\[\n   g(x) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} a_n e^{inx}\n   \\]\n\n2. **First Transformation**: A linear operator \\( T \\) modifies \\( g(x) \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   T(g(x)) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} b_n a_n e^{inx}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( b_n \\) are coefficients that modify the Fourier coefficients \\( a_n \\).\n\n3. **Intervention**: At a later time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( T' \\) is applied to \\( g(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   T'(g(x)) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n b_n a_n e^{inx}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( c_n \\) are new coefficients.\n\n4. **Final State**: The goal is to determine if the final spectral properties (i.e., the transformed Fourier series) at time \\( t_2 > t_1 \\) depend only on the initial coefficients \\( b_n \\) and not on \\( c_n \\).\n\n5. **Analyzing the Transformations**:\n   - The first transformation \\( T \\) changes the Fourier coefficients from \\( a_n \\) to \\( b_n a_n \\).\n   - The second transformation \\( T' \\) further modifies these coefficients by multiplying them with \\( c_n \\).\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The final state after both transformations is given by:\n     \\[\n     T'(T(g(x))) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} c_n b_n a_n e^{inx}\n     \\]\n   - Clearly, the final state depends on both \\( b_n \\) and \\( c_n \\). If either set of coefficients were absent, the final state would be different.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the final spectral properties involve both \\( b_n \\) and \\( c_n \\), they cannot depend solely on \\( b_n \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
