However, since \\( \\hat{U}_0(k) \\) is not canceled out, the solution remains dependent on the initial condition.\n\nTherefore, the solution \\( \\hat{U}(k, T) \\) at time \\( T > t_1 \\) is not independent of the initial function \\( U(x, 0) \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the solution \\(\\hat{U}(k, T)\\) at time \\(T > t_1\\) is independent of the initial function \\(U(x, 0)\\) after applying the intervention \\(G(k)\\) at some intermediate time \\(t_1\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply the Fourier Transform to the PDE**: \n   The given PDE is \\(U_{xx} = -\\lambda U\\). Applying the Fourier transform over space, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{U_{xx}\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{-\\lambda U\\}\n   \\]\n   Using properties of the Fourier transform, this becomes:\n   \\[\n   (ik)^2 \\hat{U}(k, t) = -\\lambda \\hat{U}(k, t)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we obtain:\n   \\[\n   -k^2 \\hat{U}(k, t) = -\\lambda \\hat{U}(k, t)\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}(k, t) = A(k) e^{-\\lambda t}\n   \\]\n   where \\(A(k)\\) is the Fourier transform of the initial condition \\(U(x, 0)\\).\n\n2. **Intervention with \\(G(k)\\)**:\n   At time \\(t_1\\), an intervention \\(G(k) = e^{-\\alpha k^2 t_1}\\) is applied. This means that the solution at \\(t_1\\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}(k, t_1) = A(k) e^{-\\lambda t_1} e^{-\\alpha k^2 t_1}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Behavior for \\(t > t_1\\)**:\n   For times \\(t > t_1\\), the evolution of \\(\\hat{U}(k, t)\\) continues as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}(k, t) = \\hat{U}(k, t_1) e^{-(\\lambda - \\alpha k^2)(t - t_1)}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(\\hat{U}(k, t_1)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}(k, t) = A(k) e^{-\\lambda t_1} e^{-\\alpha k^2 t_1} e^{-(\\lambda - \\alpha k^2)(t - t_1)}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}(k, t) = A(k) e^{-\\lambda t_1} e^{-\\alpha k^2 t_1} e^{-\\lambda (t - t_1)} e^{\\alpha k^2 (t - t_1)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}(k, t) = A(k) e^{-\\lambda t_1} e^{-\\lambda (t - t_1)} e^{-\\alpha k^2 t_1 + \\alpha k^2 (t - t_1)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}(k, t) = A(k) e^{-\\lambda t} e^{-\\alpha k^2 t_1 (1 - e^{-(t - t_1)})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Independence from Initial Condition**:\n   The term \\(A(k)\\) is the Fourier transform of the initial condition \\(U(x, 0)\\). However, the factor \\(e^{-\\alpha k^2 t_1 (1 - e^{-(t - t_1)})}\\) depends on the initial condition through \\(A(k)\\). Thus, the solution \\(\\hat{U}(k, T)\\) at any time \\(T > t_1\\) still retains information about the initial condition \\(U(x, 0)\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution \\(\\hat{U}(k, T)\\) at time \\(T > t_1\\) is not independent of the initial function \\(U(x, 0)\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Equation**: The given PDE is \\( U_{xx} = -\\lambda U \\). This is a simple second-order linear homogeneous PDE with constant coefficients.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform over space \\(x\\) results in the transformed function \\( \\hat{U}(k, t) \\). The Fourier transform of \\( U_{xx} \\) with respect to \\(x\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   (-k^2 \\hat{U}(k, t)) = -\\lambda \\hat{U}(k, t)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}_{tt}(k, t) + (\\lambda + k^2)\\hat{U}(k, t) = 0\n   \\]\n   This is a simple harmonic oscillator equation for each mode \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Intervention \\(G(k)\\)**: At some intermediate time \\(t_1\\), the function \\(G(k) = e^{-\\alpha k^2 t_1}\\) is applied. This can be seen as an external forcing or modification of the solution at that specific time.\n\n4. **Behavior Post-Intervention**: We need to determine if the solution \\( \\hat{U}(k, T) \\) at time \\(T > t_1\\) is independent of the initial function \\( U(x, 0) \\).\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - Before \\(t_1\\), the solution \\( \\hat{U}(k, t) \\) evolves according to the homogeneous equation driven by the initial condition \\( U(x, 0) \\).\n   - At \\(t = t_1\\), the intervention \\(G(k)\\) modifies the solution. The new solution after this intervention will depend on both the previous state and the intervention.\n   - For \\(t > t_1\\), the solution continues to evolve according to the same PDE but now starting from the modified state due to the intervention.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the intervention \\(G(k)\\) changes the state of the system at \\(t_1\\), the subsequent evolution (for \\(t > t_1\\)) will be influenced by this change. Therefore, the solution \\( \\hat{U}(k, T) \\) at any future time \\(T > t_1\\) will not be independent of the initial function \\( U(x, 0) \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
