    "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Differential Equation**:\n   - We have a complex-valued function \\( z(t) \\) that satisfies the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = iCz \\), where \\( C \\) is a real constant.\n   - This is a first-order linear differential equation. The solution to this equation can be found using standard methods for solving such equations.\n\n2. **Solving the Differential Equation**:\n   - The general solution to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = iCz \\) is \\( z(t) = z(0)e^{iCt} \\). Here, \\( z(0) \\) is the initial condition of the function \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Integral Transformation**:\n   - The integral transformation is given by \\( f(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-iCs} z(s) ds \\).\n   - Substituting the solution \\( z(s) = z(0)e^{iCs} \\) into the integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     f(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-iCs} z(0)e^{iCs} ds = z(0) \\int_{0}^{t} ds = z(0)t.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( f(z) = z(0)t \\).\n\n4. **Determining the Initial Condition from \\( f(z) \\)**:\n   - If we know \\( f(z) \\) and \\( t \\), we can solve for \\( z(0) \\):\n     \\[\n     f(z) = z(0)t \\implies z(0) = \\frac{f(z)}{t}.\n     \\]\n   - Given \\( f(z) \\) and \\( t \\), we can uniquely determine \\( z(0) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we can determine \\( z(0) \\) from \\( f(z) \\) and \\( t \\), we can trace back to determine whether the integral transformation \\( f(z) \\) was initially applied.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
