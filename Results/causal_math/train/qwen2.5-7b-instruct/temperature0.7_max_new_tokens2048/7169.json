  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation \\\\(g(z) = z^2\\\\) initially squares the value at \\\\(t = 0\\\\).

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: At \\( t = 0 \\), we have \\( z(0) = e^{i \\cdot 0} = 1 \\).

After this transformation, the state remains \\( z = 1 \\).\n\n3. **Subsequent Evolution**: After applying the transformation, \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) evolves the state over time.
