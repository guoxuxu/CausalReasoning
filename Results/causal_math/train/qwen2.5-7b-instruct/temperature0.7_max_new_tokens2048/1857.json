This transformation scales the complex number \\( z \\) by \\( e^{Ct} \\).\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: At \\( t = 0 \\), we apply \\( f(z) \\) to \\( z_0 \\). This means:\n   \\[\n   z(0) = z_0 \\rightarrow f(z_0) = e^{C \\cdot 0}z_0 = z_0\n   \\]\n   So initially, there is no change due to the transformation.\n\n4. **Evolution Under Differential Equations**: Without further intervention, \\( z(t) \\) evolves under the differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\).

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**:\n   - The initial complex function is \\( z(0) = x(0) + iy(0) \\).\n   - The transformation is given by \\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Transformation**:\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), we have \\( z(0) = x(0) + iy(0) \\).\n   - Applying the transformation at \\( t = 0 \\), we get \\( f(z(0)) = e^{C \\cdot 0}z(0) = z(0) = x(0) + iy(0) \\).\n\n3. **Evolution Under Differential Equations**:\n   - Without further intervention, the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the differential equations \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\).\n   - This means that \\( x(t) = x(0)e^{At} \\) and \\( y(t) = y(0)e^{Bt} \\).\n\n4. **Transformation Evolution**:\n   - Now, applying the transformation to the evolved state \\( z(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     f(z(t)) = e^{Ct}z(t) = e^{Ct}(x(t) + iy(t)) = e^{Ct}(x(0)e^{At} + iy(0)e^{Bt})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     f(z(t)) = (x(0)e^{(A+C)t} + iy(0)e^{(B+C)t})\n     \\]\n\n5. **Direct Evolution**:\n   - If we evolve \\( z_0 = x(0) + iy(0) \\) directly under the differential equations, we would have:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = x(0)e^{AT} + iy(0)e^{BT}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Comparison**:\n   - For the states to be identical at time \\( T \\), we need:\n     \\[\n     (x(0)e^{(A+C)T} + iy(0)e^{(B+C)T}) = (x(0)e^{AT} + iy(0)e^{BT})\n     \\]\n   - This implies that \\( (A+C)T = AT \\) and \\( (B+C)T = BT \\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\( CT = 0 \\).
