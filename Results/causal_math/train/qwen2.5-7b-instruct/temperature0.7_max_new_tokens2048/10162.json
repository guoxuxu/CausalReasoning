    "To determine if the initial state \\( z(0) \\) can be uniquely determined from the given observations \\( z(T) \\), we need to analyze the system of differential equations and their implications.\n\n1. **Differential Equations Analysis**:\n   - The given system of differential equations is:\n     \\[\n     \\dot{x} = -y + p(t)x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\dot{y} = x + p(t)y\n     \\]\n   - These equations describe how \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) evolve over time based on the function \\( p(t) \\).\n\n2. **Behavior Under the Differential Operator**:\n   - Applying the differential operator \\( \\frac{d}{dt} \\) to \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     \\dot{z} = \\dot{x} + i\\dot{y}\n     \\]\n     Substituting the given differential equations:\n     \\[\n     \\dot{z} = (-y + p(t)x) + i(x + p(t)y)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     \\dot{z} = (p(t)x + ix) + (i p(t)y - y) = (p(t) + i)x + (i p(t) - 1)y\n     \\]\n\n3. **Initial and Final States**:\n   - We observe \\( z(T) \\), but we need to determine \\( z(0) \\).\n   - The system of differential equations is linear and time-dependent due to \\( p(t) \\). Without specific forms of \\( p(t) \\) or initial conditions, the solution to these equations generally depends on the entire history of \\( p(t) \\) from \\( t=0 \\) to \\( t=T \\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Initial State**:\n   - For the initial state \\( z(0) \\) to be uniquely determined from \\( z(T) \\), the system must be such that the solution at \\( t=T \\) uniquely maps back to the initial condition.\n   - However, since \\( p(t) \\) is a known function of time, the system is not guaranteed to be invertible for arbitrary \\( p(t) \\). The solution to the system of differential equations is generally non-unique unless additional constraints or boundary conditions are provided.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given only the final state \\( z(T) \\) and no additional information about the intermediate states or the form of \\( p(t) \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( z(0) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
