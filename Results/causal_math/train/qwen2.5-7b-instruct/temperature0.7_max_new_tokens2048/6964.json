    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Signal**: The given signal \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a simple sinusoidal wave with a constant frequency \\( \\omega \\). Its Fourier Transform \\( F(s) \\) should ideally be a Dirac delta function at \\( s = \\omega \\) if no windowing is applied.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Without Windowing**: If there were no window function applied, the Fourier Transform would be:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-2\\pi i s t} dt = \\delta(s - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   This indicates that all the energy is concentrated at \\( s = \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Window Function**: A window function \\( w(t) \\) modifies the original signal before taking the Fourier Transform.

The exact form of \\( w(t) \\) cannot be directly inferred from \\( F(s) \\) because different window functions can produce similar-looking spectra depending on their properties (like bandwidth and main lobe width).\n\n5. **Unambiguous Determination**: To unambiguously determine the window function \\( w(t) \\) from \\( F(s) \\), we would need additional information about the original signal or the specific characteristics of the window function. For example, if we know the original signal was a pure sine wave, we could infer that no windowing occurred if \\( F(s) \\) shows a sharp peak at \\( \\omega \\).
