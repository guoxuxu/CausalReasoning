    "To determine if the temperature at time \\(T\\) will be the same with the heating function applied compared to no heating, we need to solve the differential equation with and without the heating function.\n\n### Without Heating Function:\nThe differential equation is:\n\\[ \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\Delta T \\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. The general solution to this equation is:\n\\[ \\Delta T(t) = A e^{-kt} \\]\nwhere \\(A\\) is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n### With Heating Function:\nThe differential equation now becomes:\n\\[ \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\Delta T + h(t) = -k\\Delta T + H e^{-kt} \\]\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous first-order linear differential equation. To solve it, we can use the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor is \\(e^{kt}\\). Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor gives:\n\\[ e^{kt} \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} + k e^{kt} \\Delta T = H \\]\n\nThe left side is the derivative of \\(e^{kt} \\Delta T\\):\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt} (e^{kt} \\Delta T) = H \\]\n\nIntegrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n\\[ e^{kt} \\Delta T = H \\int e^{-kt} dt = -\\frac{H}{k} e^{-kt} + C \\]\n\\[ \\Delta T(t) = -\\frac{H}{k} + C e^{-kt} \\]\n\nUsing the initial condition \\(\\Delta T(0) = 0\\):\n\\[ 0 = -\\frac{H}{k} + C \\Rightarrow C = \\frac{H}{k} \\]\n\nSo the solution is:\n\\[ \\Delta T(t) = \\frac{H}{k} (1 - e^{-kt}) \\]\n\n### Comparing the Two Solutions:\n- **Without Heating**: \\(\\Delta T(t) = A e^{-kt}\\)\n- **With Heating**: \\(\\Delta T(t) = \\frac{H}{k} (1 - e^{-kt})\\)\n\nAt time \\(T\\):\n- Without Heating: \\(\\Delta T(T) = A e^{-kT}\\)\n- With Heating: \\(\\Delta T(T) = \\frac{H}{k} (1 - e^{-kT})\\)\n\nThese two expressions are clearly different for any \\(T > 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the temperature at time \\(T\\) will not be the same if the heating function is applied compared to no heating.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
