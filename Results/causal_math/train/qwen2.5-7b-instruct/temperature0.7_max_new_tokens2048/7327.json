This means that the state \\( x(t) \\) is transformed to \\( y(t) = Dx(t) \\).\n   - The SDE for \\( y(t) \\) becomes:\n     \\[\n     dy(t) = D(Cx(t))dt + DdW(t) = CDx(t)dt + DdW(t)\n     \\]\n     This shows that the transformation \\( D \\) modifies both the deterministic and stochastic parts of the system.\n\n3. **Intervention with Transformation \\( m(x) \\)**:\n   - At time \\( t_2 \\), a new transformation \\( m(x) = Ex \\) is applied.
