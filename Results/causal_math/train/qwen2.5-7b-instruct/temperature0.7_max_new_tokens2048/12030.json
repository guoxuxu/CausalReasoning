This is a fundamental property of the Fourier Transform known as the frequency shift theorem.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The Fourier Transform of the modified function will indeed be centered at \\(\\omega + \\Delta\\omega\\), regardless of the original \\(\\omega\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of Initial Function**: The Fourier Transform of \\(z(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega' t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega' t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - \\omega') t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral results in a Dirac delta function:\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega') = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\n   \\]\n   This means the Fourier Transform is centered at \\(\\omega\\).\n\n3. **Modified Function**: Now, let's modify the frequency to \\(\\omega + \\Delta\\omega\\) at time \\(t_1\\). The modified function becomes:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = e^{i(\\omega + \\Delta\\omega) t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of Modified Function**: The Fourier Transform of the modified function is:\n   \\[\n   F'(\\omega'') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z'(t) e^{-i\\omega'' t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega + \\Delta\\omega) t} e^{-i\\omega'' t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega + \\Delta\\omega - \\omega'') t} dt\n   \\]\n   This also results in a Dirac delta function:\n   \\[\n   F'(\\omega'') = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega + \\Delta\\omega - \\omega'')\n   \\]\n   This means the Fourier Transform is centered at \\(\\omega + \\Delta\\omega\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The Fourier Transform of the modified function \\(z'(t) = e^{i(\\omega + \\Delta\\omega) t}\\) is indeed centered at \\(\\omega + \\Delta\\omega\\), regardless of the original value of \\(\\omega\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
