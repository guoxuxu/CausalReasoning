This is a first-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation in \\(z(t)\\).\n\n2. **Homogeneous Solution**:\n   First, consider the homogeneous part of the equation: \\(\\dot{z}_h = -i\\omega z_h\\). The solution to this equation is \\(z_h(t) = C e^{-i\\omega t}\\), where \\(C\\) is a constant.\n\n3. **Particular Solution**:\n   For the non-homogeneous part, we need to find a particular solution \\(z_p(t)\\) to the equation \\(\\dot{z}_p = -i\\omega z_p + F(t)\\). Assuming \\(z_p(t)\\) is of the form \\(A(t) + iB(t)\\) (where \\(A(t)\\) and \\(B(t)\\) are real functions), and knowing that the right side \\(F(t)\\) is real, we can use methods like variation of parameters or undetermined coefficients to find \\(z_p(t)\\).\n\n4. **General Solution**:\n   The general solution to the differential equation is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions: \\(z(t) = z_h(t) + z_p(t) = C e^{-i\\omega t} + z_p(t)\\).\n\n5. **Determine \\(F(t)\\)**:\n   To uniquely determine \\(F(t)\\), we need to isolate it in the equation \\(\\dot{z} = -i\\omega z + F(t)\\). Rearranging gives \\(F(t) = \\dot{z}(t) + i\\omega z(t)\\). Given \\(z(t)\\), we can compute \\(\\dot{z}(t)\\) and substitute back to find \\(F(t)\\).\n\n6. **Uniqueness**:\n   The key point here is whether the information about \\(z(t)\\) is sufficient to uniquely determine \\(F(t)\\). Since \\(F(t)\\) appears explicitly in the equation and there are no additional constraints or hidden variables, in principle, knowing \\(z(t)\\) should allow us to determine \\(F(t)\\) uniquely.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the answer is that we can indeed uniquely determine the force function \\(F(t)\\) from the particle's motion trajectory \\(z(t)\\) under the given conditions.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Solving for \\(z(t)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{-i\\omega t} \\left( \\int e^{i\\omega t} F(t) dt + C \\right)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine \\(F(t)\\)**: To find \\(F(t)\\) uniquely, we need to know the initial condition \\(z(0)\\) and the entire trajectory \\(z(t)\\) over the interval \\([0, T]\\). Given these, we can determine the integral term and thus \\(F(t)\\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness**: If we have the exact trajectory \\(z(t)\\) for all \\(t \\in [0, T]\\), and knowing \\(z(0)\\), we can solve the integral equation for \\(F(t)\\).
