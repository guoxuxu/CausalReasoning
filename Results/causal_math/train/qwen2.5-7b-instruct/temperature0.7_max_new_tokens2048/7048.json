But this does not directly tell us the individual matrices \\( M \\) and \\( N \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the effect of combining both transformations results in a single matrix \\( e^{(M+N)T} \\), and we cannot uniquely decompose \\( e^{(M+N)T} \\) into \\( e^{MT} \\) and \\( e^{NT} \\) without more information, we cannot accurately determine which transformations were applied.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
