    "To determine if the system's trajectory will be the same after applying the Laplace transform to the initial conditions and evolving them according to the given differential equations, we need to analyze the effect of the Laplace transform on the system.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions Transformation**: The Laplace transform of \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) is applied. Let's denote the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) as \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\) respectively. The Laplace transform of the initial conditions \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) can be denoted as \\( X(0) \\) and \\( Y(0) \\).\n\n2. **Differential Equations in S-Domain**: Applying the Laplace transform to the differential equations:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right) = sX(s) - x(0) = aX(s) - bY(s)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right) = sY(s) - y(0) = bX(s) + aY(s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solving for \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\)**: We have a system of linear equations:\n   \\[\n   sX(s) - x(0) = aX(s) - bY(s)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   sY(s) - y(0) = bX(s) + aY(s)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying these, we get:\n   \\[\n   (s-a)X(s) + bY(s) = x(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -bX(s) + (s-a)Y(s) = y(0)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Matrix Formulation**: This can be written in matrix form as:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n   s-a & b \\\\\n   -b & s-a\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n   X(s) \\\\\n   Y(s)\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   =\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n   x(0) \\\\\n   y(0)\n   \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: Once \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\) are found, their inverse Laplace transforms give \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\). The key point here is that the transformation back to the time domain should theoretically recover the original functions \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) if the initial conditions are correctly transformed and the system evolves according to the same differential equations.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the differential equations governing the system are linear and the Laplace transform is a linear operation, the solution in the time domain after transforming the initial conditions and solving the transformed equations should match the solution obtained by directly applying the differential equations to the original initial conditions.\n\nTherefore, the system's trajectory will be the same whether the Laplace transform is applied to the initial conditions or not, as long as the transform is correctly inverted and the system evolves according to the same differential equations.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine whether the system's trajectory will be the same after applying the Laplace transform to the initial conditions \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) and evolving them according to the differential equations, let's reason through this step-by-step.\n\n1. **Original System Dynamics**:\n   The original system is described by the differential equations:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - by\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dy}{dt} = bx + ay\n   \\]\n   These are linear first-order differential equations with constant coefficients.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Application**:\n   Applying the Laplace transform to the initial conditions \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) gives us the transformed initial conditions in the s-domain:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n   The Laplace transforms of the differential equations yield:\n   \\[\n   sX(s) - x(0) = aX(s) - bY(s)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   sY(s) - y(0) = bX(s) + aY(s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solving for Transformed Variables**:\n   Rearranging these transformed equations to solve for \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   (s - a)X(s) + bY(s) = x(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -bX(s) + (s - a)Y(s) = y(0)\n   \\]\n   This is a system of linear equations that can be solved using matrix methods or substitution.\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   Once we have \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\), we apply the inverse Laplace transform to obtain \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\). The inverse Laplace transform is a one-to-one operation, meaning each unique set of initial conditions \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) corresponds to a unique solution in the time domain.\n\n5. **Trajectory Comparison**:\n   The key point here is that the Laplace transform is a linear operation, and it preserves the linearity of the differential equations. Therefore, the solutions obtained from the transformed equations will be equivalent to the solutions of the original differential equations when the inverse Laplace transform is applied. This means that the trajectory of the system in the time domain remains unchanged regardless of whether the Laplace transform is applied to the initial conditions.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the system's trajectory will indeed be the same if the Laplace transform is applied to the initial conditions and then evolved according to the differential equations.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the system's trajectory remains the same after applying the Laplace transform to the initial conditions \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the System Dynamics**: The system is described by two coupled first-order linear differential equations:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - by\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dy}{dt} = bx + ay\n   \\]\n\n2. **Initial Conditions and Transform**: The initial conditions are \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\). Applying the Laplace transform to these initial conditions gives us \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\), where:\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transformed Differential Equations**: When we apply the Laplace transform to the differential equations, assuming zero initial conditions for simplicity (since we only care about the effect of the initial conditions), we get:\n   \\[\n   sX(s) - x(0) = ax(s) - by(s)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   sY(s) - y(0) = bx(s) + ay(s)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\)**: Rearranging the transformed equations:\n   \\[\n   (s - a)X(s) - by(s) = x(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   bx(s) + (s - a)Y(s) = y(0)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Influence of Initial Conditions**: The solutions for \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\) depend on the initial conditions \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\). However, the differential equations themselves remain unchanged by the Laplace transform when considering the evolution of the system.\n\n6. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: When we take the inverse Laplace transform of \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\), we should obtain functions \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) that satisfy the original differential equations, provided the initial conditions are correctly transformed.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The key point here is that the differential equations governing the system remain the same regardless of whether the initial conditions are transformed using the Laplace transform or not. The solution to these differential equations, with appropriately transformed initial conditions, will evolve in the same manner as if no transform was applied.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the system's trajectory will indeed be the same if the initial conditions are correctly transformed using the Laplace transform and then evolved according to the differential equations.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
