We need to see how this affects the integral transformation \\( z(w) \\):\n   \\[\n   z_L(w) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{iwx} f(ax + b) \\, dx\n   \\]\n   By making a change of variables \\( u = ax + b \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   z_L(w) = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_b^\\infty e^{i\\left(\\frac{w}{a}\\right)(u - b)} f(u) \\, du\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   z_L(w) = \\frac{1}{a} e^{-iwb/a} \\int_b^\\infty e^{i\\left(\\frac{w}{a}\\right)u} f(u) \\, du\n   \\]\n   This shows that the transformation by \\( L \\) modifies \\( z(w) \\) by scaling the frequency domain variable and shifting the phase.\n\n3. **Causality and Intervention:**\n   Causality in signal processing generally refers to whether the output at any time depends only on past and present inputs.
