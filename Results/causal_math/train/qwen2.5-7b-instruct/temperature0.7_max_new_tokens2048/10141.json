This transformation converts the time-domain signal \\( x(t) \\) into its frequency-domain representation \\( X(s) \\).\n\n2. **Filtering in Frequency Domain**:\n   - Applying the transfer function \\( H(s) \\) to \\( X(s) \\) in the frequency domain results in \\( filtered\\_X(s) \\). Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n     \\[\n     filtered\\_X(s) = H(s) \\cdot X(s)\n     \\]\n   - This step involves multiplying the frequency response of the filter \\( H(s) \\) with the Fourier transform of the input signal \\( X(s) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:\n   - To convert \\( filtered\\_X(s) \\) back to the time domain, we apply the inverse Fourier transform:\n     \\[\n     filtered\\_x(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{filtered\\_X(s)\\}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Direct Filtering in Time Domain**:\n   - Directly applying a time-domain filter to \\( x(t) \\) would involve convolving \\( x(t) \\) with the impulse response of the filter \\( h(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     filtered\\_x(t) = x(t) * h(t)\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( h(t) \\) is the impulse response of the filter corresponding to the transfer function \\( H(s) \\).\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - According to the convolution theorem, the Fourier transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their Fourier transforms. Therefore, the inverse Fourier transform of \\( H(s) \\cdot X(s) \\) (filtering in the frequency domain) should be equivalent to the convolution of \\( x(t) \\) with \\( h(t) \\) (filtering in the time domain).\n   - Mathematically:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{H(s) \\cdot X(s)\\} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\} * \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{X(s)\\} = h(t) * x(t)\n     \\]\n\nGiven these steps, the filtering in the frequency domain (applying \\( H(s) \\) to \\( X(s) \\) and then taking the inverse Fourier transform) produces the same result as directly filtering \\( x(t) \\) with its corresponding time-domain filter \\( h(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
