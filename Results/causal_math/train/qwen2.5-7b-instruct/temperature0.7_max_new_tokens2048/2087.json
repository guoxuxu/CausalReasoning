The solution to this equation can be found using standard techniques such as separation of variables or numerical methods, but we don't need to solve it explicitly here. We need to understand how transformations affect the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the Transformation \\( f(z) = Cz \\)\nApplying the transformation \\( f(z) = Cz \\) means that the state \\( z(t) \\) is transformed into \\( Cz(t) \\). If we substitute \\( z(t) = C^{-1} w(t) \\) into the original differential equation, we get a new differential equation for \\( w(t) \\):\n\\[ \\frac{dw}{dt} = i\\omega C^{-1} w + k(C^{-1} w)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{dw}{dt} = i\\omega C^{-1} w + kC^{-1} w^2 C^{-1} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{dw}{dt} = i\\omega C^{-1} w + kC^{-1} w^2 C^{-1} \\]\n\nThis shows that the transformation by \\( C \\) does not simply scale the solution but also affects its form due to the nonlinear term \\( w^2 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Intervention with Transformation \\( g(z) = Dz \\)\nAt a specific time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( g(z) = Dz \\) is applied. This means that the state at \\( t_1 \\) is transformed from \\( z(t_1) \\) to \\( Dz(t_1) \\). Let's denote the state just after the intervention as \\( z'(t_1) = Dz(t_1) \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the State After the Intervention\nAfter the intervention, the new state \\( z'(t_1) \\) will evolve according to the original differential equation starting from \\( t_1 \\). The evolution of \\( z'(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) will be:\n\\[ \\frac{dz'}{dt} = i\\omega z' + kz'^2 \\]\nwith the initial condition \\( z'(t_1) = Dz(t_1) \\).\n\n### Step 5: Independence from Initial Transformation by \\( C \\)\nTo determine if the final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is independent of the initial transformation by \\( C \\), we need to consider the effect of the transformation \\( C \\) on the initial condition before the intervention. Since the transformation \\( C \\) affects both the linear and nonlinear terms in the differential equation, the solution will depend on \\( C \\).\n\nHowever, once the intervention with \\( g(z) = Dz \\) occurs, the state \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation starting from \\( z'(t_1) = Dz(t_1) \\).

This means the state at \\(t_1\\) is transformed to \\(z(t_1)D\\).\n\n5. **Behavior After \\(g(z) = Dz\\)**: After the transformation at \\(t_1\\), the system continues to evolve according to the original differential equation, but starting from \\(z(t_1)D\\). The new state at time \\(T > t_1\\) would be:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = D e^{i\\omega (T-t_1) + k(T-t_1)^2/2} z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   where \\(z(t_1)\\) is the state after the transformation by \\(C\\).\n\n6. **Independence of Initial Transformation \\(C\\)**: The final state \\(z(T)\\) depends on both the initial transformation \\(C\\) and the subsequent transformation \\(D\\). Specifically, \\(z(T)\\) includes the factor \\(C e^{i\\omega t_1 + kt_1^2/2} z_{initial}\\) from the initial condition and the factor \\(D e^{i\\omega (T-t_1) + k(T-t_1)^2/2}\\) from the evolution after the transformation by \\(D\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since \\(z(T)\\) includes terms from both \\(C\\) and \\(D\\), the state at time \\(T\\) is not independent of the initial transformation by \\(C\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
