  "Problem": "Evaluate the behavior of a complex function z(t) defined as z(t) = e^{At}w, where A is a complex constant matrix, and w is a complex vector. The function represents the evolution of z over time under the influence of matrix A, and we are interested in how various transformations, represented by another complex matrix B, affect this evolution.\n\nIf at t = 0 the function f(z) = Bz is applied to the vector w, and the system is then allowed to evolve under e^{At} without further intervention, will z(t) at t = T adhere strictly to the path defined by e^{At}Bw?",
  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Applying the transformation f(z) = Bz initially and then allowing the system to evolve under e^{At} results in z(t) = e^{At}Bw at any later time T. This outcome directly follows the sequence of transformations without deviation, as the initial transformation by B and the continuous evolution under A define a unique trajectory for z.",

  "causal_map_integration": "The application of transformation B to w results in Bw, which then evolves over time according to e^{At} to produce z(T). The matrix A governs the evolution, and e^{At} transforms Bw into z(t) at any given time t.",
