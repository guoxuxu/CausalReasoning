    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition and Fourier Transform**: \n   - The initial condition is \\( u(x, 0) \\).\n   - Applying the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) to \\( u(x, 0) \\) gives us \\( \\hat{u}(k, 0) \\), which is the frequency domain representation of the initial condition.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Properties**:\n   - The Fourier transform of the PDE \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + a \\cdot \\nabla u = 0 \\) can be transformed into the frequency domain using properties of Fourier transforms.\n   - Specifically, the time derivative \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\) becomes \\( i k \\cdot \\hat{u} \\) (where \\( k \\) is the wave number vector in the frequency domain).\n   - The spatial derivative \\( a \\cdot \\nabla u \\) becomes \\( -i a \\cdot k \\hat{u} \\).\n\n3. **Transformed PDE**:\n   - In the frequency domain, the PDE transforms to: \\( i k \\cdot \\hat{u}(k, t) - i a \\cdot k \\hat{u}(k, t) = 0 \\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\( \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = 0 \\).
