The transformed function \\( z(w') \\) is not simply a scaled version of \\( Z(s) \\) by a factor dependent only on \\( n \\). Instead, it involves the \\( n \\)-th derivative of \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the statement that \\( z(w') \\) will be the same as \\( z(w) \\) scaled by a factor of \\( n! \\) is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Transform**:\n   - The original function is \\( w(t) \\).\n   - Its Laplace transform is given by \\( z(w) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} w(t) dt \\).\n\n2. **Modification of w(t)**:\n   - The function \\( w(t) \\) is modified to form a new function \\( w'(t) = t^n w(t) \\), where \\( n \\) is a positive integer.\n   \n3. **Transforming the Modified Function**:\n   - We need to find the Laplace transform of \\( w'(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     z(w') = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} w'(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} (t^n w(t)) dt\n     \\]\n   - Using the property of integration by parts, we can express the integral involving \\( t^n \\) as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} t^n w(t) dt = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} w(t) dt \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Recognizing that \\( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} w(t) dt = z(w) \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     z(w') = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} z(w)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Comparing with the Given Statement**:\n   - The statement claims that \\( z(w') = z(w) \\times n! \\).\n   - For this to be true, the derivative term must simplify to \\( n! \\).\n\n5. **Derivative of \\( z(w) \\)**:\n   - Let's consider the first few derivatives to see if there's a pattern:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d}{ds} z(w) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} w(t) dt = -\\int_{0}^{\\infty} t e^{-st} w(t) dt\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d^2}{ds^2} z(w) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( -\\int_{0}^{\\infty} t e^{-st} w(t) dt \\right) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^2 e^{-st} w(t) dt\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d^3}{ds^3} z(w) = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^2 e^{-st} w(t) dt \\right) = -\\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^3 e^{-st} w(t) dt\n     \\]\n   - Continuing this process, we observe that:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} z(w) = (-1)^n \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-st} w(t) dt = (-1)^n z(w')\n     \\]\n   - This implies:\n     \\[\n     z(w') = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} z(w) = (-1)^n \\cdot n! \\cdot \\frac{z(w)}{n!}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     z(w') = z(w) \\cdot n!\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the statement is correct.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\( w(t) \\).\n\n2. **Transformation with Polynomial Scaling**:\n   - The new function is \\( w'(t) = t^n w(t) \\).\n   \n3. **Laplace Transform of the Original Function**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( w(t) \\) is given by \\( Z[w(t)] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} w(t) dt \\).\n\n4. **Laplace Transform of the Transformed Function**:\n   - We need to find the Laplace transform of \\( w'(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     Z[w'(t)] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} w'(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} (t^n w(t)) dt.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Integration by Parts**:\n   - To solve the integral, we can use integration by parts repeatedly. Let's denote the Laplace transform of \\( w(t) \\) as \\( Z[w(t)] = F(s) \\).\n   - The first integration by parts gives:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} t^n w(t) dt = \\left[ -\\frac{t^n}{s} e^{-st} w(t) \\right]_0^\\infty + \\frac{n}{s} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} t^{n-1} w(t) dt.\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( w(t) \\) is assumed to go to zero faster than \\( t \\) grows as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), the boundary term vanishes, and we get:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} t^n w(t) dt = \\frac{n}{s} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} t^{n-1} w(t) dt.\n     \\]\n   - Repeating this process \\( n \\) times, we obtain:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} t^n w(t) dt = \\frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} w(t) dt = \\frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} Z[w(t)].\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, the Laplace transform of \\( w'(t) = t^n w(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     Z[w'(t)] = \\frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} Z[w(t)].\n     \\]\n   - This shows that \\( Z[w'] \\) is indeed \\( Z[w] \\) scaled by a factor of \\( \\frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \\), not just \\( n! \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the correct scaling factor is \\( \\frac{n!}{s^{n+1}} \\), which depends on both \\( n \\) and \\( s \\). Therefore, the statement that \\( z(w') \\) is the same as \\( z(w) \\) scaled by \\( n! \\) is incorrect.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
