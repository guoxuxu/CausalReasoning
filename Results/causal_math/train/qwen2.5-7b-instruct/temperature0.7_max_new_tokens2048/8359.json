However, the core dependency remains on the properties of \\(L\\). The Laplace transform acts as a change of variables in the time domain, but it does not fundamentally alter the underlying dynamics governed by \\(L\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Despite the application of both Fourier and Laplace transforms, the essential behavior and solution of the system are fundamentally determined by the operator \\(L\\). The transformations are tools for solving the PDE in different domains but do not introduce additional dependencies beyond those inherent in \\(L\\).\n\nTherefore, the final representation \\(\\tilde{u}(s,T)\\) will indeed depend only on \\(L\\) and not on the specific initial Fourier transform or the subsequent Laplace transform.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
