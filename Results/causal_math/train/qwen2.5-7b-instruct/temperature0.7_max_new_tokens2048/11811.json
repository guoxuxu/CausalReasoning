    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what \\( T[z](t) \\) represents:\n   - Given \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), we substitute this into the integral transformation \\( T \\).\n   - So, \\( T[z](t) = \\int_0^t e^s e^{is} ds \\).\n\n2. Simplify the integrand:\n   - Combine the exponentials: \\( e^s e^{is} = e^{s+is} = e^{(1+i)s} \\).\n\n3. Evaluate the integral:\n   - The integral becomes \\( \\int_0^t e^{(1+i)s} ds \\).\n   - To solve this, we use the antiderivative of \\( e^{(1+i)s} \\), which is \\( \\frac{e^{(1+i)s}}{1+i} \\).\n   - Evaluating from 0 to t gives us \\( \\left[ \\frac{e^{(1+i)t}}{1+i} - \\frac{1}{1+i} \\right] \\).\n\n4. Simplify the expression:\n   - We can simplify further by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of \\( 1+i \\), which is \\( 1-i \\).\n   - This gives us \\( \\frac{e^{(1+i)t}(1-i) - (1-i)}{2} \\).\n\n5. Now, let's consider if we can determine the original form of \\( z(t) \\) from \\( T[z](t) \\):\n   - The expression for \\( T[z](t) \\) involves \\( e^{(1+i)t} \\), but it also includes a term that depends on \\( t \\).\n   - Without knowing the exact value of \\( t \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( e^{it} \\) just from \\( T[z](t) \\).\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - While \\( T[z](t) \\) contains information about \\( e^{it} \\), the additional terms make it impossible to uniquely determine the original form of \\( z(t) \\) solely from \\( T[z](T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
