This transformation converts the spatial domain into the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Evolution in Frequency Domain**: In the frequency domain, the heat equation simplifies significantly. Specifically, the Fourier transform of the heat equation gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}(k,t)}{\\partial t} = -\\kappa |k|^2 \\hat{u}(k,t)\n   \\]\n   This is a simple ordinary differential equation in time for each \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Solution in Frequency Domain**: Solving the above ODE, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k,t) = \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-\\kappa |k|^2 t}\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Fourier transform of the temperature distribution evolves exponentially with time, depending on the magnitude of \\( k \\).\n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find the temperature distribution \\( u(x,t) \\) in the spatial domain, we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\):\n   \\[\n   u(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k,t)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[ \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-\\kappa |k|^2 t} ]\n   \\]\n\n6. **Comparison with Direct Evolution**: If we were to directly evolve \\( u(x,0) \\) using the heat equation without any Fourier transforms, we would have:\n   \\[\n   u(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-\\kappa |k|^2 t}]\n   \\]\n   This is exactly the same expression as obtained from the Fourier transform method, confirming that the Fourier transform method and direct evolution yield the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Both methods should yield the same result because the Fourier transform diagonalizes the Laplacian operator, simplifying the PDE to a set of uncoupled ODEs in the frequency domain.\n\nTherefore, applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and allowing it to evolve according to the transformed equation is mathematically equivalent to evolving the initial condition directly in the spatial domain.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition and Fourier Transform**: \n   - The initial temperature distribution is \\( u(x, 0) \\).\n   - Applying the Fourier transform to \\( u(x, 0) \\) gives us \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) = \\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0)) \\).\n\n2. **Heat Equation in Frequency Domain**:\n   - The given heat equation is \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\kappa \\Delta u \\).\n   - When we apply the Fourier transform to both sides, it converts the spatial derivatives into algebraic operations. Specifically, \\( \\Delta u \\) transforms to \\( -|\\xi|^2 \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) \\). Thus, the transformed equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}(\\xi, t)}{\\partial t} = -\\kappa |\\xi|^2 \\hat{u}(\\xi, t)\n     \\]\n   - This is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time for each frequency component.\n\n3. **Solving the ODE**:\n   - The solution to this ODE is:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) = \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) e^{-\\kappa |\\xi|^2 t}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting back \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) = \\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0)) \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) = \\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0)) e^{-\\kappa |\\xi|^2 t}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:\n   - To find \\( u(x, t) \\), we take the inverse Fourier transform of \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) \\):\n     \\[\n     u(x, t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0)) e^{-\\kappa |\\xi|^2 t}]\n     \\]\n   - Using the convolution theorem, this can be written as:\n     \\[\n     u(x, t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))] * e^{-\\kappa \\Delta t}\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}(u(x, 0))] = u(x, 0) \\), so:\n     \\[\n     u(x, t) = u(x, 0) * e^{-\\kappa \\Delta t}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Comparison with Direct Evolution**:\n   - If \\( u(x, 0) \\) were directly evolved under the heat equation, the solution would be:\n     \\[\n     u(x, t) = u(x, 0) * e^{-\\kappa \\Delta t}\n     \\]\n   - This matches exactly with the result from the Fourier transform approach.\n\nTherefore, applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and then evolving it is equivalent to directly evolving the initial condition without the Fourier transform.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with an initial temperature distribution \\( u(x, 0) \\) which evolves over time according to the heat equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\kappa \\Delta u \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) to the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\) gives us \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) \\), where \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) = \\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)] \\).\n\n3. **Evolution Under Heat Equation**: The heat equation can be solved using the Fourier transform. When we apply the Fourier transform to the heat equation, it transforms into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in frequency space:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -\\kappa |\\xi|^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   This ODE can be solved analytically as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) = \\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) e^{-\\kappa |\\xi|^2 t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find the temperature profile at a later time \\( t \\), we need to take the inverse Fourier transform of \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) \\):\n   \\[\n   u(x, t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(\\xi, t)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(\\xi, 0) e^{-\\kappa |\\xi|^2 t}]\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**: If we directly evolve \\( u(x, 0) \\) under the heat equation without any Fourier transform, we would have:\n   \\[\n   u(x, t) = u(x, 0) e^{-\\kappa \\Delta t}\n   \\]\n   However, since \\( \\Delta u \\) is a spatial derivative, the direct evolution would involve solving the PDE in the original domain.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The key point here is that the Fourier transform converts the spatial derivatives into multiplication by \\( |\\xi|^2 \\) in the frequency domain, which simplifies the evolution equation to an ODE. The solution obtained by evolving in the frequency domain and then transforming back is equivalent to evolving the initial condition directly in the spatial domain for the heat equation.\n\nTherefore, the temperature profile \\( u(x, t) \\) at a later time \\( t \\) will indeed be the same whether we apply the Fourier transform to the initial condition and then evolve it, or if we evolve the initial condition directly under the heat equation.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
