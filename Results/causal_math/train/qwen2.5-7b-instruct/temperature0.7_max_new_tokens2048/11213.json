This means that if \\( z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 \\), then \\( T(z_0) = (x_0^2 - y_0^2) + i(2x_0y_0) \\).\n\n3. **Composition of Functions**: When we consider \\( f(T(z_0)) \\), we are essentially substituting \\( T(z_0) \\) into \\( f \\). If \\( f \\) is analytic at \\( z_0 \\), it means that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied at \\( z_0 \\). However, the analyticity of \\( f \\) at \\( z_0 \\) does not directly imply anything about the analyticity of \\( f(T(z_0)) \\) because \\( T(z_0) \\) is a new point in the complex plane.\n\n4. **Analyticity of \\( f(T(z_0)) \\)**: For \\( f(T(z_0)) \\) to be analytic, the function \\( f \\) must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations at the points \\( T(z_0) \\).

    "To determine whether the resulting function \\( f(T(z_0)) \\) is guaranteed to be analytic if \\( f \\) was analytic, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The function \\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\) is analytic in a region. This means that both \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations in that region.\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation \\( T(z) = z^2 \\) maps a complex number \\( z \\) to \\( z^2 \\). For a complex number \\( z = x + iy \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = (x + iy)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy\n   \\]\n   So, \\( T(z) = u_T(x, y) + iv_T(x, y) \\), where \\( u_T(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 \\) and \\( v_T(x, y) = 2xy \\).\n\n3. **Composition of Functions**: We need to consider the composition \\( f(T(z)) \\). If \\( T(z) = w \\), then \\( w = u_T(x, y) + iv_T(x, y) \\). Therefore, \\( f(T(z)) = f(w) = u(u_T, v_T) + iv(u_T, v_T) \\).\n\n4. **Analyticity of Composition**: For \\( f(T(z)) \\) to be analytic, it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations with respect to \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Given that \\( f(z) \\) is analytic, it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).

Specifically, if \\( f \\) is analytic and \\( T \\) is analytic, then the composition \\( f(T(z)) \\) is also analytic.

This follows from the fact that the composition of two analytic functions is analytic.\n\n4. **Applying \\( T \\) to \\( z_0 \\)**: When \\( T(z) = z^2 \\) is applied to \\( z_0 \\), we get \\( T(z_0) = z_0^2 \\).

    "To determine if the function \\( f(T(z_0)) \\) is guaranteed to be analytic when \\( T(z) = z^2 \\) is applied to a complex variable \\( z_0 \\) and then \\( f \\) is computed, we need to consider the properties of analytic functions and the transformation.\n\n1. **Analyticity Definition**: A function \\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\) is analytic in a region if it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations and has continuous partial derivatives in that region.\n\n2. **Transformation \\( T(z) = z^2 \\)**: This is a polynomial transformation, and polynomials are entire functions (analytic everywhere in the complex plane).\n\n3. **Composition of Analytic Functions**: If \\( f \\) is analytic and \\( T \\) is an analytic function, then the composition \\( f(T(z)) \\) is also analytic. This follows from the fact that both \\( f \\) and \\( T \\) are differentiable (since they satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations and have continuous partial derivatives), and the composition of two differentiable functions is differentiable.\n\n4. **Applying the Transformation**: When \\( T(z_0) = z_0^2 \\), the function \\( f(T(z_0)) = f(z_0^2) \\). Since \\( f \\) is analytic and \\( T(z) = z^2 \\) is analytic, the composition \\( f(z_0^2) \\) will also be analytic.\n\nGiven these points, the resulting function \\( f(T(z_0)) \\) is indeed guaranteed to be analytic if \\( f \\) was analytic.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
