Let’s denote the new initial state as \\(x(0)_\\text{new}\\). This new state is given by:\n   \\[\n   x(0)_\\text{new} = x(0) + h(x)\n   \\]\n\n4. **System Evolution**: The system is then evolved from \\(x(0)_\\text{new}\\) to time \\(T\\) under the original dynamics without any additional inputs. Mathematically, this evolution can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   x(T) = e^{DT}x(0)_\\text{new}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(x(0)_\\text{new}\\):\n   \\[\n   x(T) = e^{DT}(x(0) + h(x))\n   \\]\n\n5. **Continuous Input Application**: If the system were evolved from the initial state \\(x(0)\\) with the input \\(u\\) applied continuously over the interval \\([0, T]\\), the state at time \\(T\\) would be:\n   \\[\n   x(T) = e^{DT}x(0) + \\int_0^T e^{D(T-\\tau)}Bu(\\tau) \\, d\\tau\n   \\]\n   Notice that the term \\(\\int_0^T e^{D(T-\\tau)}Bu(\\tau) \\, d\\tau\\) is exactly the same as \\(h(x)\\).\n\n6. **Comparison**:\n   - When \\(h(x)\\) is applied to the initial state \\(x(0)\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     x(T) = e^{DT}(x(0) + h(x)) = e^{DT}x(0) + e^{DT}h(x)\n     \\]\n   - When the system evolves with continuous input \\(u\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     x(T) = e^{DT}x(0) + \\int_0^T e^{D(T-\\tau)}Bu(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = e^{DT}x(0) + e^{DT}h(x)\n     \\]\n\nSince both expressions for \\(x(T)\\) are identical, the application of \\(h(x)\\) to the initial state \\(x(0)\\) and then evolving the system without additional inputs results in the same state at time \\(T\\) as evolving the system with the input \\(u\\) applied continuously.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
