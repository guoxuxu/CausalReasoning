This implies that \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) evolve independently according to their respective exponential growth/decay rates.\n\n2. **Transformation 1**: A transformation \\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) is applied, where \\( C \\) is a complex constant. This transformation scales \\( z(t) \\) by \\( e^{Ct} \\). However, since \\( C \\) is a constant, it does not change the underlying dynamics of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\); it only scales the entire function \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a new transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) is applied, where \\( D \\) is another complex constant. Similar to the first transformation, this also scales \\( z(t) \\) by \\( e^{Dt} \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Effect on Dynamics**: The key point here is to understand how these transformations affect the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\). Since both transformations \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) scale the function \\( z(t) \\) but do not alter the underlying dynamics defined by \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\), the evolution of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) remains governed by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) respectively.\n\n5. **Endpoint Calculation**:\n   - Before \\( t_1 \\), \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\).\n   - At \\( t_1 \\), the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) starts affecting \\( z(t) \\).\n\nThe endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[ z(T) = e^{(A+B)(T-t_1)}z(t_1) \\cdot e^{D(T-t_1)} \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ z(T) = e^{(A+B)(T-t_1) + D(T-t_1)}z(t_1) \\]\n\nHere, the term \\( e^{(A+B)(T-t_1)} \\) represents the effect of the original dynamics, and \\( e^{D(T-t_1)} \\) represents the scaling due to the intervention \\( g(z) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: While the intervention \\( g(z) \\) affects the scaling factor, it does not change the fundamental dynamics driven by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) through the term \\( e^{(A+B)(T-t_1)} \\).\n\nTherefore, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), but it also depends on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) through the scaling factors.
