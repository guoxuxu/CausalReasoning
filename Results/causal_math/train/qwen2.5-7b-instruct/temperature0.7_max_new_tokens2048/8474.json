    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the given function**: The function \\( z(t) \\) is defined as an integral involving a matrix exponential and a constant vector.

For a function \\( f(t) \\), its Laplace transform is denoted as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} \\).\n\n3. **Transforming the integral**: We need to apply the Laplace transform to \\( z(t) \\).
