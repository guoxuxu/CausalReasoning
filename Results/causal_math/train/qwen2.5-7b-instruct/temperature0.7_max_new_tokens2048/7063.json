    "To determine if the final frequency spectrum \\(\\hat{f}''(\\omega)\\) is a simple superposition of the \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) frequency shifts, let's reason through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Modulation by \\(g(t)\\):**\n   - The initial modulation by \\(g(t) = e^{i\\alpha t}\\) transforms the original signal \\(f(t)\\) to \\(f(t) \\cdot g(t) = f(t) \\cdot e^{i\\alpha t}\\).\n   - The Fourier transform of this modulated signal is:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{f}_1(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} [f(t) \\cdot e^{i\\alpha t}] e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-i(\\omega - \\alpha)t} dt = \\hat{f}(\\omega - \\alpha)\n     \\]\n   - This shows that the initial modulation shifts the frequency spectrum by \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n2. **Intervention with \\(h(t)\\):**\n   - At a specific time \\(t_1\\), an additional modulation by \\(h(t) = e^{i\\beta t}\\) is applied.\n   - This can be interpreted as multiplying the signal at time \\(t_1\\) by \\(e^{i\\beta t_1}\\). However, since we are considering the effect on the frequency domain, we need to understand how this affects the Fourier transform.\n   - The intervention at time \\(t_1\\) can be seen as a point-wise multiplication in the time domain, which corresponds to a convolution in the frequency domain. But for simplicity, we consider the effect at the frequency spectrum level.\n\n3. **Effect of Additional Modulation:**\n   - Multiplying by \\(e^{i\\beta t_1}\\) at a specific time \\(t_1\\) does not change the overall frequency spectrum in a simple manner. Instead, it introduces a phase shift at that specific time.\n   - The effect of this intervention is not a simple addition of the frequencies \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) but rather a more complex interaction due to the non-linear nature of the phase shift introduced.\n\n4. **Final Frequency Spectrum:**\n   - The final frequency spectrum \\(\\hat{f}''(\\omega)\\) will include the effects of both modulations but will not be a simple superposition of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). It will involve the convolution or more complex interactions due to the intervention at \\(t_1\\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"

    "To determine if the final frequency spectrum \\(\\hat{f}''(\\omega)\\) will be a simple superposition of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) frequency shifts, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Modulation by \\(g(t)\\):**\n   - The initial modulation by \\(g(t) = e^{i\\alpha t}\\) on the signal \\(f(t)\\) results in a new signal \\(f'(t) = f(t) \\cdot g(t) = f(t) \\cdot e^{i\\alpha t}\\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\(f'(t)\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{f}'(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{i\\alpha t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-i(\\omega - \\alpha)t} dt.\n     \\]\n   - This shows that the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{f}'(\\omega)\\) is a frequency shift of \\(\\hat{f}(\\omega)\\) by \\(\\alpha\\).\n\n2. **Intervention with Modulation \\(h(t)\\):**\n   - At time \\(t_1\\), we apply another modulation \\(h(t) = e^{i\\beta t}\\) to the signal \\(f'(t)\\).\n   - The new signal becomes \\(f''(t) = f'(t) \\cdot h(t) = f(t) \\cdot e^{i\\alpha t} \\cdot e^{i\\beta t} = f(t) \\cdot e^{i(\\alpha + \\beta) t}\\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\(f''(t)\\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\hat{f}''(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{i(\\alpha + \\beta) t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-i(\\omega - (\\alpha + \\beta))t} dt.\n     \\]\n   - This indicates that the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{f}''(\\omega)\\) is a frequency shift of \\(\\hat{f}'(\\omega)\\) by \\(\\beta\\).\n\n3. **Final Frequency Spectrum Analysis:**\n   - From the above steps, we see that the application of \\(h(t)\\) at \\(t_1\\) results in a further frequency shift from \\(\\alpha\\) to \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\).\n   - Therefore, the final frequency spectrum \\(\\hat{f}''(\\omega)\\) is not a simple superposition of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) but rather a single frequency shift by \\(\\alpha + \\beta\\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
