    "To analyze whether we can recover the original function \\(f(t)\\) from the transformed function \\(F(s)\\) without knowing the exponent \\(n\\) used in the time-dependent factor \\(t^n\\), let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Transformation**: The original function is \\(f(t)\\), and its Laplace transform is \\(F(s) = L\\{f(t)\\}\\).\n\n2. **New Function**: The new function is \\(g(t) = t^n f(t)\\), where \\(n\\) is a non-negative integer.\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of New Function**: The Laplace transform of \\(g(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = L\\{t^n f(t)\\}\n   \\]\n   According to the properties of the Laplace transform, specifically the frequency differentiation property, we have:\n   \\[\n   L\\{t^n f(t)\\} = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} F(s)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(G(s) = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} F(s)\\).\n\n4. **Recovering \\(f(t)\\)**: To recover \\(f(t)\\) from \\(G(s)\\), we would need to apply the inverse Laplace transform to \\(G(s)\\):\n   \\[\n   f(t) = L^{-1}\\{G(s)\\}\n   \\]\n   Since \\(G(s) = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} F(s)\\), the inverse Laplace transform involves inverting a differential operation on \\(F(s)\\). However, the key issue here is that the differential operation depends on \\(n\\), which is unknown.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without knowing \\(n\\), it is impossible to correctly perform the inverse operation to recover \\(f(t)\\) from \\(G(s)\\). Different values of \\(n\\) will lead to different differential operations, making it impossible to uniquely determine \\(f(t)\\) without additional information about \\(n\\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
