The influence of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is cumulative and depends on their interaction, but the initial phase due to \\(\\omega\\) is still present.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The system at time \\(T > t_1\\) will reflect an influence from both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), but it will also continue to reflect the influence of \\(\\omega\\) through the initial phase of the exponential term.

Since \\( z(t) \\) is on the unit circle, \\( A \\) will generally map it to another point on or off the unit circle, depending on \\( A \\).\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), we apply a secondary transformation \\( g(z) = Bz \\).
