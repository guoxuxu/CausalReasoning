    "To address this problem, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Equation**: The Laplace equation \\(\\nabla^2 v = 0\\) describes a potential function \\(v\\) that is harmonic (i.e., its second derivatives sum to zero) within a domain \\(\\Omega\\).\n\n2. **Boundary Condition**: The boundary condition on \\(\\Gamma\\) is initially given as \\(v = g\\), where \\(g\\) is some function defined on \\(\\Gamma\\).
