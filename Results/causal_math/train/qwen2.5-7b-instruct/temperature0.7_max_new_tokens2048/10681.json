The inverse Laplace transform of \\( Y(s) \\) gives \\( y(t) \\), the time-domain output of the system.\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**: Since \\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\) directly determines \\( y(t) \\) via the inverse Laplace transform, it follows that \\( y(t) \\) is solely dependent on the forms of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( U(s) \\). The initial conditions do not explicitly appear in the equation for \\( Y(s) \\) unless they are included in \\( H(s) \\), but under natural response (zero initial conditions), they do not influence the output.\n\nGiven this analysis, the output \\( y(t) \\) will indeed solely depend on the initial forms of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( U(s) \\) when the system responds naturally.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the output \\( y(t) \\) will solely depend on the initial forms of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( U(s) \\) when the input signal \\( u(t) \\) is specified without any modifications, let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **System Representation**: The system is described by its Laplace transform \\( X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\) and its response to the input signal \\( u(t) \\) is given by \\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\), where \\( H(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\} \\) is the transfer function of the system.\n\n2. **Impulse Response and Transfer Function**: The impulse response \\( h(t) \\) of the system is the output of the system when the input is an impulse function \\( \\delta(t) \\). The transfer function \\( H(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of the impulse response \\( h(t) \\).\n\n3. **Output in Frequency Domain**: The output \\( Y(s) \\) in the frequency domain is given by the product of the transfer function \\( H(s) \\) and the Laplace transform of the input signal \\( U(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = H(s)U(s)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To find the time-domain output \\( y(t) \\), we take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( Y(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)U(s)\\}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**: Since \\( Y(s) = H(s)U(s) \\) and \\( y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{Y(s)\\} \\), the output \\( y(t) \\) depends directly on both \\( H(s) \\) and \\( U(s) \\). There are no other factors mentioned that would influence \\( y(t) \\) under the assumption that the system responds naturally to the input \\( u(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the output \\( y(t) \\) will solely depend on the initial forms of \\( H(s) \\) and \\( U(s) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
