Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{C} \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz = 2\\pi i\n   \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since the integral of \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\) around any closed contour that encloses the origin is \\( 2\\pi i \\), the value of \\( T(f) \\) is not zero but rather \\( 2\\pi i \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( T(f) \\) does indeed change from zero when the contour \\( C \\) encloses the origin.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding \\( f(z) \\):**\n   - The function \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) has a singularity at \\( z = 0 \\). This means that the function is not defined at \\( z = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation \\( T(f) \\):**\n   - The transformation \\( T(f) = \\int_{C} f(z) \\, dz \\) involves integrating \\( f(z) \\) over a closed contour \\( C \\) that encloses the origin.\n\n3. **Residue Theorem Application:**\n   - According to the Residue Theorem, for a function \\( f(z) \\) with isolated singularities inside a closed contour \\( C \\), the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over \\( C \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{C} f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\sum \\text{Res}(f, z_k)\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\text{Res}(f, z_k) \\) is the residue of \\( f(z) \\) at each singularity \\( z_k \\) inside \\( C \\).\n\n4. **Residue Calculation:**\n   - For \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\), the only singularity is at \\( z = 0 \\).\n   - The residue of \\( f(z) \\) at \\( z = 0 \\) is the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\) in the Laurent series expansion of \\( f(z) \\) around \\( z = 0 \\), which is simply 1.\n   - Therefore, the residue of \\( f(z) \\) at \\( z = 0 \\) is 1.\n\n5. **Applying the Residue Theorem:**\n   - Since the residue at \\( z = 0 \\) is 1, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{C} \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\times 1 = 2\\pi i\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The value of \\( T(f) \\) is \\( 2\\pi i \\), which is non-zero.\n\nTherefore, if the function \\( f(z) \\) is defined without singularity handling and the contour \\( C \\) encloses the origin, the value of \\( T(f) \\) does not remain zero but instead equals \\( 2\\pi i \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
