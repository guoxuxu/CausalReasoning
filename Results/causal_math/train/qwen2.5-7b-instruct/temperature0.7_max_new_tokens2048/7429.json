    "To determine if \\( g(s) \\) preserves the original features of \\( h(x) \\) such that \\( h(x) \\) can be fully reconstructed from \\( g(s) \\), we need to analyze the properties of the transformation and its potential invertibility.\n\n1. **Transformation Analysis**:\n   - The kernel \\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\) is a Gaussian function centered at \\( s \\).\n   - The transformation is defined as \\( g(s) = \\int h(x) K(x, s) dx = \\int h(x) e^{-(x-s)^2} dx \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Consideration**:\n   - The Gaussian function \\( e^{-(x-s)^2} \\) is its own Fourier transform up to scaling.\n   - If we apply a Fourier transform to both sides of the integral equation, the convolution property of Fourier transforms comes into play.

    "To determine if \\( g(s) \\) preserves the original features of \\( h(x) \\) such that \\( h(x) \\) can be fully reconstructed from \\( g(s) \\), let's analyze the given transformation step by step.\n\n1. **Transformation Definition**: The transformation is defined as:\n   \\[\n   g(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(x) K(x, s) \\, dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(x) e^{-(x-s)^2} \\, dx\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\) is a Gaussian kernel centered at \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Kernel Analysis**: The kernel \\( K(x, s) \\) is a Gaussian function which is symmetric around \\( s \\). It has a peak at \\( x = s \\) and decays rapidly away from this point. This means that for any fixed \\( s \\), the value of \\( g(s) \\) is a weighted average of \\( h(x) \\) with weights determined by the Gaussian distribution centered at \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Reversibility**: To check if \\( h(x) \\) can be fully reconstructed from \\( g(s) \\), we need to consider if there exists an inverse transformation. In other words, can we find \\( h(x) \\) uniquely from \\( g(s) \\)?\n\n4. **Fourier Transform Insight**: The given transformation can be viewed as a convolution in the spatial domain, which corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain. Specifically, the Fourier transform of the Gaussian kernel \\( K(x, s) \\) is another Gaussian function. Therefore, the Fourier transform of \\( g(s) \\) would be related to the Fourier transform of \\( h(x) \\) by a simple scaling factor.\n\n5. **Reconstruction Possibility**: Given that the kernel \\( K(x, s) \\) is a Gaussian, which is a well-behaved and invertible function in the context of integral transforms, it implies that \\( h(x) \\) can indeed be uniquely reconstructed from \\( g(s) \\) under appropriate conditions (such as sufficient smoothness and decay of \\( h(x) \\)).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the transformation involves a Gaussian kernel, which is known to be invertible in many contexts, and assuming \\( h(x) \\) is appropriately behaved, \\( h(x) \\) can be fully reconstructed from \\( g(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Kernel Transformation**: The kernel \\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\) is a Gaussian function centered at \\( s \\). This kernel has a peak at \\( x = s \\) and its value decays rapidly as \\( x \\) moves away from \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Transformation of \\( h(x) \\)**: The transformation \\( g(s) = \\int h(x) K(x, s) dx \\) essentially convolves \\( h(x) \\) with the Gaussian kernel \\( K(x, s) \\). This convolution smooths out \\( h(x) \\) and spreads its values over a range around each point \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Reversibility Consideration**: For \\( h(x) \\) to be fully reconstructible from \\( g(s) \\), the transformation must be invertible. Convolution with a Gaussian kernel is not generally invertible without additional information because it smears the original signal, making it difficult to uniquely determine the original function from the smoothed version.\n\n4. **Fourier Domain Analysis**: In the Fourier domain, the convolution theorem states that convolution in the spatial domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain. The Fourier transform of the Gaussian kernel is another Gaussian function. Multiplying by a Gaussian in the frequency domain results in a spread of the spectrum, which typically makes the signal less distinguishable.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the transformation involves smoothing (convolution with a Gaussian), there is no general method to perfectly reconstruct \\( h(x) \\) from \\( g(s) \\) without additional information about \\( h(x) \\) or constraints on \\( h(x) \\).

    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation involves convolving the function \\( h(x) \\) with the Gaussian kernel \\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\).

Gausssian functions have several important properties:\n   - They are smooth and infinitely differentiable.\n   - They have a bell-shaped curve and decay rapidly away from the center.\n   - They form a complete basis in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}) \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform and Inverse**: The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is another Gaussian function. Importantly, the convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of a convolution of two functions is the product of their Fourier transforms.\n\n4. **Reversibility via Fourier Transform**: Given the properties of the Gaussian kernel, we can use the Fourier transform to reverse the convolution process. Specifically, the Fourier transform of \\( g(s) \\) would give us information about \\( h(x) \\), because the Fourier transform of the convolution is the product of the Fourier transforms of the individual functions.\n\n5. **Conditions for Reversibility**: For the transformation to be reversible, the kernel must be invertible in the frequency domain. Since the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian (which is non-zero everywhere), the transformation is indeed invertible.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the Gaussian kernel is a well-behaved, smooth function that forms a complete basis in \\( L^2(\\mathbb{R}) \\), and considering the properties of the Fourier transform, the original function \\( h(x) \\) can be fully reconstructed from \\( g(s) \\) without any loss of information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To answer this question, let's break down the process and analyze it step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**:\n   - The transformation is defined as \\( g(s) = \\int h(x) K(x, s) dx \\), where \\( K(x, s) = e^{-(x-s)^2} \\).\n   - This is essentially a convolution of the function \\( h(x) \\) with the Gaussian kernel \\( K(x, s) \\).\n\n2. **Properties of the Kernel**:\n   - The kernel \\( K(x, s) \\) is a Gaussian function centered at \\( s \\).
