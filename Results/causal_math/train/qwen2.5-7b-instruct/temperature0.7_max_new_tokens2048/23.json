This is an instantaneous change that can be considered a perturbation. Over time, depending on the value of \\(D\\), the effect of this perturbation might diminish or persist, but it will still be influenced by \\(D\\).\n\n5. **Dependency on \\(D\\)**: The key factor here is the diffusion coefficient \\(D\\). Since the PDE is driven by \\(D\\), any long-term behavior of the system will be governed by \\(D\\). The initial conditions modified by \\(h(z)\\) and the instantaneous perturbation added by \\(j(z)\\) will eventually be smoothed out by the diffusion process defined by \\(D\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the final state \\(z(T)\\) will indeed depend on \\(D\\) because the diffusion process is the primary driver of the system's evolution. While \\(h(z)\\) and \\(j(z)\\) can influence the initial state and possibly intermediate states, their effects will be moderated by the diffusion process defined by \\(D\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
