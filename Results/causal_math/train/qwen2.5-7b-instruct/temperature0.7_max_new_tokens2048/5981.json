Therefore, \\(u(x,y)\\) and \\(v(x,y)\\) should be considered as functions of a single variable for the Laplace transform to be meaningful in this context.\n   - If we assume \\(u(x,y)\\) and \\(v(x,y)\\) are actually functions of a single variable \\(t\\) (which is not explicitly stated but inferred from the Laplace transform definition), then the Laplace transforms can be applied as follows:\n     - \\(L[u(x,y)](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} u(x,y) dt\\)\n     - \\(L[v(x,y)](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} v(x,y) dt\\)\n\n3. **Combining the Transforms:**\n   - The proposed statement suggests that \\(L[z](s) = L[u](s) + i L[v](s)\\).\n   - For this to be true, \\(z\\) must be considered as a function of \\(t\\), and the Laplace transform properties must hold.\n\n4. **Laplace Transform Property for Complex Functions:**\n   - If \\(z(t) = u(t) + iv(t)\\), then the Laplace transform of \\(z(t)\\) is indeed \\(L[z(t)](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} [u(t) + iv(t)] dt\\).\n   - By linearity of the integral, this can be split into two separate integrals:\n     \\[\n     L[z(t)](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} u(t) dt + i \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} v(t) dt = L[u(t)](s) + i L[v(t)](s)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The proposed statement is correct under the assumption that \\(u(x,y)\\) and \\(v(x,y)\\) are functions of a single variable \\(t\\), and the Laplace transform is applied accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if \\( L[z](s) = L[u](s) + i L[v](s) \\) is a valid Laplace transform of \\( z \\), let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Definition of Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is defined as \\( L[f](s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) dt \\).\n\n2. **Complex Function Representation**: The given function is \\( z = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\), where \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are real-valued functions of real variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n3. **Applying Laplace Transform to Real Parts**:\n   - Applying the Laplace transform to \\( u(x,y) \\) results in \\( L[u](s) \\).\n   - Applying the Laplace transform to \\( v(x,y) \\) results in \\( L[v](s) \\).\n\n4. **Combining the Transforms**:\n   - According to linearity property of the Laplace transform, if \\( f_1(t) \\) and \\( f_2(t) \\) are two functions, and \\( c_1 \\) and \\( c_2 \\) are constants, then \\( L[c_1 f_1(t) + c_2 f_2(t)] = c_1 L[f_1](s) + c_2 L[f_2](s) \\).\n   - In our case, we have \\( z = u(x,y) + iv(x,y) \\). If we treat \\( u(x,y) \\) and \\( v(x,y) \\) as functions of a single variable \\( t \\) (which is not strictly correct but for the purpose of applying the Laplace transform), we can consider the real and imaginary parts separately.\n\n5. **Forming the Laplace Transform of \\( z \\)**:\n   - By treating \\( u(x,y) \\) and \\( v(x,y) \\) as functions of \\( t \\), the Laplace transform of \\( z \\) would be \\( L[z](s) = L[u(x,y)](s) + i L[v(x,y)](s) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the Laplace transform is linear, the above expression is indeed valid. Therefore, \\( L[z](s) = L[u](s) + i L[v](s] \\) is the correct Laplace transform of \\( z \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
