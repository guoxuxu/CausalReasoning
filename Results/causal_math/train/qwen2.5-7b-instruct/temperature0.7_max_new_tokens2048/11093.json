    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial System Analysis**:\n   - The original system has a transfer function given by \\( Z(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d} \\).\n   - This represents a second-order system with poles at the roots of the denominator polynomial.\n\n2. **Adding a Parallel Capacitor**:\n   - A parallel capacitor adds a new term to the system, changing its impedance from \\( Z(s) \\) to \\( Z'(s) = Z(s) \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{sC \\cdot Z(s)}\\right) \\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\( Z'(s) = \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{sC \\cdot Z(s)}}{1} = \\frac{sC \\cdot Z(s) + 1}{sC \\cdot Z(s)} \\).\n\n3. **Effect on Transfer Function**:\n   - The new transfer function becomes \\( H'(s) = \\frac{N'(s)}{D'(s)} \\), where \\( N'(s) = 1 + \\frac{1}{sC \\cdot Z(s)} \\) and \\( D'(s) = sC \\cdot Z(s) \\).\n   - Substituting \\( Z(s) \\) into \\( N'(s) \\) and \\( D'(s) \\), we get \\( H'(s) = \\frac{sC \\cdot \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d} + 1}{sC \\cdot \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d}} \\).\n   - Simplifying further, \\( H'(s) = \\frac{(sC \\cdot (s^2 + as + b) + s^2 + cs + d)}{(sC \\cdot (s^2 + as + b))} \\).\n   - This simplifies to \\( H'(s) = \\frac{s^3 + as^2 + bsC + s^2 + cs + d}{s^3C + as^2C + bsC^2 + dC} \\).\n\n4. **Steady-State Output Comparison**:\n   - For a sinusoidal input, the steady-state response is determined by the frequency-dependent behavior of the transfer function.\n   - The presence of the parallel capacitor introduces additional terms that modify the numerator and denominator of the transfer function.\n   - These modifications affect the phase and magnitude response of the system at different frequencies.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the addition of the parallel capacitor changes the transfer function, the steady-state response to a sinusoidal input will generally be different from the original system without the capacitor.\n\nTherefore, the steady-state output of the system will not be the same as it was without the capacitor.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the steady-state output of the system remains the same after adding a parallel capacitor, let's analyze the impact step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial System**: The initial system has a complex impedance given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Adding a Parallel Capacitor**: When a parallel capacitor with impedance \\( \\frac{1}{sC} \\) is added, the new total impedance \\( Z_{\\text{new}}(s) \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\left( Z(s) + \\frac{1}{sC} \\right)^{-1}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( Z(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\left( \\frac{s^2 + as + b}{s^2 + cs + d} + \\frac{1}{sC} \\right)^{-1}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\left( \\frac{(s^2 + as + b)sC + (s^2 + cs + d)}{sC(s^2 + cs + d)} \\right)^{-1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\frac{sC(s^2 + cs + d)}{(s^2 + as + b)sC + (s^2 + cs + d)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\frac{s^3 + cs^2 + dsC}{s^3 + (a + c)s^2 + (b + d)sC + d}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Steady-State Output**: For a sinusoidal input, the system response in the frequency domain (i.e., \\( s = j\\omega \\)) can be analyzed. The transfer function of the system is given by the ratio of the output to the input in the frequency domain. The presence of the additional capacitor changes the poles and zeros of the system, which can alter the frequency response.\n\n4. **Effect on Steady-State Output**: The addition of the parallel capacitor introduces a pole at \\( s = -\\frac{1}{j\\omega C} \\). This pole does not affect the steady-state response directly but can change the transient behavior and the overall frequency response of the system. However, for a sinusoidal input, the steady-state output is determined by the DC gain and the phase shift at the input frequency. Since the DC gain and phase shift of the system are altered due to the new poles and zeros, the steady-state output will generally differ from the original system.\n\nTherefore, the steady-state output of the system will not be the same as it was without the capacitor.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
