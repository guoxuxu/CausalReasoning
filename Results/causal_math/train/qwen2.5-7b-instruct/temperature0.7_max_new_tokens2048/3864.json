    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function and Transformation**:\n   - The function \\( u(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2} \\) is given.\n   - We need to consider how this function behaves under scaling and shifting in the spatial domain, and how these transformations affect its Fourier transform \\( U(f_x, f_y) \\).\n\n2. **Scaling Transformation**:\n   - If we apply a scaling transformation with a factor \\( \\alpha \\) to \\( u(x, y) \\), the new function becomes \\( u(\\alpha x, \\alpha y) \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( u(\\alpha x, \\alpha y) \\) will be \\( U\\left(\\frac{f_x}{\\alpha}, \\frac{f_y}{\\alpha}\\right) \\).

The magnitude of \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\) does not directly reveal the scaling factor without additional information about the original function or the transformed one.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the phase information in \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\) can help identify the shift vector \\( v \\), determining the exact scaling factor \\( \\alpha \\) requires more than just \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\); it would typically require knowledge of the original function or additional constraints.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

But if \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\) has been altered in ways other than simple scaling and shifting, this information alone may not be sufficient.\n\nGiven the lack of specific details about \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\) and its relationship to \\( U(f_x, f_y) \\), it is not generally feasible to precisely determine both the scaling factor \\( \\alpha \\) and the shift vector \\( v \\) solely based on \\( W(f_x, f_y) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
