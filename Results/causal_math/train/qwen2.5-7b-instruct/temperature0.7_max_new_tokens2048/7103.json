So, we need to consider the integral from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\) with this modified function.\n\n6. **Splitting the Integral**:\n   - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the integral can be split into two parts: one from 0 to \\( t_1 \\) and another from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\):\n     \\[\n     Tz(T) = \\int_0^{t_1} e^{(t_1-s)a} z(s) ds + \\int_{t_1}^T e^{(T-s)a} (z(s) + c) ds\n     \\]\n\n7. **Evaluating Each Part**:\n   - The first part remains unchanged and depends on \\( a \\) and \\( z(s) \\) for \\( s \\in [0, t_1] \\).\n   - The second part introduces a term involving \\( c \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int_{t_1}^T e^{(T-s)a} c ds = c \\int_{t_1}^T e^{(T-s)a} ds\n     \\]\n   - Evaluating the integral:\n     \\[\n     c \\int_{t_1}^T e^{(T-s)a} ds = c \\left[ \\frac{e^{(T-s)a}}{-a} \\right]_{t_1}^T = c \\left( \\frac{1}{-a} - \\frac{e^{(T-t_1)a}}{-a} \\right) = \\frac{c}{a} (1 - e^{(T-t_1)a})\n     \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The term \\( \\frac{c}{a} (1 - e^{(T-t_1)a}) \\) clearly depends on both \\( c \\) and \\( a \\).\n   - Therefore, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on \\( c \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
