    "To determine if we can recover the exact original function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) from its Fourier transform \\( F(z) \\) without any ambiguity, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the given differential equation**: The function \\( z(t) \\) satisfies the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\). This implies that \\( z(t) \\) is of the form \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} A e^{i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A dt\n   \\]\n   However, this integral does not converge for \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) because it is not absolutely integrable over the entire real line. Therefore, we need to consider the Fourier transform in the sense of distributions.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform in the Sense of Distributions**: For \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), the Fourier transform is known to be:\n   \\[\n   F(e^{i\\omega t}) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega_0 = \\omega \\).\n\n4. **Recovery of \\( z(t) \\) from \\( F(z) \\)**: Given the Fourier transform \\( F(z) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), we can use the inverse Fourier transform to recover \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(z) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega = e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n\nSince the Fourier transform and its inverse correctly map \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) back to itself, there is no ambiguity in recovering the original function from its Fourier transform.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
