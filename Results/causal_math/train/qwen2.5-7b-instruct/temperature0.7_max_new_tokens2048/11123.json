The resonant frequency remains constant and is determined solely by \\(L\\) and \\(C\\).\n\n5. **Adding a Shunt Capacitor**: The addition of the shunt capacitor \\(C\\) introduces a new component to the circuit, which can affect the overall impedance and behavior at different frequencies. However, the resonant frequency of the series RLC circuit is still defined by the relationship between \\(L\\) and \\(C\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the resonant frequency \\(\\omega_{resonant}\\) is determined by the values of \\(L\\) and \\(C\\) and not by the driving frequency \\(\\omega\\), increasing \\(\\omega\\) does not cause a shift in the resonant frequency of the circuit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Circuit Setup**: We have an inductor \\(L\\) and resistor \\(R\\) in series connected to an alternating voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\).\n\n2. **Effect of Frequency on Components**:\n   - The voltage across the inductor \\(V_L = L \\frac{dI}{dt}\\) increases with frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n   - The voltage across the resistor \\(V_R = RI\\) does not depend directly on \\(\\omega\\), but the current \\(I\\) changes with \\(\\omega\\).\n   - The total voltage \\(V\\) is the sum of \\(V_L\\) and \\(V_R\\).\n\n3. **Adding a Shunt Capacitor**:\n   - When a shunt capacitor \\(C\\) is added, it introduces a capacitive reactance \\(X_C = \\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\).\n   - The total impedance of the circuit now includes the inductive reactance \\(X_L = \\omega L\\) and the capacitive reactance \\(X_C\\).\n\n4. **Resonant Frequency**:\n   - Resonance occurs when the inductive reactance equals the capacitive reactance, i.e., \\(X_L = X_C\\).\n   - This gives us the resonant frequency \\(\\omega_{resonant} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}\\).\n\n5. **Effect of Increasing Frequency**:\n   - As we increase \\(\\omega\\), the inductive reactance \\(X_L\\) increases.\n   - For resonance, the capacitive reactance \\(X_C\\) must decrease to match \\(X_L\\).\n   - Since \\(X_C = \\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\), increasing \\(\\omega\\) decreases \\(X_C\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - If we increase \\(\\omega\\) while keeping \\(C\\) constant, the new resonant frequency \\(\\omega_{resonant}'\\) will be lower than the original \\(\\omega_{resonant}\\) because the balance between \\(X_L\\) and \\(X_C\\) shifts.\n   - Therefore, increasing the frequency \\(\\omega\\) will cause the resonant frequency of the circuit to shift to a lower value.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
