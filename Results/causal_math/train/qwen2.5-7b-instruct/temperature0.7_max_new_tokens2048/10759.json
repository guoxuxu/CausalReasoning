    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Given PDE**: The PDE given is \\(\\nabla^2 u = -\\lambda u\\), which is a Helmholtz equation. This equation describes how the function \\(u\\) changes in space and is associated with a specific frequency or wavenumber \\(\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier Transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a linear transformation that converts the spatial domain into the frequency domain. For the Helmholtz equation, applying the Fourier Transform leads to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the frequency domain. Specifically, if we take the Fourier Transform of both sides of the Helmholtz equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   -|\\xi|^2 \\hat{u}(\\xi) = -\\lambda \\hat{u}(\\xi)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\hat{u}(\\xi)\\) is the Fourier Transform of \\(u(x)\\), and \\(\\xi\\) is the frequency variable.

The Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is often used to solve such equations due to its ability to convert spatial derivatives into multiplications in the frequency domain.\n\n2. **Applying the Fourier Transform**: When we apply the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to the equation, it transforms the spatial derivatives into multiplications by \\(k^2\\) (where \\(k\\) is the wave number in the frequency domain).

The application of \\(D\\) at \\(t_1\\) introduces a change in the state of \\(u(x,t)\\) at that specific point in time. However, the future state \\(u(x,t > t_1)\\) will still depend on the dynamics of the PDE and how the initial conditions evolve over time.\n\n6. **Ignoring Effects of \\(D\\)**: If we ignore the effect of \\(D\\), then the state at any \\(t > t_1\\) would be determined by the original solution without the modification introduced by \\(D\\). But since \\(D\\) has already changed the state at \\(t_1\\), the future state cannot be independent of this change.\n\nGiven these points, the modified state at any \\(t > t_1\\) does indeed depend on the application of the differential operator \\(D\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
