    "To determine if the resultant state \\( y(T) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) strictly depends on the matrix \\( A \\) only and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\), let's analyze the system step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State and Transformation by \\( A \\):**\n   - The system is initially governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\), where \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n   - This matrix \\( A \\) represents a rotation in the plane.\n   - If we start from some initial state \\( y(0) \\), the state evolves according to \\( y(t) = e^{At} y(0) \\).\n\n2. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\):**\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention is applied with the function \\( g(y) = e^{Ct} y \\), where \\( C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n   - This intervention transforms the state from \\( y(t_1) \\) to \\( y(t_1) \\cdot e^{C(t-t_1)} \\).\n\n3. **Behavior Post-Intervention:**\n   - After the intervention, the system continues to evolve according to the original differential equation \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\).\n   - Therefore, for \\( t > t_1 \\), the state is given by \\( y(t) = e^{A(t-t_1)} y(t_1) \\cdot e^{C(t-t_1)} \\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Expression:**\n   - We can rewrite the expression for \\( y(t) \\) as:\n     \\[\n     y(t) = e^{A(t-t_1)} \\left( y(t_1) \\cdot e^{C(t-t_1)} \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Let \\( z(t_1) = y(t_1) \\cdot e^{C(t-t_1)} \\). Then:\n     \\[\n     y(t) = e^{A(t-t_1)} z(t_1)\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( z(t_1) \\) is determined by the state at \\( t_1 \\) and the intervention matrix \\( C \\), it includes information from both the initial state and the intervention.\n\n5. **Final State at \\( T > t_1 \\):**\n   - The state at any time \\( T > t_1 \\) is \\( y(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)} z(t_1) \\).\n   - While \\( e^{A(T-t_1)} \\) depends only on \\( A \\), the term \\( z(t_1) \\) depends on both the initial state and the intervention matrix \\( C \\).\n\nGiven that \\( z(t_1) \\) incorporates the influence of the intervention matrix \\( C \\), the final state \\( y(T) \\) cannot be said to strictly depend only on \\( A \\) without considering the effects of \\( B \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State and Evolution**: The initial state of the system is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\). Here, \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Function f(y)**: The function \\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\) with \\( B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\) also represents a rotational transformation but with a different angle and direction compared to \\( A \\). However, for the time interval from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = t_1 \\), the system evolves according to \\( A \\).\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the function \\( g(y) = e^{Ct}y \\) with \\( C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) is applied as an intervention. This introduces a scaling factor along the x-axis and a reflection along the y-axis.\n\n4. **State After Intervention**: The state after the intervention at \\( t_1 \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   y(t_1) = e^{C(t_1-0)}y(0) = e^{Ct_1}y(0)\n   \\]\n   where \\( y(0) \\) is the state just before the intervention.\n\n5. **System Behavior After \\( t_1 \\)**: After the intervention, the system continues to evolve according to the original dynamics \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\). So, the state at any time \\( T > t_1 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   y(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}e^{Ct_1}y(0)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The term \\( e^{A(T-t_1)} \\) depends solely on \\( A \\).\n   - The term \\( e^{Ct_1} \\) depends on both \\( C \\) and the time \\( t_1 \\) at which the intervention occurred.\n   \n   Therefore, the resultant state \\( y(T) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) does not strictly depend on \\( A \\) alone; it also depends on the intervention introduced by \\( C \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is that the resultant state \\( y(T) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on both \\( A \\) and \\( C \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To determine whether the resultant state \\( y(T) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) strictly depends on the matrix \\( A \\) only and not on \\( B \\) or \\( C \\), let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Initial System Dynamics:**\n   - The initial system is governed by the differential equation \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\), where \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n   - This matrix \\( A \\) represents a rotational transformation.\n\n2. **Effect of Function \\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\):**\n   - Here, \\( B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n   - The function \\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\) also results in a rotational transformation, but with a different angle compared to \\( A \\).\n\n3. **Intervention Function \\( g(y) = e^{Ct}y \\):**\n   - At a specific time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention is applied using the function \\( g(y) = e^{Ct}y \\), where \\( C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\).\n   - This matrix \\( C \\) represents a scaling transformation along the x-axis and a reflection across the x-axis.\n\n4. **Resultant State \\( y(T) \\):**\n   - We need to determine if the resultant state \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends strictly on \\( A \\) only, without influence from \\( B \\) or \\( C \\).\n\nLet's break down the effects:\n- Before \\( t_1 \\), the system evolves according to \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\).\n- At \\( t_1 \\), the state is transformed by \\( g(y) = e^{Ct_1}y \\). This introduces a scaling and reflection.\n- After \\( t_1 \\), the system continues to evolve according to \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\).\n\nThe key point is that after the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the system's dynamics are again governed by \\( A \\). The intervention does not change the underlying dynamics of the system; it only modifies the state at \\( t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the resultant state \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will still be determined by the dynamics described by \\( A \\), regardless of the intervention.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System Dynamics:**\n   - The original system is governed by \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\), where \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\). This matrix \\( A \\) represents a rotation in the plane.\n   - The function \\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\) with \\( B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\) also represents a rotational transformation but with a different angle and direction compared to \\( A \\).\n   - The function \\( g(y) = e^{Ct}y \\) with \\( C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\) represents a scaling transformation along the x-axis and y-axis independently.\n\n2. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\):**\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention is introduced by applying the function \\( g(y) = e^{Ct}y \\). This means that at \\( t = t_1 \\), the state \\( y(t_1) \\) is transformed according to \\( g(y) \\).\n\n3. **Effect on the System After Intervention:**\n   - After the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the system continues to evolve according to the original dynamics governed by \\( A \\). So, from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, the state \\( y(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) will be determined by \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\) starting from the state \\( y(t_1) \\) after the transformation by \\( g \\).\n\n4. **Final State \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\):**\n   - Since the intervention only affects the state at \\( t_1 \\) and the system then evolves according to \\( A \\) without further interventions, the state \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will be dependent on the initial state at \\( t_1 \\) transformed by \\( g \\) and then evolved by \\( A \\). Therefore, \\( y(T) \\) will depend on both \\( A \\) and \\( C \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The state \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will not strictly depend only on the matrix \\( A \\) because it includes the effect of the intervention matrix \\( C \\) at \\( t_1 \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
