    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\( h(z) = z^2 + pz + q \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The path is transformed by \\( g(z) = z + c \\).

However, the question asks if the integral depends solely on \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), ignoring this intervention.\n\n5. **Effect of the Intervention**:\n   - The intervention changes the function at a specific point but does not change the overall form of \\( h(z) \\) for most of the path.\n   - The integral is a linear operation, meaning it sums up the contributions of the function over the entire path. Any local changes (like the intervention) do not affect the overall integral unless they significantly alter the function over a substantial portion of the path.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the intervention only affects the function at a single point and does not fundamentally change the nature of \\( h(z) \\) over the entire path, the integral from \\( z_0 \\) to \\( z_1 \\) will still be determined primarily by the parameters \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) of the original function.\n\nTherefore, the integral from \\( z_0 \\) to \\( z_1 \\) solely depends on the original function's parameters \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), ignoring the intervention.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\( h(z) = z^2 + pz + q \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation is given by \\( g(z) = z + c \\). This shifts the function horizontally but does not change the form of \\( h(z) \\) itself.\n\n3. **Intervention**: At a midpoint of the path, the function is adjusted to \\( h(z) = (z - d)^2 + pz + q \\). This introduces a new term involving \\( d \\).\n\n4. **Integral Calculation**: We need to compare the integral from \\( z_0 \\) to \\( z_1 \\) for the original function and the function after the intervention.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n- **Original Integral**:\n  \\[\n  \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (z^2 + pz + q) \\, dz\n  \\]\n  This integral depends only on the parameters \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\n- **Adjusted Function**:\n  \\[\n  h(z) = (z - d)^2 + pz + q = z^2 - 2dz + d^2 + pz + q = z^2 + (p - 2d)z + (q + d^2)\n  \\]\n  The adjusted function has new coefficients \\( p' = p - 2d \\) and \\( q' = q + d^2 \\).\n\n- **Adjusted Integral**:\n  \\[\n  \\int_{z_0}^{z_1} (z^2 + (p - 2d)z + (q + d^2)) \\, dz\n  \\]\n  This integral depends on the parameters \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), as well as the new parameters \\( p' \\) and \\( q' \\).\n\nGiven that the intervention introduces new parameters \\( p' \\) and \\( q' \\) that depend on \\( d \\), the integral after the intervention will generally depend on these new parameters.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe integral from \\( z_0 \\) to \\( z_1 \\) does not solely depend on the original function's parameters \\( p \\) and \\( q \\); it also depends on the intervention parameter \\( d \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
