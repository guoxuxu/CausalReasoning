Without knowing the exact sequence of operations (i.e., whether \\( N \\) was applied before or after \\( M \\)), or any other intermediate states, we cannot uniquely determine the original matrices and their order.\n\nTherefore, based on the end state \\( z_T \\) alone, we cannot precisely determine which matrices were applied and in what order.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
