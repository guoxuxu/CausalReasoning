    "To determine if we can precisely infer the original initial condition \\( z_0 \\) from the observed transformed state \\( h(z(T)) \\), let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation Analysis**:\n   - The given differential equation is \\( \\frac{d}{dt} z(t) = Kz(t) \\).\n   - Since \\( K \\) is a diagonalizable matrix, there exists a basis where \\( K \\) is diagonal, simplifying the solution.\n   - The general solution to this differential equation is \\( z(t) = e^{Kt} z_0 \\), where \\( z_0 \\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Integral Transform Analysis**:\n   - The integral transform is defined as \\( h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{M(t-\\tau)}z(\\tau) d\\tau \\).\n   - Substituting \\( z(\\tau) = e^{K\\tau} z_0 \\) into the integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     h(z) = \\int_0^t e^{M(t-\\tau)} e^{K\\tau} z_0 d\\tau = z_0 \\int_0^t e^{M(t-\\tau) + K\\tau} d\\tau.\n     \\]\n   - This integral depends on both \\( M \\) and \\( K \\).
