    "To determine whether we can find the exact original value of \\(\\omega\\) by analyzing the resultant \\(Z(\\omega)\\) without any prior knowledge of \\(z(t)\\)'s modifications, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the given function and its Fourier Transform**:\n   - The function is \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\) is defined as \\(Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\(z(t)\\) into the Fourier Transform**:\n   - Substituting \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) into the Fourier transform formula, we get:\n     \\[\n     Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1 \\, dt.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   - The integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1 \\, dt\\) does not converge because it is the integral of a constant over an infinite interval, which diverges.\n\n4. **Interpret the Result**:\n   - Since the integral does not converge, the Fourier transform \\(Z(\\omega)\\) does not provide a finite result for any specific \\(\\omega\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the Fourier transform of \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) results in a non-convergent integral, there is no way to extract the exact value of \\(\\omega\\) from \\(Z(\\omega)\\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function and Transform**:\n   - The function \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) is a complex exponential function.\n   - The Fourier transform \\(Z(\\omega')\\) of \\(z(t)\\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     Z(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega' t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i(\\omega - \\omega')t} dt\n     \\]\n\n2. **Analyzing the Integral**:\n   - This integral is a standard Fourier transform of a complex exponential.\n   - If \\(\\omega = \\omega'\\), the integral evaluates to a Dirac delta function:\n     \\[\n     Z(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\n     \\]\n   - If \\(\\omega \\neq \\omega'\\), the integral does not converge in the usual sense and typically results in zero.\n\n3. **Implications for Determining \\(\\omega\\)**:\n   - From the above, if we know the form of \\(Z(\\omega)\\), we can directly identify \\(\\omega\\) because it will be a peak (or a Dirac delta function) at \\(\\omega = \\omega'\\).\n   - Without knowing \\(z(t)\\) or its modifications, we still have this property: the Fourier transform \\(Z(\\omega)\\) uniquely identifies \\(\\omega\\) when evaluated at \\(\\omega\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given \\(Z(\\omega)\\), we can indeed determine the exact value of \\(\\omega\\) by identifying the peak location in the Fourier domain, provided that no other modifications to \\(z(t)\\) have changed the fundamental nature of the transform.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
