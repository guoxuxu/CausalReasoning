If the system is allowed to evolve under \\(F = ma\\) without further intervention, the object will reach its final position at a different time compared to the original scenario.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The final position \\(x(T)\\) will generally not be the same because the time evolution of the system is different due to the change in acceleration.
