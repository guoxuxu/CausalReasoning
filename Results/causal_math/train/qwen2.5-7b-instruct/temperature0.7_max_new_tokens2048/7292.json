This means that without any external heating function \\(h(t)\\), the temperature change \\(\\Delta T(t)\\) would decrease exponentially over time.\n\n2. **Incorporating External Heating Function**:\n   The external heating function \\(h(t) = H e^{-kt}\\) introduces a term that adds heat to the system at a rate proportional to \\(e^{-kt}\\). This function starts strong and diminishes over time due to the exponential term.\n\n3. **Solving the Differential Equation with External Heating**:\n   To solve the full differential equation with the external heating function, we need to integrate the modified equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} + k\\Delta T = H e^{-kt}\n   \\]\n   This is a first-order linear differential equation. The integrating factor method can be used here. The integrating factor is \\(e^{kt}\\).\n\n4. **General Solution**:\n   Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor \\(e^{kt}\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{kt} \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} + k e^{kt} \\Delta T = H\n   \\]\n   The left-hand side is the derivative of the product \\(e^{kt} \\Delta T\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt} (e^{kt} \\Delta T) = H\n   \\]\n   Integrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   e^{kt} \\Delta T = Ht + C\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(\\Delta T(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T(t) = He^{-kt} + Ce^{-kt}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T(t) = He^{-kt} + Ce^{-kt}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T(t) = (H + C)e^{-kt}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Temperature**:\n   The final temperature \\(\\Delta T(T)\\) is obtained by evaluating \\(\\Delta T(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\):\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T(T) = (H + C)e^{-kT}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determining Interventions**:\n   Given only \\(\\Delta T(T)\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T(T) = (H + C)e^{-kT}\n   \\]\n   Without additional information about the initial conditions or other times, we cannot uniquely determine \\(H\\) (the magnitude of the heating function) and \\(C\\) (the integration constant).

However, the specific form of \\(h(t)\\) suggests that it is a decaying exponential function, similar to the natural decay term. This implies that \\(h(t)\\) is not adding or removing heat in a straightforward manner but rather influencing the rate of temperature change in a complex way.\n\n3. **Final Temperature Analysis**:\n   Given the final temperature \\(\\Delta T(T)\\) at time \\(T\\), we need to consider how this value relates to the original and modified systems. The modified system will have a different form due to the heating function, but ultimately, the temperature difference will still decay over time as described by the exponential term.\n\n4. **Determining Interventions**:\n   - If only the final temperature \\(\\Delta T(T)\\) is known, we cannot directly infer the nature of the interventions (heating, cooling, or both) because the exponential decay term \\(e^{-kT}\\) will be the same regardless of whether heating was applied.\n   - The heating function \\(h(t) = H e^{-kt}\\) does not provide a clear indication of past interventions once the system has reached its final state.
