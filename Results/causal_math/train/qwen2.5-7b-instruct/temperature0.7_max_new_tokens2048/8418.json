    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given system is a linear differential equation: \\(\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t)\\).\n\n2.

So, \\(x(T) = e^{MT}x_0\\).\n\n4. Now, consider the transformation \\(h(x) = S \\exp(i\\omega t)x\\). This transformation is applied to the solution, but it doesn't change the fact that the solution remains of the form \\(e^{Mt}x_0\\) after the transformation.\n\n5.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: The given system is described by the differential equation \\(\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) = Mx(t)\\).
