If \\( K(u) \\) was applied, the initial condition \\( u_0(x) \\) would be transformed to some other form.\n\nSince the application of the integral transform \\( K(u) \\) could change the initial condition in a way that isn't directly reversible from the final state alone, we cannot infer the exact initial condition \\( u_0(x) \\) without additional information about whether \\( K(u) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
