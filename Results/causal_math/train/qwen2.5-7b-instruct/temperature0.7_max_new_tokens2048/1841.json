This kernel has a smoothing effect and emphasizes values closer to the origin due to its bell-shaped curve.\n\n4. **Effect of Heat Diffusion on \\( T(u) \\)**: As \\( u(x, y) \\) evolves over time according to the heat equation, the function \\( u \\) becomes more spread out due to diffusion. This spreading would affect the integral \\( T(u) \\), especially since the Gaussian kernel \\( e^{-x^2-y^2} \\) gives more weight to central regions of the plane.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the heat diffusion process spreads the heat out over time, it is unlikely that \\( T(u) \\) at any later time \\( t = T \\) will be the same as \\( T(u) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).
