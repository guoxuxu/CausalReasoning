The spectrum alone does not provide enough information about the time-domain characteristics of \\(m(t)\\). \n\n6. **Conclusion**: While the central frequency \\(\\omega\\) can be directly inferred from the spectrum, the exact form of the modulation function \\(m(t)\\) cannot be determined solely from the transformed spectrum.
