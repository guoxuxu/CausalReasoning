Therefore, the integral simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz = \\int_C e^{az} b \\, d(g^{-1}(z)) = b \\int_C e^{az} dz\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determining the Original Path and Nature of \\( g \\)**: From the above, we see that if we know \\( C' \\) and the value of \\( b \\), we can determine the original path \\( C \\) up to a scaling factor \\( b \\). The nature of \\( g \\) (i.e., whether it is a translation, scaling, or rotation) can be deduced from the form of \\( g(z) \\).\n\nGiven all these points, we can conclude that with knowledge of \\( C' \\) and \\( g(z) \\), we can indeed determine the original path \\( C \\) and the nature of the transformation function \\( g \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**:\n   - We have a complex function \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\) where \\( a \\) is a complex constant.\n   - The integral in question is \\( \\int_C e^{az} dz \\).\n   - A transformation \\( g(z) = bz + c \\) is applied to \\( z \\), resulting in \\( \\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz \\).\n\n2. **Change of Variables**:\n   - To relate \\( \\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz \\) back to \\( \\int_C e^{az} dz \\), we need to use the change of variables formula for integrals.\n   - Let \\( w = g(z) = bz + c \\). Then \\( dw = b dz \\).\n\n3. **Transforming the Integral**:\n   - Substitute \\( w = g(z) \\) into the integral \\( \\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz = \\int_{C'} e^{a(bz + c)} dz\n     \\]\n   - Using the substitution \\( dw = b dz \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{C'} e^{a(bz + c)} dz = \\int_{C'} e^{abw + ac} \\frac{dw}{b}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{C'} e^{abw + ac} \\frac{dw}{b} = \\frac{1}{b} \\int_{C'} e^{abw} e^{ac} dw\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( e^{ac} \\) is a constant with respect to \\( w \\), it can be factored out of the integral:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{b} e^{ac} \\int_{C'} e^{abw} dw\n     \\]\n\n4. **Relating to Original Path**:\n   - The integral \\( \\int_{C'} e^{abw} dw \\) can be rewritten in terms of the original path \\( C \\) by noting that \\( w = g(z) \\) maps \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\).\n   - Thus, \\( \\int_{C'} e^{abw} dw = \\int_C e^{az} \\frac{dz}{b} \\).\n\n5. **Final Transformation**:\n   - Combining these results, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz = \\frac{1}{b} e^{ac} \\int_C e^{az} \\frac{dz}{b} = \\frac{1}{b^2} e^{ac} \\int_C e^{az} dz\n     \\]\n\n6. **Determining Original Path and Nature of Transformation**:\n   - From the above relation, we see that knowing \\( \\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz \\) allows us to determine \\( \\int_C e^{az} dz \\) up to a multiplicative factor \\( \\frac{1}{b^2} e^{ac} \\).\n   - This means we can determine the nature of the transformation \\( g(z) = bz + c \\) (i.e., the constants \\( b \\) and \\( c \\)), but not necessarily the exact path \\( C \\) without additional information.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can determine the nature of the transformation function \\( g \\), but not the exact original path \\( C \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Transformation**: The function \\( g(z) = bz + c \\) is a linear transformation of the complex variable \\( z \\). This transformation can be seen as a combination of scaling (by \\( b \\)) and translation (by \\( c \\)).\n\n2. **Effect on the Integral Path**: The integral \\( \\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz \\) is transformed into \\( \\int_C e^{az} dz \\) by the change of variables \\( g(z) \\).\n\n3. **Change of Variables**: To understand how the path \\( C' \\) transforms into \\( C \\), we need to consider the substitution \\( w = g(z) \\). Since \\( g(z) = bz + c \\), we have \\( dw = g'(z)dz = bdz \\). Therefore, \\( dz = \\frac{dw}{b} \\).\n\n4. **Rewriting the Integral**: Substituting \\( w = g(z) \\) and \\( dz = \\frac{dw}{b} \\) into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{C'} e^{a(g(z))} dz = \\int_{C'} e^{aw} \\frac{dw}{b} = \\frac{1}{b} \\int_{C'} e^{aw} dw.\n   \\]\n   This shows that the integral \\( \\int_{C'} e^{aw} dw \\) is equivalent to \\( \\int_C e^{az} dz \\) with \\( C \\) being the image of \\( C' \\) under the transformation \\( g(z) \\).\n\n5. **Determining the Original Path and Transformation**: From the above analysis, we see that the path \\( C \\) is the image of \\( C' \\) under the transformation \\( g(z) \\). However, without additional information about \\( C' \\) or the specific form of \\( g(z) \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( C \\) from \\( C' \\) alone.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we cannot definitively determine the original path \\( C \\) and the nature of the transformation function \\( g \\) solely based on the given information.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
