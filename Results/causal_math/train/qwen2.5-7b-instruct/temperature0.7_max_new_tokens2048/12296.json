    "To analyze this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **System Description**: The given system is described by \\( u(z) = \\int_0^\\infty h(t) x(z-t) dt \\). This is a convolution integral, indicating that the system is linear and time-invariant (LTI).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Property**: For LTI systems, the Fourier transform of the output \\( u(t) \\) is the product of the Fourier transform of the input \\( x(t) \\) and the Fourier transform of the impulse response \\( h(t) \\). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\omega) = \\hat{x}(\\omega) \\cdot \\hat{h}(\\omega)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Unit Step Function Input**: If the input \\( x(t) \\) is a unit step function, its Fourier transform \\( \\hat{x}(\\omega) \\) is known. Specifically, for the unit step function \\( u(t) \\) (where \\( u(t) = 1 \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\) and \\( u(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t < 0 \\)), the Fourier transform is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega + 1}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Impulse Response Fourier Transform**: Let's denote the Fourier transform of the impulse response \\( h(t) \\) as \\( \\hat{h}(\\omega) \\).\n\n5. **Applying Fourier Transform to Output**: According to the property of LTI systems mentioned in step 2, when the input \\( x(t) \\) is a unit step function, the Fourier transform of the output \\( u(t) \\) should indeed be:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(\\omega) = \\hat{x}(\\omega) \\cdot \\hat{h}(\\omega)\n   \\]\n\nGiven these steps and the properties of LTI systems, we can conclude that the Fourier transform of the output \\( \\hat{u}(\\omega) \\) will directly correspond to the Fourier transform of the input \\( \\hat{x}(\\omega) \\) multiplied by the Fourier transform of the impulse response \\( \\hat{h}(\\omega) \\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
