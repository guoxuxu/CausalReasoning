For \\( z = e^{i\\omega t} \\), the Fourier transform would be a Dirac delta function \\( F(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), where \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the frequency corresponding to the exponent in \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n3. **Phase Shift Intervention**: An additional phase shift intervention \\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\). This means that at \\( t = t_1 \\), the function \\( z \\) is multiplied by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\). So, after the phase shift, the function becomes \\( z' = e^{i\\theta}e^{i\\omega t} = e^{i(\\omega t + \\theta)} \\).\n\n4. **Response After Phase Shift**: Now, we need to consider the Fourier transform of the new function \\( z' = e^{i(\\omega t + \\theta)} \\). The Fourier transform of \\( e^{i(\\omega t + \\theta)} \\) with respect to \\( t \\) is also a Dirac delta function but shifted by \\( \\theta \\): \\( F'(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - (\\omega_0 + \\theta)) \\).\n\n5. **Dependence on \\( \\theta \\)**: Notice that the Fourier transform \\( F'(\\omega) \\) now depends on \\( \\theta \\) because the frequency component is shifted by \\( \\theta \\).\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega) \\) at any time \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend on \\( \\theta \\) due to the phase shift applied at \\( t_1 \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\( z = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega) \\) of \\( z \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1 \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This integral does not converge for the entire real line, but if we consider it over a finite interval, the Fourier transform would yield a Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega \\):\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the frequency corresponding to the initial function.\n\n3. **Phase Shift Intervention**: When a phase shift \\( g(z) = e^{i\\theta}z \\) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\), the function becomes:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = \n   \\begin{cases} \n   e^{i\\omega t} & \\text{for } t < t_1 \\\\\n   e^{i(\\omega + \\theta)t} & \\text{for } t \\geq t_1 \n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Fourier Transform After Phase Shift**: The Fourier transform of \\( z'(t) \\) can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   F'(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t_1} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt + \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega + \\theta)t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   F'(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t_1} 1 \\, dt + \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{i\\theta t} dt\n   \\]\n   The first term is not well-defined for the entire real line, but the second term gives:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{i\\theta t} dt = \\frac{e^{i\\theta t_1}}{i\\theta}\n   \\]\n   So, the Fourier transform after the phase shift is:\n   \\[\n   F'(\\omega) = \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) + \\frac{e^{i\\theta t_1}}{i\\theta} \\delta(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Fourier transform now includes a term dependent on \\( \\theta \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: For \\( T > t_1 \\), the Fourier transform \\( F'(\\omega) \\) will indeed include terms that depend on \\( \\theta \\), specifically the term involving \\( e^{i\\theta t_1} \\).\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) will still depend on \\( \\theta \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
