At \\( t = 0 \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   h(z_0) = z_0 \\cdot e^{Q \\cdot 0} = z_0\n   \\]\n   So, initially, \\( h(z_0) = z_0 \\).\n\n3. **Evolution Under Differential Equation**: Both \\( z(t) \\) and \\( h(z) \\) evolve according to the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz \\). This means that for any \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(z(t)) = Pz(t)\n   \\]\n   The general solution to this differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0)e^{Pt}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Transformation Evolution**: Now consider \\( h(z) = z \\cdot e^{Qt} \\). If we apply this transformation to \\( z(t) \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   h(z(t)) = z(t) \\cdot e^{Qt} = z(0)e^{Pt} \\cdot e^{Qt} = z(0)e^{(P+Q)t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparing States**:\n   - Without transformation, \\( z(t) \\) evolves to \\( z(T) = z(0)e^{PT} \\).\n   - With transformation, \\( h(z_0) \\) evolves to \\( h(z(T)) = z(0)e^{(P+Q)T} \\).\n\n6. **Final Comparison**: For the states to be the same at \\( t = T \\), we need:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = h(z(T))\n   \\]\n   Substituting the expressions we derived:\n   \\[\n   z(0)e^{PT} = z(0)e^{(P+Q)T}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   e^{PT} = e^{(P+Q)T}\n   \\]\n   Which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   e^{PT} = e^{PT}e^{QT}\n   \\]\n   For this to hold true, we must have:\n   \\[\n   e^{QT} = 1\n   \\]\n   This is only true if \\( QT = 2\\pi i k \\) for some integer \\( k \\). In general, this condition does not hold unless \\( Q \\) is specifically chosen such that \\( e^{QT} = 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, in general, the states will not be the same.
