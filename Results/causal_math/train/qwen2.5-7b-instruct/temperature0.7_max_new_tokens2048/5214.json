    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Given Function**: The function given is \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t)\\), where \\(u(t)\\) is the unit step function.

This result directly corresponds to the Laplace transform of the product of an exponential function and a step function.\n\n3. **General Form of Laplace Transforms**: For a general function \\(f(t)u(t)\\), its Laplace transform is \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)u(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t)e^{-st}dt\\). If \\(f(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\), then \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}u(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t}e^{-st}dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i\\omega)t}dt = \\frac{1}{s-i\\omega}\\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Laplace Transforms**: The Laplace transform is unique for each function (under certain conditions). However, the inverse process isn't always straightforward because multiple functions can have the same Laplace transform if they differ only on a set of measure zero (which is not the case here since \\(u(t)\\) introduces a clear discontinuity at \\(t=0\\)).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the specific form of the Laplace transform \\(\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\\), it uniquely corresponds to the function \\(e^{i\\omega t}u(t)\\) when considering the properties of the Laplace transform and the nature of the unit step function.\n\nTherefore, with the given Laplace transform and understanding of the properties involved, we can conclusively determine that the original function was indeed \\(e^{i\\omega t}u(t)\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
