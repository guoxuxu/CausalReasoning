  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( g(z) \\\\) modifies the initial value to \\\\( e^{iz_0} \\\\). So, \\\\( f(g(z_0)) = (e^{iz_0})^2 = e^{i2z_0} \\\\), which differs generally from \\\\( f(z_0) = z_0^2 \\\\) due to the exponential and trigonometric nature of the transformation, affecting the magnitude and phase.",

Since f(z) = z^2, applying f to g(z_0) means (e^(iz))^2 = e^(2iz), and this transformation is independent of the initial z_0 value, making f(g(z_0)) distinct from f(z_0) unless z_0 is specifically chosen such that e^(2iz) = z^2.",
