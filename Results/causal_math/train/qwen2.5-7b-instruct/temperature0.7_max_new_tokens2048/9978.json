    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We have \\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\), which maps real values of \\( x \\) to points on the unit circle in the complex plane.

Given \\( w = e^{i2x} \\), we want to solve for \\( x \\).\n\n6. **Inverse Mapping**: If \\( w = 1 \\) on the \\( w \\)-plane, then:\n   \\[\n   1 = e^{i2x}\n   \\]\n   This equation holds true for \\( 2x = 0, 2\\pi, 4\\pi, ... \\), so \\( x = 0, \\pi, 2\\pi, ... \\).\n\n7. **Ambiguity Check**: From the above, \\( x = \\pi \\) is one possible solution, but it is not unique. There could be other values like \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( x = 2\\pi \\) that also satisfy the equation when transformed back.\n\nTherefore, knowing only the point \\( w \\) at \\( x = \\pi \\) does not allow us to unambiguously determine the corresponding \\( x \\) on the \\( z \\)-plane without additional information.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
