Since \\( x(T) \\) is influenced by \\( J(x) \\) after \\( t_1 \\), the velocity will depend on the current value of \\( x(T) \\), which is affected by \\( J(x) \\). However, the constant \\( \\omega \\) remains unchanged, and the effect of \\( J(x) \\) is through \\( x(T) \\), not directly on \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - \\( v(T) \\) depends on \\( x(T) \\).\n   - \\( x(T) \\) can be influenced by \\( J(x) \\) after \\( t_1 \\).\n   - \\( \\omega \\) is a constant and does not change.\n   - \\( \\lambda \\) affects the integral transform \\( I(x) \\) but not the direct relationship \\( v = \\omega x \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the velocity \\( v(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend on \\( \\omega \\) and also on the current value of \\( x(T) \\), which can be influenced by \\( J(x) \\). However, it does not depend directly on \\( \\lambda \\) or the effects of \\( J(x) \\) in the sense that \\( \\lambda \\) and the intervention \\( J(x) \\) do not alter the fundamental relationship \\( v = \\omega x \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
