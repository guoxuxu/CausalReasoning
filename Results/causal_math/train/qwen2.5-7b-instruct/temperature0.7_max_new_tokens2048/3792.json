    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Given Function and Transformation**:\n   - The function \\( z(t) = e^{ct} \\), where \\( c \\) is a complex constant.\n   - The integral transform is defined as \\( F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\( z(t) \\) into the Integral**:\n   - Substitute \\( z(t) = e^{ct} \\) into the integral: \n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{ct} \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{(c-s)t} \\, dt\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   - The integral \\( \\int_0^\\infty e^{(c-s)t} \\, dt \\) converges if and only if the real part of \\( c-s \\) is negative (i.e., \\( \\text{Re}(c-s) < 0 \\)).\n   - If it converges, we can evaluate it as follows:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(c-s)t}}{c-s} \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{s-c}\n     \\]\n     provided \\( \\text{Re}(s-c) > 0 \\).\n\n4. **Interpretation of \\( F(s) \\)**:\n   - The output \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-c} \\) depends directly on the value of \\( c \\).\n   - Any change in \\( c \\) will result in a different \\( F(s) \\).\n\n5. **Determine Change in \\( c \\)**:\n   - Given two different values of \\( F(s) \\), say \\( F_1(s) \\) and \\( F_2(s) \\), we can infer that these correspond to different values of \\( c \\) because \\( F(s) \\) is uniquely determined by \\( c \\).\n   - Specifically, if \\( F_1(s) = \\frac{1}{s-c_1} \\) and \\( F_2(s) = \\frac{1}{s-c_2} \\), then \\( c_1 \\neq c_2 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based solely on the output data \\( F(s) \\), one can determine if there was an intervention that changed the parameter \\( c \\) during the transformation process.
