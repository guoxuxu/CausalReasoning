    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the heat conduction PDE \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\) with initial condition \\( u(x, 0) = \\phi(x) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform at Initial Time**: Applying the Fourier transform to both sides at \\( t = 0 \\) gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(s, 0) = \\mathcal{F}\\{\\phi(x)\\}\n   \\]\n   This represents the initial condition in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Change in Thermal Diffusivity**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the thermal diffusivity changes from \\( k \\) to \\( k' \\). This is an intervention that affects the dynamics of the system after \\( t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Post-Intervention Dynamics**: For \\( t > t_1 \\), the PDE becomes \\( u_t' = k' u_{xx}' \\). The solution to this PDE will be influenced by the new thermal diffusivity \\( k' \\).\n\n5. **Fourier Transform Post-Intervention**: Applying the Fourier transform to the post-intervention PDE gives:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(s, t) = e^{-k' s^2 (t - t_1)} \\hat{u}(s, t_1)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{u}(s, t_1) \\) is the Fourier transform of the solution at \\( t_1 \\), which itself depends on the original diffusivity \\( k \\).\n\n6. **Final State Analysis**: For \\( t > t_1 \\), the solution \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\) (where \\( T > t_1 \\)) will indeed depend on the new thermal diffusivity \\( k' \\) because it is used in the exponential term \\( e^{-k' s^2 (T - t_1)} \\).\n\nTherefore, the solution \\( \\hat{u}(s, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on the new \\( k' \\) and not solely on the original \\( k \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
