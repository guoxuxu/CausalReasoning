However, it can introduce additional frequency components or modify the trajectory.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   The core circular frequency of the particle's trajectory is determined by \\(\\omega\\). The term \\(F(t)\\) can affect the amplitude and phase of the circular motion but does not change the fundamental frequency.\n\nTherefore, the circular frequency of the particle's trajectory will primarily depend on \\(\\omega\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the circular frequency of the particle's trajectory purely depends on \\(\\omega\\), let's analyze the given differential equation and the nature of the solution.\n\nThe differential equation governing the motion of the particle is:\n\\[ \\dot{z} = -i\\omega z + F(t) \\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[ \\frac{dz}{dt} = -i\\omega z + F(t) \\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation. To solve it, we need to find both the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\n1. **Homogeneous Solution**:\n   The homogeneous part of the equation is:\n   \\[ \\frac{dz_h}{dt} = -i\\omega z_h \\]\n   This is a simple exponential solution:\n   \\[ z_h(t) = A e^{-i\\omega t} \\]\n   where \\(A\\) is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n2. **Particular Solution**:\n   For the particular solution, we assume a form that matches the structure of \\(F(t)\\). However, for simplicity, if we consider \\(F(t)\\) to be a driving force that does not significantly alter the fundamental frequency of oscillation (assuming it is small or periodic with a different frequency), the primary frequency of the trajectory will still be dominated by the term involving \\(\\omega\\).\n\n3. **General Solution**:\n   The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n   \\[ z(t) = z_h(t) + z_p(t) \\]\n   \\[ z(t) = A e^{-i\\omega t} + z_p(t) \\]\n\nGiven that the initial condition \\(z_0\\) is provided, the constant \\(A\\) can be determined from this initial condition. The term \\(z_p(t)\\) represents the effect of the external force \\(F(t)\\), but its presence does not fundamentally change the circular frequency of the main oscillatory behavior, which is driven by \\(-i\\omega z\\).\n\nTherefore, the circular frequency of the particle's trajectory will primarily depend on \\(\\omega\\), as the term \\(-i\\omega z\\) directly influences the oscillatory behavior at frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the circular frequency of the particle's trajectory depends solely on \\(\\omega\\), let's analyze the given differential equation step by step:\n\n1. **Given Differential Equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{z} = -i\\omega z + F(t)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Initial Condition**:\n   \\[\n   z(0) = z_0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Form of \\(z(t)\\)**:\n   Let's assume \\(z(t)\\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = p(t) + i q(t)\n   \\]\n   where \\(p(t)\\) and \\(q(t)\\) are real functions.\n\n4. **Differentiation of \\(z(t)\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{z}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(p(t) + i q(t)) = \\dot{p}(t) + i \\dot{q}(t)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute into the Differential Equation**:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{p}(t) + i \\dot{q}(t) = -i\\omega (p(t) + i q(t)) + F(t)\n   \\]\n   This can be separated into real and imaginary parts:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{p}(t) + i \\dot{q}(t) = -i\\omega p(t) + \\omega q(t) + F(t)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Separate Real and Imaginary Parts**:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{p}(t) = \\omega q(t) + \\text{Re}(F(t))\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\dot{q}(t) = -\\omega p(t) + \\text{Im}(F(t))\n   \\]\n\n7. **Circular Frequency Analysis**:\n   For the circular frequency to be purely dependent on \\(\\omega\\), the system should exhibit simple harmonic motion without additional influences from \\(F(t)\\). If \\(F(t) = 0\\), then the equations simplify to:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{p}(t) = \\omega q(t)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\dot{q}(t) = -\\omega p(t)\n   \\]\n\n8. **Solving the Simplified System**:\n   These are coupled linear differential equations that describe simple harmonic motion with angular frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\n9. **Conclusion**:\n   When \\(F(t) = 0\\), the solution to these equations will be circular motion with frequency \\(\\omega\\). However, if \\(F(t) \\neq 0\\), the presence of \\(F(t)\\) introduces additional terms that can affect the trajectory, potentially changing the frequency or shape of the motion.\n\nSince the presence of \\(F(t)\\) can influence the trajectory beyond just \\(\\omega\\), the circular frequency of the particle's trajectory will not necessarily depend solely on \\(\\omega\\) unless \\(F(t) = 0\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
