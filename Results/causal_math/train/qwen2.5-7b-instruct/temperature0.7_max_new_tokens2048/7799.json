In the Laplace domain, multiplying by \\( s \\) corresponds to differentiating the time-domain function \\( V(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   V'(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}(s \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(V)(s)) = \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Effect on Current**:\n   Substituting \\( V'(t) \\) into the original differential equation:\n   \\[\n   L \\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} + R \\frac{di}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C}i = \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}\n   \\]\n   Taking the Laplace transform again:\n   \\[\n   L(s^2 I(s) - sI(0) - I'(0)) + R(sI(s) - I(0)) + \\frac{1}{C}I(s) = sV(s)\n   \\]\n   Again, with zero initial conditions:\n   \\[\n   Ls^2 I(s) + RsI(s) + \\frac{1}{C}I(s) = sV(s)\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   I(s) = \\frac{sV(s)}{Ls^2 + Rs + \\frac{1}{C}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   Comparing the two expressions for \\( I(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   I(s) = \\frac{V(s)}{Ls^2 + Rs + \\frac{1}{C}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad I(s) = \\frac{sV(s)}{Ls^2 + Rs + \\frac{1}{C}}\n   \\]\n   We see that the denominator is the same, but the numerator is different.
