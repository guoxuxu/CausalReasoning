    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation and Initial Conditions**:\n   The differential equation governing the temperature change is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} = -k\\Delta T\n   \\]\n   This is a first-order linear differential equation with the solution:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T(t) = \\Delta T(0)e^{-kt}\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\Delta T(0)\\) is the initial temperature difference.\n\n2. **Effect of External Heating Function \\(h(t)\\)**:\n   The external heating function is given by:\n   \\[\n   h(t) = H e^{-kt}\n   \\]\n   This adds an external heat input to the system. The modified differential equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} + k\\Delta T = H e^{-kt}\n   \\]\n   To solve this, we use an integrating factor, which is \\(e^{kt}\\).
