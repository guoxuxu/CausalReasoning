    "To determine if we can reconstruct the exact form of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) from \\( Z(s) \\), let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Laplace Transform Definition**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s - i\\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluate the Integral**: This integral converges for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > \\text{Re}(\\omega) \\).
