When we apply the Laplace transform, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right\\} = sU(s) - u(0)\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{Lu\\} = L\\mathcal{L}\\{u\\} = LU(s)\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   sU(s) - u(0) = LU(s)\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(U(s)\\):\n   \\[\n   U(s) = \\frac{u(0)}{s - L}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Intervention at \\(t_1\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), an additional operator \\(M\\) is applied, changing the system to \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Mu\\) for \\(t > t_1\\). We need to determine if the Laplace transform of \\(u(t)\\) for \\(s > s_1\\) (where \\(s_1\\) is the Laplace variable corresponding to \\(t_1\\)) depends solely on \\(L\\) and not on \\(M\\).\n\n3. **Post-intervention System**: For \\(t > t_1\\), the system becomes \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Mu\\). Applying the Laplace transform again:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right\\} = sU(s) - u(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{Mu\\} = M\\mathcal{L}\\{u\\} = MU(s)\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   sU(s) - u(t_1) = MU(s)\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(U(s)\\):\n   \\[\n   U(s) = \\frac{u(t_1)}{s - M}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**: The key here is to understand that \\(u(t_1)\\) is the state of the system just after the intervention at \\(t_1\\). This state depends on the solution of the system from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = t_1\\), which itself depends on the operator \\(L\\). Therefore, \\(u(t_1)\\) is influenced by \\(L\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The resulting \\(U(s)\\) for \\(s > s_1\\) will indeed depend on both \\(L\\) and \\(M\\). Specifically, \\(u(t_1)\\) (the state just after the intervention) depends on the solution of the system under \\(L\\), and then the Laplace transform under \\(M\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
