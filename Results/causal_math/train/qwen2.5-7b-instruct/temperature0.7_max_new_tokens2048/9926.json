This integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-i\\omega)t} \\, dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-(s-i\\omega)t}}{-(s-i\\omega)} \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{s-i\\omega}\n   \\]\n   because \\(e^{-(s-i\\omega)t} \\to 0\\) as \\(t \\to \\infty\\) due to the positive real part of \\(s-i\\omega\\).\n\n4. **Compare the result with the given transformation result:**\n   We have shown that \\(T[e^{i\\omega t}] = \\frac{1}{s-i\\omega}\\), which matches the given transformation result.\n\n5. **Determine if \\(\\omega\\) can be uniquely determined:**\n   From the transformation result \\(\\frac{1}{s-i\\omega}\\), we see that \\(\\omega\\) is directly present in the denominator. However, the form of the result does not provide any additional constraints on \\(\\omega\\) beyond its presence in the denominator. Since \\(s\\) is a complex number with a positive real part, the value of \\(\\omega\\) can theoretically be any real number that maintains the form of the result. Without additional information about \\(s\\) or specific values from which \\(\\omega\\) could be inferred, \\(\\omega\\) cannot be uniquely determined solely from the transformation result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
