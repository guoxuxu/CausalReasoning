The integrating factor for this equation is \\(e^{-at}\\). Multiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor gives:\n\\[ e^{-at}z' - ae^{-at}z = 0 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-at}z) = 0 \\]\n\nIntegrating both sides from 0 to \\(t\\):\n\\[ e^{-at}z(t) - z(0) = 0 \\]\n\\[ z(t) = z_0 e^{at} \\]\n\nSo, the function \\(z(t)\\) directly evolved under \\(L\\) is:\n\\[ z(t) = z_0 e^{at} \\]\n\nAt \\(t = T\\), the function is:\n\\[ z(T) = z_0 e^{aT} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Transformation and Subsequent Evolution Under \\(L\\)\n\nFirst, apply the transformation \\(T\\) to \\(z_0\\) at \\(t=0\\):\n\\[ Tz_0 = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)a} z_0 ds \\]\n\nEvaluating this at \\(t=0\\):\n\\[ Tz_0 = \\int_0^0 e^{(0-s)a} z_0 ds = 0 \\]\n\nNow, let's denote the result of the transformation as \\(w(t)\\):\n\\[ w(t) = Tz_0 = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)a} z_0 ds \\]\n\nNext, we need to evolve \\(w(t)\\) under the operator \\(L\\):\n\\[ Lw = w' + aw \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(w(t)\\):\n\\[ w(t) = \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)a} z_0 ds \\]\n\nDifferentiating \\(w(t)\\) with respect to \\(t\\):\n\\[ w'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)a} z_0 ds \\right) = e^{ta} z_0 \\]\n\nThus, the evolution equation for \\(w(t)\\) becomes:\n\\[ Lw = e^{ta} z_0 + a \\left( \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)a} z_0 ds \\right) \\]\n\nNotice that:\n\\[ \\int_0^t e^{(t-s)a} z_0 ds = w(t) \\]\n\nSo:\n\\[ Lw = e^{ta} z_0 + a w(t) \\]\n\nThis matches the original differential equation for \\(z(t)\\). Therefore, \\(w(t)\\) satisfies the same differential equation as \\(z(t)\\).\n\nAt \\(t = T\\), the function \\(w(T)\\) will be:\n\\[ w(T) = z_0 e^{aT} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth processes yield the same function at \\(t = T\\):\n- Direct evolution: \\( z(T) = z_0 e^{aT} \\)\n- Transformation followed by evolution: \\( w(T) = z_0 e^{aT} \\)\n\nThus, the function \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\) will indeed be the same in both cases.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
