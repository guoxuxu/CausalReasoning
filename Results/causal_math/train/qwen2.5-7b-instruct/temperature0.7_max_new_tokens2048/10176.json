Instead, the correct form should be:\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - \\omega)t} dt = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\delta\\) is the Dirac delta function. This indicates that the Fourier transform of \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\) is a single impulse at \\(\\omega\\).\n\n3. **Damping Intervention**: If a damping factor is introduced, the function becomes \\(z(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} e^{i\\omega t} = e^{-(\\alpha - i\\omega)t}\\), where \\(\\alpha > 0\\) is the damping coefficient. The Fourier transform of this damped function is:\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(\\alpha - i\\omega)t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\alpha t} e^{-2i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges and its result is:\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha + i(2\\omega)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Analyzing the Peak Shift**: When a damping factor is present, the peak of the Fourier transform will no longer be at \\(\\omega\\), but will be shifted and attenuated. The peak shift is due to the presence of the damping factor, which changes the frequency response of the system.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the Fourier transform output after applying a damping intervention, we can determine that the peak shift was indeed due to the introduction of a damping factor. Without a damping factor, the peak would remain at \\(\\omega\\). Therefore, if the peak is observed to have shifted, it indicates the presence of a damping factor.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
