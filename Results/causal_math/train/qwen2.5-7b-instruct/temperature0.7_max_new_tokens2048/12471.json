If we assume that the transformations are applied sequentially, then:\n   \\[\n   V(s) = s \\left( Z(s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s-a} \\right) = sZ(s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s-a}\n   \\]\n   This matches the given form \\( V(s) = sZ(s) \\frac{1}{s-a} \\).\n\n5. **Identifying Transformations**: Based on the expression for \\( V(s) \\), it is clear that both transformations \\( H(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\) (which is effectively represented by multiplication by \\( s \\)) were applied to \\( Z(s) \\). The order of application does not change the fact that both transformations were indeed applied.\n\nTherefore, by observing \\( V(s) \\), we can definitely state that both transformations (H(s) and G(s)) were applied on \\( Z(s) \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with \\( Z(s) \\), the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\).\n2. **Transformation by \\( H(s) \\)**: The function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) is given, which represents an integral operator.\n3. **Resulting Function**: The resulting function after applying \\( H(s) \\) to \\( Z(s) \\) is \\( V(s) = sZ(s)\\frac{1}{s-a} \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze if we can definitively determine which transformations were applied based on \\( V(s) \\):\n\n- **Applying \\( H(s) \\) to \\( Z(s) \\)**:\n  - The transformation \\( V(s) = sZ(s)\\frac{1}{s-a} \\) involves multiplying \\( Z(s) \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) and then multiplying the result by \\( s \\).\n  - This operation is equivalent to applying \\( H(s) \\) to \\( Z(s) \\) followed by a multiplication by \\( s \\).\n\n- **Identifying Transformations**:\n  - To determine if we can definitively identify which transformations were applied, we need to consider if there are other possible transformations that could lead to the same \\( V(s) \\).\n  - However, since \\( V(s) \\) is explicitly given as the result of applying \\( H(s) \\) to \\( Z(s) \\) and then multiplying by \\( s \\), there is no ambiguity about the application of \\( H(s) \\).\n  - The term \\( s \\) is a standard part of the inverse Laplace transform process when dealing with derivatives in the time domain.\n\nGiven the explicit form of \\( V(s) \\), it is clear that the transformation \\( H(s) \\) was applied to \\( Z(s) \\) and then multiplied by \\( s \\). There is no other transformation mentioned or implied in the given information.\n\nTherefore, we can definitively state that \\( H(s) \\) was applied to \\( Z(s) \\) to obtain \\( V(s) \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Transform**: We start with \\( Z(s) \\), the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( H(s) \\)**: The function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) is given as an integral operator. When we multiply \\( Z(s) \\) by \\( H(s) \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   W(s) = Z(s)H(s) = Z(s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s-a}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Further Transformation**: We are also given \\( V(s) = sW(s) \\). Substituting \\( W(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   V(s) = s \\left( Z(s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s-a} \\right) = sZ(s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s-a}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Identifying the Transformations**:\n   - **Multiplication by \\( H(s) \\)**: This transformation is clearly visible in \\( W(s) \\).\n   - **Multiplication by \\( s \\)**: This is evident in the expression for \\( V(s) \\).\n\n5. **Inference from \\( V(s) \\)**: To determine if we can definitively state which transformations were applied just by observing \\( V(s) \\):\n   - The form \\( V(s) = sZ(s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) suggests that both transformations have been applied.\n   - However, without additional information about the original \\( Z(s) \\) or the specific form of \\( V(s) \\), it is not possible to uniquely identify whether each transformation was applied separately or in sequence.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the provided information, we cannot definitively state which transformations (either \\( H(s) \\), \\( G(s) \\), or both) were applied on \\( Z(s) \\) just by observing \\( V(s) \\). The observed form could be due to a single sequence of transformations or multiple transformations applied in different orders.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
