    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function and Path**: \n   - The function given is \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\), where \\( a \\) is a complex constant.\n   - We're considering the integral \\( \\int_C e^{az} dz \\) over some path \\( C \\) in the complex plane.\n   - A deformation \\( D \\) of path \\( C \\) leads to a new path \\( C' \\).\n\n2. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**:\n   - For a function to be integrable over a closed path in the complex plane, it must be analytic (holomorphic) within and on that path.\n   - If \\( f(z) = e^{az} \\) is analytic everywhere in the complex plane (which it is, since exponentials are entire functions), then Cauchy's Integral Theorem applies.\n   - Cauchy's Integral Theorem states that the integral of an analytic function over any closed path in a simply connected domain is zero.\n\n3. **Deformation of Paths**:\n   - If the deformation \\( D \\) does not cross any singularities and remains within the same simply connected domain, the integral value should remain unchanged.\n   - This is because the theorem guarantees that the integral around any closed loop is zero for analytic functions.\n\n4. **Effect of Deformation**:\n   - If \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\) are homotopic (can be continuously deformed into each other without leaving the region where \\( f(z) \\) is analytic), then the integral values are the same.\n   - Since \\( e^{az} \\) is analytic everywhere, any deformation \\( D \\) of \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\) will keep the integral value the same if \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\) are homotopic within the domain of analyticity.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that \\( e^{az} \\) is analytic everywhere in the complex plane, the integral \\( \\int_C e^{az} dz \\) will indeed remain unchanged under a deformation \\( D \\) to a new path \\( C' \\), provided \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\) are homotopic.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

This is an entire function (holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane).\n\n2. **Path Independence**: For a holomorphic function, the integral over any closed path is zero due to Cauchy's Integral Theorem. However, for a general path, the integral can depend on the path taken, but it does not change if the path is continuously deformed without crossing singularities. Since \\( e^{az} \\) has no singularities in the complex plane, the integral over any path depends only on the endpoints of the path, not on the path itself.\n\n3. **Deformation of Path**: If we deform the path \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\) continuously without crossing any singularities, the integral value should remain the same because the function \\( e^{az} \\) is holomorphic (analytic) everywhere in the complex plane. This means that the integral is path-independent.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that \\( e^{az} \\) is an entire function, the integral of \\( e^{az} \\) over any path in the complex plane depends only on the endpoints of the path, and continuous deformation of the path does not change the value of the integral.\n\nTherefore, the integral value \\( \\int_{C'} e^{az} dz \\) will remain unchanged from the original \\( \\int_C e^{az} dz \\) under a continuous deformation of the path.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",

    "To determine if the integral value remains unchanged under a deformation of the path \\(C\\) to \\(C'\\), we need to consider the properties of the integrand \\(e^{az}\\) and the conditions under which such deformations are valid.\n\n1. **Identify the Integrand**: The integrand here is \\(e^{az}\\), where \\(a\\) is a complex constant. This is an entire function (holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane).\n\n2. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**: For a function that is holomorphic in a simply connected domain, Cauchy's Integral Theorem states that the integral of the function over any closed curve in that domain is zero. More generally, for a function that is holomorphic in a domain and a path that lies within that domain, the integral is independent of the specific path between two points, provided the endpoints are the same.\n\n3. **Application to the Problem**: Since \\(e^{az}\\) is entire (holomorphic everywhere in the complex plane), it satisfies the conditions of Cauchy's Integral Theorem. Therefore, the integral \\(\\int_C e^{az} dz\\) is path-independent as long as the endpoints of the path \\(C\\) are not changed during the deformation to \\(C'\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: If the deformation \\(D\\) does not pass through any singularities of the integrand (which \\(e^{az}\\) does not have since it is entire) and the endpoints of the path remain the same, then the integral value \\(\\int_{C'} e^{az} dz\\) will indeed remain unchanged from the original \\(\\int_C e^{az} dz\\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
