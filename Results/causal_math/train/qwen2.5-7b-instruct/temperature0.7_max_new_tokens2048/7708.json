However, this only tells us about the transformed function, not the original function \\( u \\).\n\n4. **Inverse Transformation**: To determine if we can uniquely identify the transformations, we need to consider whether there could be other transformations that would yield the same endpoint value \\( u(T, x) \\).\n\n5. **Consider Other Transformations**: Suppose there was another transformation \\( S(u) \\) such that \\( S(u) = u e^{imx} \\) for some different \\( m \\).
