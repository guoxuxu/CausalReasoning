  "Explanation": "Applying the Laplace transform alters the domain from time to frequency, changing the nature of relationships and dependencies in the system. If transformed back to time domain after evolution, the influence of the original equations on the mapping from frequency back to time will not exactly retain the effects visible in the original untransformed system.",
