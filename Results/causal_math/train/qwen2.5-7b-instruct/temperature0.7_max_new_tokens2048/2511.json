The combined effect of these functions needs to be considered.\n\n4. **Laplace Transform of Combined System**: The Laplace transform of the combined system would ideally be the sum of the individual transforms, i.e., \\( F(s) + G(s) \\).

    "Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with a linear system described by differential equations.
