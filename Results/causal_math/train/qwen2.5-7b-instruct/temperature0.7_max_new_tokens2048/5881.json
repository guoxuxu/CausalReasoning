  "Problem": "Consider the complex function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\), representing a circular path in the complex plane at a fixed radius of 1, where \\\\( \\omega \\\\) is the angular frequency. We examine the change in trajectory when this function is altered with a transformation \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) at time t.\n\nIf the initial function \\\\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\\\) is squared at t = 0, and then it evolves with the same \\\\( \\omega \\\\) for time T without further modification, will the function at t = T differ from that obtained by not squaring initially and evolving for time T?",
  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "Squaring the function changes the frequency from \\\\( \\omega \\\\) to \\\\( 2\\omega \\\\) because \\\\( (e^{i\\omega t})^2 = e^{2i\\omega t} \\\\). This changes the speed at which the function traverses the circular path, influencing its position at any later time T compared to unsquared evolution.",
  "causal_map": "z(0) → z(0)^2; z(0)^2 → z(T); z(0) → z(T)",
  "causal_map_integration": "The initial function z(0) directly influences both z(0)^2 and z(T). Squaring z(0) at t=0 leads to z(0)^2, which then evolves over time T to become z(T). Alternatively, z(0) evolves directly to z(T) without squaring.",
