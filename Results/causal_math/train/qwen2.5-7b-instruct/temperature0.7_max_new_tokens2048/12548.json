For the wave equation with the specified initial conditions, the solution can be expressed using d'Alembert's formula or separation of variables.

This means that if there are multiple sources of disturbances (in this case, the initial displacement and initial velocity), the total solution is the sum of the individual solutions due to each source.\n\n7. Given that the initial velocity is zero, the only source of disturbance at \\( t = 0 \\) is the initial displacement \\( h(x) \\).\n\n8.

Even if the initial velocity is zero, the form of the solution still involves both the initial displacement and its spatial derivatives.\n\n5. **Specific form of the solution**: For a one-dimensional wave equation, the solution can be written as:\n   \\[\n   u(x, t) = \\frac{1}{2} [h(x + ct) + h(x - ct)]\n   \\]\n   In higher dimensions, the solution involves more complex forms involving spherical harmonics and radial functions, but the principle remains that the solution depends on both the initial displacement and its spatial derivatives.\n\nGiven the above points, we can conclude that while the initial displacement \\( h(x) \\) plays a crucial role in determining the displacement \\( u(x, t) \\) at a later time \\( t = T \\), the solution also depends on the initial velocities. Therefore, the displacement \\( u(x, t) \\) at a later time \\( t = T \\) cannot be purely dependent on \\( h(x) \\) and independent of any initial velocities.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To determine whether the displacement \\( u(x, t) \\) at a later time \\( t = T \\) is purely dependent on the initial displacement \\( h(x) \\) and independent of any initial velocities, let's reason through the given problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Equation Analysis**:\n   The governing equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation (PDE):\n   \\[\n   u_{tt} = c^2 \\Delta u\n   \\]\n   This is known as the wave equation, which describes how waves propagate through space and time.\n\n2. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - Initial displacement: \\( u(x, 0) = h(x) \\)\n   - Initial velocity: \\( u_t(x, 0) = 0 \\) (implying no initial velocity).\n\n3. **Wave Equation Characteristics**:\n   The wave equation is linear, and solutions can be constructed using the principle of superposition. For the given initial conditions, the solution can be expressed as a sum of two parts:\n   - One part depends only on the initial displacement \\( h(x) \\).\n   - Another part depends on the initial velocity \\( u_t(x, 0) \\).\n\n4. **Solution Formulation**:\n   Given the initial conditions \\( u(x, 0) = h(x) \\) and \\( u_t(x, 0) = 0 \\), the general solution for the wave equation can be written as:\n   \\[\n   u(x, t) = \\frac{1}{2} [h(x + ct) + h(x - ct)]\n   \\]\n   This form shows that the solution is solely dependent on the initial displacement \\( h(x) \\) and does not include any terms involving the initial velocity.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Since the initial velocity \\( u_t(x, 0) \\) is zero, it does not contribute to the solution at any later time \\( t \\). Therefore, the displacement \\( u(x, t) \\) at a later time \\( t = T \\) is purely dependent on the initial displacement \\( h(x) \\) and independent of any initial velocities.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
