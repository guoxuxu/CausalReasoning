The Laplace transform of \\( u(t) \\) is denoted as \\( U(s) \\).\n\n6. **Applying the Laplace Transform**: When we apply the Laplace transform to the PDE, assuming zero initial conditions for \\( u \\) and its derivatives, the transformed PDE becomes:\n   \\[\n   sU(s) - u(x, 0) = L[U(s)]\n   \\]\n   Given that \\( u(x, 0) = 0 \\), this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   sU(s) = L[U(s)]\n   \\]\n\n7. **Incorporating the Input Function**: The input function \\( g(x, t) \\) can be considered in the form of an impulse response or forcing function. For simplicity, if we consider the system being driven by \\( g(x, t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), then the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is \\( G(s) \\). \n\n8. **Final Form of \\( U(s) \\)**: The transformed system state \\( U(s) \\) will depend on the Laplace transform of the initial condition and the input. Since the system is initially at rest and only \\( g(x, t) \\) is applied at \\( t = 0 \\), the solution in the Laplace domain can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\} = \\frac{G(s)}{s + L}\n   \\]\n\nGiven this analysis, the transformed system state \\( U(s) \\) is indeed a function of the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) (denoted as \\( G(s) \\)) and the operator \\( L \\) (which appears in the denominator due to the initial condition being zero).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}, because \\( U(s) \\) is not just a function of the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\); it also includes the operator \\( L \\) in the denominator.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

This input affects the system's state \\(u(x, t)\\).\n\n4. **Evolution Without Further Input**: After the initial application of \\(g(x, t)\\) at \\(t = 0\\), no further input is applied. The system evolves according to \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\).\n\n5. **Laplace Transform**: To analyze the system, we apply the Laplace transform with respect to time \\(t\\). Let \\(U(s, x)\\) denote the Laplace transform of \\(u(x, t)\\) and \\(G(s, x)\\) denote the Laplace transform of \\(g(x, t)\\).\n\n6. **Transformed Equation**: Applying the Laplace transform to the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   sU(s, x) - u(x, 0) = LU(s, x)\n   \\]\n   Given that \\(u(x, 0) = 0\\), this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   sU(s, x) = LU(s, x)\n   \\]\n\n7. **Initial Condition Impact**: Since the system was initially at rest (\\(u(x, 0) = 0\\)), the Laplace transform of the initial condition does not contribute to \\(U(s, x)\\).\n\n8. **Effect of Input**: The input \\(g(x, t)\\) is applied only at \\(t = 0\\). Therefore, its effect on the system is captured in the Laplace domain by the term \\(G(s, x)\\).\n\n9. **Final State**: For \\(t > 0\\), the system evolves independently of any further inputs. Thus, the state \\(U(s, x)\\) is determined solely by the initial input \\(G(s, x)\\).\n\nTherefore, the transformed system state \\(U(s, x)\\) will indeed be a function of the Laplace transform of \\(g(t)\\) alone.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\": \"Yes\"}",
