    "To determine if the outcome of the integral \\(\\int_C g(f(h(z))) dz\\) depends solely on \\(f(z)\\) and not on \\(g(z)\\) or \\(h(z)\\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Functions and Transformations:**\n   - \\(f(z) = e^z\\)\n   - \\(g(z) = \\sin(z)\\)\n   - \\(h(z) = \\log(z)\\)\n\n2. **Understand the Composition:**\n   - The composition \\(g(f(h(z)))\\) means first applying \\(h(z)\\), then \\(f(z)\\), and finally \\(g(z)\\).\n   - So, \\(g(f(h(z))) = g(e^{\\log(z)})\\).\n\n3. **Simplify the Composition:**\n   - Since \\(e^{\\log(z)} = z\\) for \\(z \\neq 0\\), the expression simplifies to \\(g(z) = \\sin(z)\\).\n\n4. **Analyze the Integral:**\n   - The integral becomes \\(\\int_C \\sin(z) dz\\).\n\n5. **Determine Dependence:**\n   - The integral \\(\\int_C \\sin(z) dz\\) is dependent on the path \\(C\\) in the complex plane.\n   - However, the integrand \\(\\sin(z)\\) is derived from the compositions of \\(g(z)\\) and \\(f(z)\\) through \\(h(z)\\), but the final form of the integrand is just \\(\\sin(z)\\), which does not directly depend on \\(h(z)\\) anymore after simplification.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - While the original functions \\(g(z)\\) and \\(h(z)\\) play roles in the transformation process, the final integrand \\(\\sin(z)\\) does not depend on \\(h(z)\\) once simplified. The integral \\(\\int_C \\sin(z) dz\\) is determined by the path \\(C\\) and the properties of \\(\\sin(z)\\), which are influenced by \\(f(z)\\) and \\(g(z)\\) but not directly by \\(h(z)\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the outcome of the integral \\(\\int_C g(f(h(z))) dz\\) does indeed depend on \\(f(z)\\) and not on \\(g(z)\\) or \\(h(z)\\) in the final form.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the outcome of the integral \\(\\int_C g(f(h(z))) dz\\) depends solely on \\(f(z)\\) and not on \\(g(z)\\) or \\(h(z)\\), let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Define the Functions**:\n   - \\(f(z) = e^z\\)\n   - \\(g(z) = \\sin(z)\\)\n   - \\(h(z) = \\log(z)\\)\n\n2. **Substitute \\(h(z)\\) into \\(f(z)\\)**:\n   - \\(f(h(z)) = e^{\\log(z)} = z\\) (for \\(z \\neq 0\\))\n\n3. **Substitute \\(f(h(z))\\) into \\(g(z)\\)**:\n   - \\(g(f(h(z))) = g(z) = \\sin(z)\\)\n\n4. **Integral Consideration**:\n   - The integral we are considering is \\(\\int_C g(f(h(z))) dz\\).\n   - From the previous steps, we know that \\(g(f(h(z))) = \\sin(z)\\).\n\n5. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   - Therefore, the integral simplifies to \\(\\int_C \\sin(z) dz\\).\n\n6. **Dependence Analysis**:\n   - The integral \\(\\int_C \\sin(z) dz\\) depends on the path \\(C\\) in the complex plane.\n   - However, the expression inside the integral, \\(\\sin(z)\\), is solely dependent on \\(z\\), which is transformed by \\(h(z)\\) and then passed through \\(g(f(z))\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The integral \\(\\int_C \\sin(z) dz\\) does not directly depend on \\(f(z)\\) or \\(g(z)\\) in the sense that it is the result of applying \\(g(f(h(z)))\\), but rather it is the result of applying \\(g(z)\\) after transforming \\(z\\) via \\(h(z)\\) and then \\(f(z)\\).\n   - Since the integral itself is based on \\(\\sin(z)\\), and \\(\\sin(z)\\) is the result of the chain of transformations, the dependency is on the final form of the integrand, which is \\(\\sin(z)\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the outcome of the integral \\(\\int_C g(f(h(z))) dz\\) does indeed depend on the transformations applied, but it simplifies to a form where the dependency is on \\(\\sin(z)\\), which is the final form after all transformations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
