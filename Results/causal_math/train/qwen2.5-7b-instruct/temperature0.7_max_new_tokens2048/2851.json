When solving the heat equation with this initial condition, the solution remains Gaussian but its parameters evolve over time.\n    - The intervention at \\(t_1\\) introduces a spatially varying exponential decay. However, this does not change the fundamental nature of the diffusion process described by the heat equation. The diffusion coefficient \\(k\\) still governs how quickly the temperature spreads out over time.\n    - The constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) affect the initial and cooling conditions respectively, but they do not alter the long-term behavior governed by \\(k\\). The cooling effect at \\(t_1\\) modifies the temperature profile at that specific time but does not fundamentally change the diffusion process.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: While the constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) play roles in the initial and intervention conditions, the temperature profile \\(u(x,T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will still be governed by the diffusion coefficient \\(k\\).
