This means that after \\( t_1 \\), the new function becomes \\( z'(t) = z(t) + h(t) \\).\n\n3. **Effect of the Differential Operator:**\n   - The differential operator \\( D = \\frac{d}{dt} \\) affects \\( z(t) \\) in the time domain.\n   - However, the problem does not specify how \\( h(t) \\) is affected by \\( D \\). For simplicity, let's assume \\( h(t) \\) is not directly acted upon by \\( D \\) in the context of the Fourier Transform.\n\n4. **Fourier Transform Properties:**\n   - The Fourier Transform is a linear operation. If two functions \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) are transformed, then \\( F(f + g) = F(f) + F(g) \\).\n   - Therefore, if we consider the intervention at \\( t_1 \\) as a point-wise addition (not affecting the linearity of the Fourier Transform over the entire domain), the Fourier Transform of the combined function should ideally be the sum of the Fourier Transforms of the individual functions.\n\n5. **Final Fourier Transform Analysis:**\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( z'(t) = z(t) + h(t) \\) would be \\( F(z')(ω) \\).\n   - According to the linearity property of the Fourier Transform, \\( F(z'(t)) = F(z(t) + h(t)) = F(z(t)) + F(h(t)) \\).\n\nGiven these steps, the final Fourier Transform \\( F(z'(t)) \\) should indeed be the sum of the Fourier Transforms of \\( z(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Signal and Its Fourier Transform:**\n   - We start with a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\).\n\n2. **Intervention:**\n   - An additional function \\( h(t) \\) is added to \\( z(t) \\) at a specific time \\( t_1 \\). This means that after \\( t_1 \\), the new signal becomes \\( z'(t) = z(t) + h(t) \\).\n\n3. **Differential Operator:**\n   - The differential operator \\( D = \\frac{d}{dt} \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\). This results in \\( \\frac{dz(t)}{dt} \\).\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of the New Signal:**\n   - The Fourier transform of the new signal \\( z'(t) \\) is \\( F(z')(ω) \\).\n\n5. **Linearity of Fourier Transform:**\n   - The Fourier transform is a linear operation. This means that for any two functions \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\), and constants \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n     \\[\n     F(a f(t) + b g(t)) = a F(f)(\\omega) + b F(g)(\\omega)\n     \\]\n   - Applying this property to our case:\n     \\[\n     F(z'(t)) = F(z(t) + h(t)) = F(z(t)) + F(h(t))\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the Fourier transform of the new signal \\( z'(t) \\) (which is \\( z(t) + h(t) \\)) is indeed the sum of the Fourier transforms of \\( z(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
