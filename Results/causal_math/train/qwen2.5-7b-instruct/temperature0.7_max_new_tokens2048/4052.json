The form of \\( modified_U(s) \\) does not provide direct information about \\( s' \\) without additional context or constraints.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the transformed function \\( modified_U(s) \\), we cannot precisely deduce if \\( e^{st} \\) was the modification applied.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**: The given differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2u}{dt^2} + 2\\frac{du}{dt} + 5u = 0\n   \\]\n   Taking the Laplace transform of both sides, assuming zero initial conditions, we get:\n   \\[\n   s^2U(s) + 2sU(s) + 5U(s) = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we find:\n   \\[\n   U(s)(s^2 + 2s + 5) = 0\n   \\]\n   Since \\(U(s) \\neq 0\\) (assuming non-trivial solutions), we have:\n   \\[\n   U(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 2s + 5}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Intervention with \\(e^{st}\\)**: Introducing \\(e^{st}\\) to the solution \\(u(t)\\) modifies the function to \\(modified\\_u(t) = u(t)e^{st}\\). Taking the Laplace transform of \\(modified\\_u(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   modified\\_U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)e^{st}\\} = U(s+s)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(U(s)\\) from above:\n   \\[\n   modified\\_U(s) = \\frac{1}{(s+s)^2 + 2(s+s) + 5} = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 4s + 5}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Deduction of Modification**: To determine if the modification \\(e^{st}\\) was applied based solely on \\(modified\\_U(s)\\), we need to check if \\(modified\\_U(s)\\) uniquely corresponds to the introduction of \\(e^{st}\\).\n\n   - If we observe \\(modified\\_U(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 4s + 5}\\), we see that it does not directly reveal the presence of \\(e^{st}\\) without knowing the original form of \\(U(s)\\).\n   - However, knowing \\(U(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 2s + 5}\\), the modification \\(e^{st}\\) clearly changes the denominator to \\(s^2 + 4s + 5\\), which is unique to the introduction of \\(e^{st}\\).\n\nSince the transformation \\(modified\\_U(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 4s + 5}\\) is a direct result of multiplying \\(u(t)\\) by \\(e^{st}\\), and there are no other common transformations that would yield this specific form, we can deduce that \\(e^{st}\\) was indeed the modification applied.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
