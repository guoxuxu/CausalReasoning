  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( f(z) = e^{i\\\\omega t}z \\\\) modifies the initial condition and adds a frequency-based rotation, causing the trajectory in the complex plane to differ from that of just evolving under \\\\( \\\\frac{dz}{dt} = -iz \\\\), which typically represents a simple rotational dynamic without scaling.",

Directly evolving z_0 according to dz/dt = -iz from t=0 to t=T also results in z(T). Therefore, z(T) after applying f(z) and evolving or directly evolving z_0 to t=T under the given dynamics are equivalent.",
