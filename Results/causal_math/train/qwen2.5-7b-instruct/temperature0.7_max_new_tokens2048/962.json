    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: The system is described by a Laplace transform \\( Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}(s) \\), which means \\( Y(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of the time-domain signal \\( y(t) \\).\n\n2. **Transfer Function**: The transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s-p} \\) is introduced to modify \\( Y(s) \\).

Specifically, the inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s-p} \\) is \\( e^{pt} \\). Therefore, multiplying \\( Y(s) \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{s-p} \\) in the Laplace domain is equivalent to convolving \\( y(t) \\) with \\( e^{pt} \\) in the time domain.\n\n5. **Recovering \\( y(t) \\)**: To recover \\( y(t) \\) from \\( y'(t) \\), we would need additional information such as the exact form of \\( H(s) \\) or specific knowledge about the nature of \\( y(t) \\) and \\( y'(t) \\).

This implies:\n   \\[\n   Y_H(s) = \\frac{1}{s - p} Y(s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Effect of Transfer Function**: Multiplying \\( Y(s) \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{s - p} \\) in the Laplace domain corresponds to a time-domain operation involving differentiation with respect to \\( t \\).
