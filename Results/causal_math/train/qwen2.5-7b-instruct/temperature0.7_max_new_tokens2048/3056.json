    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transition Rate Matrix**:\n   The given transition rate matrix \\(Q\\) describes a two-state continuous-time Markov chain:\n   \\[\n   Q = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\lambda & \\lambda \\\\ \\mu & -\\mu \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(\\lambda\\) is the rate at which state 1 transitions to state 2, and \\(\\mu\\) is the rate at which state 2 transitions to state 1.\n\n2. **Effect of Scaling Functions**:\n   The scaling functions \\(f(t) = e^{\\alpha t}\\) and \\(g(t)\\) modify the transition rates. If both functions are applied, the modified transition rates would be:\n   \\[\n   Q' = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\lambda e^{\\alpha t} & \\lambda e^{\\alpha t} \\\\ \\mu g(t) & -\\mu g(t) \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n   However, since we only know \\(f(t)\\) and not \\(g(t)\\), we need to consider how these modifications affect the state probabilities.\n\n3. **State Probabilities**:\n   The state probabilities at time \\(T\\) depend on the transition matrix \\(P(T)\\) derived from the original or modified transition rate matrix. For the original matrix \\(Q\\), the state probabilities can be found using the matrix exponential \\(e^{QT}\\).\n\n4. **Final Observed Probabilities**:\n   If we observe the state probabilities at time \\(T\\) after applying either \\(f(t)\\), \\(g(t)\\), or both, the key question is whether we can uniquely identify which functions were applied.\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Identification**:\n   - If only \\(f(t) = e^{\\alpha t}\\) is applied, the modified transition rate matrix becomes:\n     \\[\n     Q_f = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\lambda e^{\\alpha T} & \\lambda e^{\\alpha T} \\\\ \\mu & -\\mu \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     This results in a different set of transition probabilities compared to the original.\n   - If only \\(g(t)\\) is applied, the modified transition rate matrix becomes:\n     \\[\n     Q_g = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\lambda & \\lambda \\\\ \\mu g(T) & -\\mu g(T) \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     This also results in a different set of transition probabilities.\n   - If both \\(f(t)\\) and \\(g(t)\\) are applied, the modified transition rate matrix becomes:\n     \\[\n     Q_{fg} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\lambda e^{\\alpha T} & \\lambda e^{\\alpha T} \\\\ \\mu g(T) & -\\mu g(T) \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n     Again, this results in a unique set of transition probabilities.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Since each combination of scaling functions (either \\(f(t)\\), \\(g(t)\\), or both) results in a unique set of transition probabilities, we can indeed determine which scaling functions were applied based on the final observed probabilities.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transition Rate Matrix**:\n   The given transition rate matrix \\( Q = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\lambda & \\lambda \\\\ \\mu & -\\mu \\end{bmatrix} \\) describes a continuous-time Markov chain with states 1 and 2. The elements of the matrix represent the transition rates between these states.\n\n2. **Effect of Scaling Functions**:\n   The scaling function \\( f(t) = e^{\\alpha t} \\) modifies the transition rates. If both \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) are applied, it means that the transition rates are scaled by different functions over time.\n\n3. **Observed State Probabilities**:\n   We are given the observed state probabilities at time \\( t = T \\). Let's denote these probabilities as \\( P_1(T) \\) and \\( P_2(T) \\).\n\n4. **Determining the Scaling Function(s)**:\n   To determine whether \\( f(t) \\) or \\( g(t) \\) (or both) were applied, we need to consider how the scaling affects the transition rates and subsequently the state probabilities at time \\( T \\).\n\n5. **Analyzing the Impact**:\n   - If only \\( f(t) \\) was applied, the transition rates would be scaled by \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\).\n   - If only \\( g(t) \\) was applied, the transition rates would be scaled by \\( e^{\\beta t} \\) (where \\( \\beta \\) is another constant).\n   - If both were applied, the transition rates would be scaled by \\( e^{\\alpha t} \\cdot e^{\\beta t} = e^{(\\alpha + \\beta)t} \\).\n\n6. **Final Observed Probabilities**:\n   The final observed probabilities \\( P_1(T) \\) and \\( P_2(T) \\) depend on the overall effect of the scaling functions on the transition rates. However, without knowing the specific values of \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) (if both functions were applied), it is not possible to uniquely determine which scaling functions were applied just from the final observed probabilities.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   Since the observed state probabilities alone do not provide enough information to distinguish between the application of \\( f(t) \\), \\( g(t) \\), or both, we cannot definitively determine the exact scaling functions used.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
