    "To determine if we can infer that \\(x(t)\\) was necessarily of frequency \\(\\omega\\) based on observing a significant response in \\(z(t)\\) at time \\(T\\), let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral**: \n   - The function \\(z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{i\\omega s} x(s) \\, ds\\) represents a convolution of the input signal \\(x(t)\\) with a complex exponential function \\(e^{i\\omega s}\\). This operation is commonly used in frequency domain analysis.\n\n2. **Significant Response at Time \\(T\\)**:\n   - A significant response in \\(z(t)\\) at time \\(T\\) suggests that the integral from 0 to \\(T\\) of \\(e^{i\\omega s} x(s)\\) is large. \n\n3. **Implication of Significant Response**:\n   - For the integral to be significantly large, the product \\(e^{i\\omega s} x(s)\\) must also be large over the interval [0, T]. Since \\(e^{i\\omega s}\\) is a complex exponential function, its magnitude is always 1 (because \\(|e^{i\\omega s}| = 1\\)). Therefore, the magnitude of \\(x(s)\\) must be significant over the interval [0, T].\n\n4. **Frequency Consideration**:\n   - The presence of a significant response does not necessarily mean that \\(x(t)\\) is purely of frequency \\(\\omega\\). It could contain other frequencies, but the contribution of those frequencies might be small enough that they do not significantly affect the integral.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While a significant response in \\(z(t)\\) at time \\(T\\) indicates that \\(x(t)\\) has some component at frequency \\(\\omega\\), it does not guarantee that \\(x(t)\\) is purely of frequency \\(\\omega\\). There could be other frequency components present in \\(x(t)\\) that contribute to the integral without dominating it.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot infer with certainty that \\(x(t)\\) was necessarily of frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
