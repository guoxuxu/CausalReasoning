This is a pure sinusoidal signal with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} e^{i \\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i (\\omega - \\xi) t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral does not converge in the usual sense for a continuous-time signal like this, but it can be interpreted using distributions (Dirac delta function). The result is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\xi) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n\n3. **Phase Shift Intervention**: If there is a phase shift \\( \\phi \\) introduced, the function becomes \\( z(t) = e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi)} \\). The Fourier transform of this function is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi)})(\\xi) = 2\\pi e^{i \\phi} \\delta(\\xi - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   Here, the phase shift \\( \\phi \\) is reflected in the Fourier transform as a multiplicative factor \\( e^{i \\phi} \\).\n\n4. **Analyzing at Frequency \\( \\omega \\)**: When we evaluate the Fourier transform at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\omega) = 2\\pi e^{i \\phi}\n   \\]\n   From this, we can extract the phase information directly as \\( \\phi \\) from the complex exponential \\( e^{i \\phi} \\).\n\nTherefore, by analyzing the Fourier transform at the frequency \\( \\omega \\), we can indeed determine the exact value of the phase shift \\( \\phi \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can exactly determine the phase shift \\(\\phi\\) just by analyzing at frequency \\(\\omega\\), let's go through the steps of applying the Fourier transform to the given function and then analyze the result.\n\n1. **Given Function**: \n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Definition**:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z(t))(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute \\(z(t)\\)** into the Fourier Transform:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(e^{i \\omega t})(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\xi t} e^{i \\omega t} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i (\\omega - \\xi) t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   The integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i (\\omega - \\xi) t} \\, dt\\) is a representation of the Dirac delta function \\(\\delta(\\xi - \\omega)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(e^{i \\omega t})(\\xi) = 2 \\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Phase Analysis**:\n   The Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(e^{i \\omega t})(\\xi)\\) evaluated at \\(\\xi = \\omega\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(e^{i \\omega t})(\\omega) = 2 \\pi \\delta(0) = 2 \\pi\n   \\]\n   The phase of the Fourier transform at \\(\\xi = \\omega\\) is \\(0\\) because the Fourier transform is purely real and positive at that point.\n\n6. **Intervention with Phase Shift \\(\\phi\\)**:\n   If there is a phase shift \\(\\phi\\), the function becomes \\(z(t) = e^{i (\\omega + \\phi) t}\\). The Fourier transform now is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(e^{i (\\omega + \\phi) t})(\\xi) = 2 \\pi \\delta(\\xi - (\\omega + \\phi))\n   \\]\n   Evaluating at \\(\\xi = \\omega\\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(e^{i (\\omega + \\phi) t})(\\omega) = 2 \\pi \\delta(\\omega - (\\omega + \\phi)) = 2 \\pi \\delta(-\\phi)\n   \\]\n   The phase of the Fourier transform at \\(\\xi = \\omega\\) will still be \\(0\\) but the function itself is shifted in frequency domain by \\(\\phi\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   By analyzing the Fourier transform at \\(\\xi = \\omega\\), we can only determine the presence of the frequency \\(\\omega\\) and not the specific phase shift \\(\\phi\\). The phase information is lost in this single evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The given function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).
