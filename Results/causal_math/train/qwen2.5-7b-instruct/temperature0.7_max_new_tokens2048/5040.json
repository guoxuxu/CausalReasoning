    "To determine if we can deduce precisely which transformations (C, D, or both) were applied based only on the outcome \\( T(z) \\), let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Transformations**: We have two matrices, \\( C \\) and \\( D \\). The initial state is transformed by \\( C \\) to get \\( z \\):\n   \\[\n   z = Cw\n   \\]\n   Then, \\( z \\) undergoes an integral transform:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}z(t) dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Final State Involving Both Matrices**: Suppose the final state involves both transformations:\n   \\[\n   T(D(Cw)) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st}D(Cw)(t) dt\n   \\]\n   This means the initial state \\( w \\) is first transformed by \\( C \\) to \\( z \\), and then \\( z \\) is transformed by \\( D \\).\n\n3. **Invertibility Consideration**: For us to be able to deduce which transformations were applied, the transformations must be invertible.
