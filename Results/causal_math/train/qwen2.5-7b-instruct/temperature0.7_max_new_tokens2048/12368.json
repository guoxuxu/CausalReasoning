The Laplace transform (or its variants) generally do not directly handle such non-linear exponential terms easily.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a function \\( z(x) \\) that includes an exponential term \\( e^{ax^2} \\).

    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what the Laplace transform does.

It seems there might be a typo in the problem statement since \\( z(x) \\) is not fully defined.

The presence of \\( e^{ax^2} \\) in \\( z(x) \\) means that when computing the Laplace transform, we would have an expression involving \\( e^{ax^2} \\cdot e^{-st} \\).\n\n4. The Laplace transform inherently accounts for the exponential term \\( e^{-st} \\), but it doesn't directly handle non-linear terms like \\( e^{ax^2} \\). The Laplace transform is linear and operates on functions of time (or in this case, presumably, a variable similar to \\( t \\)).\n\n5. If \\( x \\) is not the same variable as \\( t \\) in the Laplace transform definition, then the \\( e^{ax^2} \\) term is not part of the standard Laplace transform process.
