When transformed to \\(h(x, y) = g(x, y) + e^{kx}\\), the additional term \\(e^{kx}\\) introduces a non-harmonic component into the boundary conditions.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to the boundary conditions changes how the system behaves. The Fourier transform decomposes the boundary conditions into a series of harmonic functions.
