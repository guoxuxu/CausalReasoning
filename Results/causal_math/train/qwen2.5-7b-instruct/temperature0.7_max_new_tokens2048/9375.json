This means:\n     \\[\n     p(t) = h(t) + k(t) = \\left(\\frac{d^2g}{dt^2} - 2\\frac{dg}{dt} + g\\right) + \\left(g + t\\frac{dg}{dt}\\right)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying:\n     \\[\n     p(t) = \\frac{d^2g}{dt^2} - 2\\frac{dg}{dt} + g + g + t\\frac{dg}{dt} = \\frac{d^2g}{dt^2} - \\frac{dg}{dt} + 2g + t\\frac{dg}{dt}\n     \\]\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( p(t) \\) would involve both \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{M} \\), thus depending on both operators.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the application of \\( \\mathcal{M} \\) introduces additional terms that are not solely dependent on \\( \\mathcal{L} \\), the resulting Laplace transform \\( G(s) \\) will indeed depend on both \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{M} \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
