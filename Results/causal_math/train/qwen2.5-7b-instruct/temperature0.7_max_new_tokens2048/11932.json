    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The initial state of the system is given by \\( y_0 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( f(y) \\)**: At \\( t = 0 \\), the function \\( f(y) = e^{Bt}y \\) is applied to \\( y_0 \\). Since \\( B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   e^{Bt} = \\cos(t)I + \\sin(t)B\n   \\]\n   This can be written out as:\n   \\[\n   e^{Bt} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(t) & -\\sin(t) \\\\ \\sin(t) & \\cos(t) \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n   Applying this to \\( y_0 \\):\n   \\[\n   f(y_0) = e^{Bt}y_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(t) & -\\sin(t) \\\\ \\sin(t) & \\cos(t) \\end{pmatrix} y_0\n   \\]\n   This represents a rotation of \\( y_0 \\) by an angle \\( t \\).\n\n3. **System Evolution**: After applying \\( f(y) \\), the system evolves according to \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\), where \\( A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\). The solution to this differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = e^{At}y_1\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( y_1 = f(y_0) \\), so:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = e^{At} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(t) & -\\sin(t) \\\\ \\sin(t) & \\cos(t) \\end{pmatrix} y_0 \\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Matrix Exponential for \\( A \\)**: The matrix exponential \\( e^{At} \\) for \\( A \\) is:\n   \\[\n   e^{At} = \\cos(t)I + \\sin(t)A\n   \\]\n   Which simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   e^{At} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(t) & \\sin(t) \\\\ -\\sin(t) & \\cos(t) \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Combined Transformation**: Combining these transformations:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(t) & \\sin(t) \\\\ -\\sin(t) & \\cos(t) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(t) & -\\sin(t) \\\\ \\sin(t) & \\cos(t) \\end{pmatrix} \\right) y_0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the matrix product:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(t) & \\sin(t) \\\\ -\\sin(t) & \\cos(t) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(t) & -\\sin(t) \\\\ \\sin(t) & \\cos(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) & -\\cos(t)\\sin(t) + \\sin(t)\\cos(t) \\\\ -\\sin(t)\\cos(t) + \\cos(t)\\sin(t) & \\sin^2(t) + \\cos^2(t) \\end{pmatrix}\n   \\]\n   Using trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} y_0 = y_0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The combined transformation effectively leaves \\( y_0 \\) unchanged after the rotation and subsequent evolution under \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\).\n\nTherefore, the trajectory of \\( y(t) \\) after applying \\( f(y) \\) and then evolving according to \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\) is the same as if \\( y_0 \\) was evolved directly under \\( \\dot{y} = Ay \\) for the same period.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",
