This is because the Fourier Transform decomposes a signal into its constituent frequencies, and a pure sine/cosine wave corresponds to a single frequency component.\n\n3. **Spectrum Analysis**: If we observe a primary peak at \\( \\omega \\) in the Fourier Transform, it confirms that there is a significant contribution from the frequency \\( \\omega \\) in the signal. However, this alone does not provide information about any amplitude scaling or phase shifting that might have been applied.\n\n4. **Amplitude Scaling**: Amplitude scaling would affect the magnitude of the Fourier Transform but not the location of the peak.
