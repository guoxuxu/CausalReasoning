    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation:**\n   The differential equation given is:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{T} = k(T_e - T) + S\n   \\]\n   This describes how the temperature \\(T\\) changes over time due to the difference between the external temperature \\(T_e\\) and the current reactor temperature \\(T\\), plus a source term \\(S\\).\n\n2. **Transformation Consideration:**\n   We are considering a transformation \\(f(T) = T^2\\) at a certain time. However, it's important to note that applying this transformation doesn't change the underlying differential equation itself; it only transforms the state variable \\(T\\).\n\n3. **Implication of Transformation:**\n   If we apply \\(f(T) = T^2\\) to the temperature \\(T\\), the new variable would be \\(U = T^2\\). The differential equation in terms of \\(U\\) would be:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dU}{dt} = 2T \\frac{dT}{dt}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(\\dot{T}\\) from the original equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dU}{dt} = 2T(k(T_e - T) + S)\n   \\]\n   This shows that while \\(U = T^2\\) is a transformed variable, the dynamics described by the differential equation remain the same. The transformation does not introduce any new information about when it was applied.\n\n4. **Distinguishing Between Transformations:**\n   Given the original differential equation and the fact that the transformation \\(f(T) = T^2\\) does not provide additional temporal information about its application, it is impossible to distinguish whether \\(f(T)\\), \\(g(T)\\), or both transformations were applied at different times based solely on the final temperature \\(T(T)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System Dynamics**:\n   - The original system is described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{T} = k(T_e - T) + S\\).\n   - This is a first-order linear differential equation which models the temperature \\(T\\) of the reactor over time, influenced by the external temperature \\(T_e\\), the rate constant \\(k\\), and the source term \\(S\\).\n\n2. **Transformation Consideration**:\n   - We are considering a transformation \\(f(T) = T^2\\).
