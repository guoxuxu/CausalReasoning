    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transformation**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty z(t)e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty 1 \\, dt\n   \\]\n   However, this integral does not converge in the usual sense because it integrates a constant function over the entire real line. For a proper analysis, we should consider the Fourier transform in the context of distributions or tempered distributions, where it simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function and \\( \\omega_0 \\) is the frequency corresponding to \\( \\omega \\).\n\n3. **New Operation**: The new operation \\( G(z)(t) = \\int z(t)e^{i\\omega' t} dt \\). Substituting \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\):\n   \\[\n   G(z)(t) = \\int e^{i\\omega t} e^{i\\omega' t} dt = \\int e^{i(\\omega + \\omega') t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral also does not converge in the usual sense for all \\( t \\). In the context of distributions, it can be interpreted as:\n   \\[\n   G(z)(t) = 2\\pi \\delta(t - t_0)\n   \\]\n   where \\( t_0 \\) is the time corresponding to the frequency \\( \\omega + \\omega' \\).\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The Fourier transform \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) depends only on the frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n   - The new operation \\( G(z)(t) \\) introduces a dependency on \\( \\omega' \\), but it does not affect the output of \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) directly since \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) is already determined solely by \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the outcome of \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) remains dependent only on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( \\omega' \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
