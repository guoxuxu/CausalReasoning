For the states to be identical at any time \\(t\\), the transformation must preserve the dynamics of the SDE. This means that if we start from \\(X_0\\) and apply \\(h(X)\\) to it, and then let it evolve, it should be equivalent to starting from \\(X_0 + k\\) and letting it evolve directly.\n\n4. **Linearity Consideration**: If \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) are linear in \\(X_t\\), then the transformation \\(h(X) = X + k\\) would indeed commute with the SDE. However, in general, the drift term \\(\\mu\\) and diffusion term \\(\\sigma\\) are not necessarily linear in \\(X_t\\), which means that the transformation does not generally commute with the SDE.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: In general, applying a deterministic transformation \\(h(X) = X + k\\) to the initial state \\(X_0\\) and then evolving it according to the SDE will not result in the same state as evolving \\(X_0 + k\\) directly according to the SDE. The transformation modifies the initial condition but does not preserve the dynamics over time due to the nonlinearity of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
