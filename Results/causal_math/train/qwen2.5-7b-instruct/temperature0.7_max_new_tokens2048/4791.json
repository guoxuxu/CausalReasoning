The combined transfer function is the sum of the original transfer function and the effect of the compensatory control:\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = H(s)U(s) + (-K(s)D(s))U(s)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1}U(s) + \\frac{25}{(s+2)^2}U(s)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( K(s)D(s) \\) is specifically designed to cancel out the disturbance, it should ideally result in a net transfer function from \\( u(t) \\) to \\( y(t) \\) that is simply \\( H(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\left(\\frac{1}{s+1} + \\frac{25}{(s+2)^2}\\right)U(s)\n   \\]\n   However, for the system to truly reflect only the influence of \\( u(t) \\) (i.e., the net effect of the compensatory control should not alter the transfer function from \\( u(t) \\) to \\( y(t) \\)), the compensatory control must perfectly cancel the disturbance. In this case, the compensatory control \\( K(s) = -\\frac{5}{s+2} \\) does exactly that, ensuring that the disturbance does not affect the output when considering the compensatory control.\n\nTherefore, the system's output \\( y(t) \\) will indeed reflect only the influence of the input \\( u(t) \\), independent of the disturbance.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
