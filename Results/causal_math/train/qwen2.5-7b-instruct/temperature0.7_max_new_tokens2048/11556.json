    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The matrix \\( M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\) represents a linear transformation on the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} u(t) \\\\ v(t) \\end{pmatrix}\\).

    "To address this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: We have a linear transformation matrix \\( M \\) that affects the signal \\( z(t) \\).

Applying the transformation matrix \\( M \\) to \\( z(t) \\) gives us a new signal \\( z'(t) = Mz(t) \\).
