    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: We start with \\( z(0) = z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: The transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{Dt} z(t) \\, dt \\) is applied to \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\). This gives us:\n   - \\( T(z_0) = \\int_0^0 e^{Dt} z_0 \\, dt = 0 \\) (since the integral from 0 to 0 is zero).\n\n3. **Differential Equation**: The original differential equation governing \\( z(t) \\) is \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\). The solution to this equation is:\n   - \\( z(t) = z_0 e^{Ct} \\).\n\n4. **Applying Transformation**: Now we apply the transformation \\( T \\) to \\( z(t) = z_0 e^{Ct} \\):\n   - \\( T(z(t)) = \\int_0^t e^{D\\tau} z(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\int_0^t e^{D\\tau} z_0 e^{C\\tau} \\, d\\tau = z_0 \\int_0^t e^{(D+C)\\tau} \\, d\\tau \\).\n   - Evaluating the integral, we get: \\( T(z(t)) = z_0 \\left[ \\frac{e^{(D+C)t} - 1}{D+C} \\right] \\).\n\n5. **Evolving Under Original Equation**: If we evolve \\( z_0 \\) directly under \\( \\dot{z} = Cz \\), we get:\n   - \\( z(T) = z_0 e^{CT} \\).\n\n6. **Comparison**: We need to compare \\( T(z(T)) \\) with \\( z(T) \\):\n   - \\( T(z(T)) = T(z_0 e^{CT}) = z_0 \\left[ \\frac{e^{(D+C)T} - 1}{D+C} \\right] \\).\n   - \\( z(T) = z_0 e^{CT} \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Clearly, \\( T(z(T)) \\neq z(T) \\) unless \\( D = 0 \\).
