    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) satisfying the differential equation \\( \\ddot{z} + \\omega^2 z = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   s^2 Z(s) - s u(0) - \\dot{u}(0) + \\omega^2 Z(s) = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (s^2 + \\omega^2) Z(s) = s u(0) + \\dot{u}(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{s u(0) + \\dot{u}(0)}{s^2 + \\omega^2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Modified Initial Conditions**: If we modify the initial conditions by adding a constant \\( c \\) to \\( u(0) \\), the new initial condition becomes \\( u(0) + c \\). Let the new function be \\( \\tilde{z}(t) = \\tilde{u}(t) + i\\tilde{v}(t) \\).\n\n4. **New Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of the new function with the modified initial condition is:\n   \\[\n   \\tilde{Z}(s) = \\frac{s (u(0) + c) + \\dot{u}(0)}{s^2 + \\omega^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\tilde{Z}(s) = \\frac{s u(0) + sc + \\dot{u}(0)}{s^2 + \\omega^2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**: Comparing \\( Z(s) \\) and \\( \\tilde{Z}(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{s u(0) + \\dot{u}(0)}{s^2 + \\omega^2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\tilde{Z}(s) = \\frac{s u(0) + \\dot{u}(0) + sc}{s^2 + \\omega^2}\n   \\]\n   We see that \\( \\tilde{Z}(s) \\) has an additional term \\( \\frac{sc}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\) compared to \\( Z(s) \\).\n\n6. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{sc}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\) is \\( c \\cos(\\omega t) \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the difference between \\( \\tilde{z}(t) \\) and \\( z(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\) is \\( c \\cos(\\omega t) \\).
