For the given system, the Fourier transform will yield:\n   - \\(f(x(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i \\omega t} X_0 e^{\\lambda_1 t} dt = X_0 \\delta(\\omega - \\lambda_1)\\)\n   - \\(f(y(t)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-2\\pi i \\omega t} iY_0 e^{\\lambda_2 t} dt = iY_0 \\delta(\\omega - \\lambda_2)\\)\n\n   Therefore, the transformed state \\(f(z)\\) will consist of impulses at frequencies \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\).\n\n4. **Determining Interventions**: Given the transformed state \\(z(T)\\) in the frequency domain, which consists of impulses at specific frequencies, it is indeed possible to determine the original dynamics (i.e., the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)) without ambiguity. This is because each impulse corresponds directly to an eigenvalue of the respective matrix \\(A\\) or \\(B\\). Hence, knowing the exact frequencies of the impulses allows us to infer the nature of the transformations applied, such as \\(f(z)\\) or \\(g(z)\\).\n\n**Conclusion**: Based on the above reasoning, it is possible to conclusively determine whether any interventions like \\(f(z)\\) or \\(g(z)\\) were applied merely by analyzing \\(z(T)\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
