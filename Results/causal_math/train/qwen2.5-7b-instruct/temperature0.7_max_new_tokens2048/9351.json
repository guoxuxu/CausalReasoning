    "To determine whether the behavior of \\(q(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) depends solely on the new capacitance value \\(C'\\) and not on the original \\(C\\), let's analyze the given system step by step.\n\n1. **Initial System Behavior (Before Intervention):**\n   - The system is described by the differential equation \\(\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 q = 0\\).\n   - This equation describes simple harmonic motion with angular frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n   - The presence of an external sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\) would cause the charge \\(q(t)\\) to respond to this forcing term.\n   - The solution to this equation, considering the sinusoidal forcing, can be written as:\n     \\[\n     q(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t) + \\frac{V_0}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t)\n     \\]\n     where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\n2. **Intervention at Time \\(t = t_1\\):**\n   - At \\(t = t_1\\), the capacitance is changed from \\(C\\) to \\(C'\\).\n   - The new differential equation becomes \\(\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\omega'^2 q = 0\\), where \\(\\omega' = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{C'}}\\).\n\n3. **Behavior Post-Intervention (\\(t > t_1\\)):**\n   - For \\(t > t_1\\), the system now has a new angular frequency \\(\\omega' = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{C'}}\\).\n   - The charge \\(q(t)\\) after the intervention will be influenced by the new frequency \\(\\omega'\\).\n   - The general form of the solution for \\(t > t_1\\) will now be:\n     \\[\n     q(t) = A' \\cos(\\omega' t) + B' \\sin(\\omega' t) + \\frac{V_0}{\\omega'} \\sin(\\omega' t)\n     \\]\n     where \\(A'\\) and \\(B'\\) are new constants determined by the state of the system just after the intervention.\n\n4. **Dependence Analysis:**\n   - The behavior of \\(q(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) depends on the new capacitance \\(C'\\) through \\(\\omega' = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{C'}}\\).\n   - The initial conditions and the state of the system at \\(t = t_1\\) (which includes the charge and current at that moment) determine \\(A'\\) and \\(B'\\).\n   - However, the key point is that once the intervention occurs, the system evolves according to the new parameters, and the original capacitance \\(C\\) does not directly influence the subsequent behavior unless it affects the initial conditions at \\(t = t_1\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, we conclude that the behavior of \\(q(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) primarily depends on the new capacitance \\(C'\\) and not on the original capacitance \\(C\\), assuming no other factors intervene.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To address this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System Before Intervention**:\n   - The given differential equation \\(\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 q = 0\\) describes the behavior of a capacitor in an electrical circuit under the influence of an external sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\).\n   - This equation implies that the system is in resonance with the external frequency \\(\\omega\\), and the solution for \\(q(t)\\) will be a sinusoidal function of the same frequency but with a phase shift and amplitude determined by the initial conditions and the parameters of the system (including the capacitance \\(C\\)).\n\n2. **Intervention and Its Impact**:\n   - At time \\(t = t_1\\), the capacitance is changed from \\(C\\) to \\(C'\\).\n   - Changing the capacitance changes the natural frequency of the system, which is given by \\(\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}\\) for an LC circuit, although in this case, it's specifically related to the capacitance for a simple RC circuit where the differential equation is given.\n\n3. **Behavior After Intervention**:\n   - The new differential equation after the change in capacitance becomes \\(\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\omega'^2 q = 0\\), where \\(\\omega' = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{L C'}}\\). Since the system is now influenced by the new capacitance \\(C'\\), the behavior of \\(q(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) will be governed by this new frequency.\n   - Importantly, the behavior of \\(q(t)\\) after the intervention will depend on the new capacitance \\(C'\\) because the natural frequency of the system has changed. However, the initial conditions just before the intervention (at \\(t = t_1\\)) will also play a role in determining the exact form of \\(q(t)\\) after the change.\n\n4. **Dependency on Original Capacitance \\(C\\)**:\n   - While the new behavior of \\(q(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) is primarily driven by the new capacitance \\(C'\\), the initial conditions at \\(t = t_1\\) still depend on the state of the system before the intervention, which was influenced by the original capacitance \\(C\\).\n   - Therefore, the behavior of \\(q(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) does not solely depend on the new capacitance \\(C'\\) but also on the initial conditions at \\(t = t_1\\), which were influenced by the original capacitance \\(C\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
