    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine if the transformation \\(h(z)\\) will be solely determined by the initial condition \\(z_0\\) when no input \\(u(t)\\) is applied.\n\n1. **Differential Equation Analysis**:\n   - The differential equation governing \\(z(t)\\) is \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\).\n   - This is a homogeneous linear differential equation because there is no external input \\(u(t)\\).\n\n2. **Solution to the Differential Equation**:\n   - For a homogeneous linear differential equation \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz\\), the solution can be expressed as \\(z(t) = z_0 e^{Mt}\\), where \\(z_0\\) is the initial condition at \\(t=0\\).\n\n3. **Transformation \\(h(z)\\)**:\n   - The transformation is given by \\(h(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt\\).\n   - Substituting \\(z(t) = z_0 e^{Mt}\\) into the integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     h(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z_0 e^{Mt} dt = z_0 \\int_0^\\infty e^{(M-s)t} dt.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Evaluating the Integral**:\n   - To evaluate the integral, consider the Laplace transform properties and the form of the exponential function.\n   - The integral \\(\\int_0^\\infty e^{(M-s)t} dt\\) converges if the real part of \\(s - M\\) is positive (i.e., \\(\\text{Re}(s - M) > 0\\)).\n   - Assuming this condition is met, the integral evaluates to:\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^\\infty e^{(M-s)t} dt = \\frac{1}{s - M}.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore,\n     \\[\n     h(z) = z_0 \\frac{1}{s - M}.\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the above steps, it is clear that \\(h(z)\\) is directly proportional to the initial condition \\(z_0\\).\n   - No other factors (such as the dynamics of \\(z(t)\\) over time due to \\(u(t)\\)) affect \\(h(z)\\) when \\(u(t) = 0\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the transformation \\(h(z)\\) will indeed be solely determined by the initial condition \\(z_0\\) if no input \\(u(t)\\) is applied throughout the evolution.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
