    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original System**: The original system is described by the differential equation \\(\\ddot{x} + \\omega^2 x = 0\\). This is a simple harmonic oscillator with no external forces and no damping.\n\n2. **Linear Transformation \\(T(x)\\)**: The transformation \\(T(x) = Ax + B\\) is applied to the state \\(x\\). However, this transformation does not change the underlying dynamics of the system because it is applied as a static transformation and does not affect the time derivatives directly.\n\n3. **Intervention \\(U(x)\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), another linear transformation \\(U(x) = Cx + D\\) is applied. This can be seen as changing the state variable from \\(x\\) to a new state variable \\(y = U(x)\\).\n\n4. **Transformation of Dynamics**: To understand how this affects the system, we need to express the original differential equation in terms of the new state variable \\(y\\):\n   - Let \\(y = Cx + D\\).\n   - Then \\(x = C^{-1}(y - D)\\) (assuming \\(C\\) is invertible).\n   - The first derivative \\(\\dot{x}\\) becomes \\(\\dot{x} = C^{-1}\\dot{y} - C^{-1}\\dot{D}\\).\n   - The second derivative \\(\\ddot{x}\\) becomes \\(\\ddot{x} = C^{-1}\\ddot{y} - 2C^{-1}\\ddot{D} + C^{-1}\\ddot{D}^2\\).\n\n5. **Substituting into Original Equation**: Substituting these into the original differential equation:\n   - \\(\\ddot{x} + \\omega^2 x = 0\\)\n   - \\((C^{-1}\\ddot{y} - 2C^{-1}\\ddot{D} + C^{-1}\\ddot{D}^2) + \\omega^2(C^{-1}(y - D)) = 0\\)\n\n6. **Simplifying**: Simplifying the above expression:\n   - \\(\\ddot{y} - 2C^{-1}\\ddot{D} + C^{-1}\\ddot{D}^2 + \\omega^2C^{-1}y - \\omega^2C^{-1}D = 0\\)\n\n7. **Effect of \\(D\\)**: Note that \\(\\ddot{D}\\) and \\(\\ddot{D}^2\\) are constants or functions of time that do not affect the general form of the oscillatory behavior unless they introduce nonlinearity or external forcing, which is not considered here.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The transformed system's dynamics will still be governed by a similar harmonic oscillator equation but possibly with different coefficients due to the transformations \\(C\\) and \\(D\\). However, the fundamental nature of the system as a harmonic oscillator remains unchanged, and the solution will still exhibit oscillatory behavior dependent on \\(\\omega\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the system state \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) will indeed depend on \\(\\omega\\) but also on \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) due to the transformation.

Its solutions are well-known to be of the form \\(x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t)\\), where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\n2. **Linear Transformation \\(T(x) = Ax + B\\)**: This transformation does not affect the dynamics of the system because it is applied to the state variable \\(x\\) but does not change the underlying differential equation governing the system. It merely shifts and scales the state space, but the form of the solution remains unchanged. The transformed state \\(y = T(x) = Ax + B\\) would still satisfy the same differential equation, but with possibly different initial conditions.\n\n3. **Intervention \\(U(x) = Cx + D\\)**: At some time \\(t_1\\), an intervention \\(U(x) = Cx + D\\) is applied. This intervention can be thought of as changing the state of the system to \\(y = U(x)\\) at \\(t = t_1\\). However, after \\(t_1\\), the system should revert to its original dynamics unless there is a continuous forcing term or external input that changes the nature of the system.\n\n4. **Post-Intervention Dynamics**: After the intervention, if no further forcing terms or inputs are considered, the system should again follow the original differential equation \\(\\ddot{y} + \\omega^2 y = 0\\), where \\(y = U(x)\\). The transformation \\(U(x)\\) itself does not change the natural frequency \\(\\omega\\) of the system; it only changes the initial conditions.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The state \\(x(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) will indeed depend on \\(\\omega\\) because the system reverts to its original dynamics after the intervention.
