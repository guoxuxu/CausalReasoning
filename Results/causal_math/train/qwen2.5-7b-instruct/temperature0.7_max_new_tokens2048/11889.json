    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation Analysis**:\n   - The given differential equation is \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = 2tz\\).\n   - This is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n   - The general solution to this ODE can be found using separation of variables or integrating factors.\n   - Separating variables, we get \\(\\frac{dz}{z} = 2t dt\\).\n   - Integrating both sides, we have \\(\\ln|z| = t^2 + C\\), where \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n   - Exponentiating both sides, we get \\(z(t) = Ce^{t^2}\\).\n\n2. **Initial Condition**:\n   - Given \\(z(0) = z_0\\), substituting \\(t = 0\\) into the general solution gives \\(z_0 = C\\).\n   - Therefore, the specific solution is \\(z(t) = z_0 e^{t^2}\\).\n\n3. **Integral Transformation**:\n   - The transformation is defined as \\(T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-s^2}z(s) ds\\).\n   - Substituting \\(z(s) = z_0 e^{s^2}\\) into the integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-s^2} z_0 e^{s^2} ds = z_0 \\int_0^t ds = z_0 t\n     \\]\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Initial Condition**:\n   - From the expression for \\(T(z)\\), we see that \\(T(z) = z_0 t\\).\n   - Knowing \\(T(z)\\) at any time \\(T\\) allows us to directly solve for \\(z_0\\) as \\(z_0 = \\frac{T(z)}{T}\\).\n   - Since \\(T(z)\\) depends only on \\(z_0\\) and \\(t\\), and we know \\(T\\) at time \\(T\\), we can uniquely determine \\(z_0\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
