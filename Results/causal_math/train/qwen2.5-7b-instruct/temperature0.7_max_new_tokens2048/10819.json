If we assume no intervention for simplicity, then \\( z(\\tau) = e^{i \\omega \\tau} z_0 \\) for all \\( \\tau \\geq 0 \\).\n\n4. **Assessing the Effect of Introducing a Different Frequency \\( \\omega' \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\)**:\n   - If the frequency changes to \\( \\omega' \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\), then for \\( t_1 \\leq \\tau \\leq t \\), \\( z(\\tau) = e^{i \\omega' (\\tau - t_1)} e^{i \\omega t_1} z_0 \\).\n   - The transformation becomes \\( T(z) = z_0 t_1 + \\int_{t_1}^t e^{-i \\omega \\tau} (e^{i \\omega' (\\tau - t_1)} e^{i \\omega t_1} z_0) d\\tau \\).\n\n5. **Simplifying the New Integral**:\n   - This can be simplified to \\( T(z) = z_0 t_1 + z_0 e^{i \\omega t_1} \\int_{t_1}^t e^{-i \\omega \\tau + i \\omega' (\\tau - t_1)} d\\tau \\).\n   - Further simplification gives \\( T(z) = z_0 t_1 + z_0 e^{i \\omega t_1} \\int_{t_1}^t e^{i (\\omega' - \\omega) (\\tau - t_1)} d\\tau \\).\n\n6. **Final Expression**:\n   - The integral evaluates to \\( \\frac{1}{i (\\omega' - \\omega)} (e^{i (\\omega' - \\omega) (t - t_1)} - 1) \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The transformation \\( T(z) \\) now includes terms that depend on both frequencies \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\omega' \\).
