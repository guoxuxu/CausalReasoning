  "Explanation": "By applying the transformation \\\\(f(z) = z^n\\\\), the initial condition is modified from \\\\(z_0\\\\) to \\\\(z_0^n\\\\). Given the non-linearity of the exponential decay equation and the transformation, the trajectory and the final state at \\\\(t = T\\\\) will be different from the direct application due to the multiplicative power raising.",

Directly solving the differential equation starting from z0 also leads to z(T), which is affected by λ but not by the initial function f(z).
