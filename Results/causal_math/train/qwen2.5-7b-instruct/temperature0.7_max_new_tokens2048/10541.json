This is because the Fourier transform and its inverse are bijective (one-to-one and onto) operations for a wide class of functions, including those like \\(z(t)\\).\n\n4. **Effect of Filter Function**: If we modify the spectrum by a filter function \\(H(\\omega)\\), the transformed signal becomes \\(Z(\\omega)H(\\omega)\\). Then, applying the inverse Fourier transform would result in a modified signal \\(z'(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{Z(\\omega)H(\\omega)\\}\\).
