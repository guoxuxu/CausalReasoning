When such an input is applied to a system described by a differential equation, it can be seen as a way to probe the system's behavior through the Laplace domain.\n\n2. **Natural Dynamics**: If no additional intervention (other than the initial application of \\( u(t) \\)) occurs after \\( t = 0 \\), the system will evolve according to its natural dynamics.
