The transformation from \\( f(z) \\) to \\( g(z) \\) changes the function being integrated, but it doesn't depend on the original function itself; it depends on the new function \\( g(z) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The end result of the integral over \\( C \\) does not depend solely on the original \\( f(z) \\); it depends on the specific function \\( g(z) = e^{2z} \\) that was used during the calculation.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\( f(z) = e^z \\).\n\n2. **Contour Integration**: We are considering the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over a closed contour \\( C \\) in the complex plane. By Cauchy's Integral Theorem, if \\( f(z) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on \\( C \\), then:\n   \\[\n   \\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = 0\n   \\]\n   Since \\( e^z \\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane), this holds true for \\( f(z) \\).\n\n3. **Modified Function**: The function is modified to \\( g(z) = e^{2z} \\). This changes the form of the function being integrated.\n\n4. **Effect of Modification**: The modification from \\( f(z) \\) to \\( g(z) \\) changes the nature of the function being integrated.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Contour Integral**: The original function is \\( f(z) = e^z \\). When integrating this function over a closed contour \\( C \\) in the complex plane, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\oint_C e^z \\, dz\n   \\]\n   According to Cauchy's integral theorem, if \\( f(z) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) in a simply connected domain containing \\( C \\), then the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over any closed contour in that domain is zero. Since \\( e^z \\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane), the integral is:\n   \\[\n   \\oint_C e^z \\, dz = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Modified Function and Contour Integral**: Now, consider the modified function \\( g(z) = e^{2z} \\).
