Other functions could also have the same Fourier transform under certain conditions.\n\n6. **General Case**: In general, if \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\) peaks at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\), it suggests that \\( z(t) \\) is likely of the form \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\), but it does not definitively prove it without additional information.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we cannot conclusively deduce that \\( z(t) \\) was \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) just from the fact that its Fourier transform peaks at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Given Information**:\n   - We have a function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt \\).\n   - It is stated that if the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\) peaks at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\), we need to determine if we can deduce that \\( z(t) \\) was \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) before transformation.\n\n2. **Understanding the Fourier Transform**:\n   - For the function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), its Fourier transform is a Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\). This means \\( \\mathcal{F}(e^{i \\omega t})(\\xi) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\).\n   - A Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(x - a) \\) peaks sharply at \\( x = a \\) and is zero elsewhere.\n\n3. **Implication of the Peak**:\n   - If the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\) peaks at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\), it suggests that the original function \\( z(t) \\) has a specific form that leads to this peak.\n   - In the context of the Fourier transform, a peak at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\) for the transformed function typically indicates that the original function \\( z(t) \\) is a complex exponential \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the Fourier transform of \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) indeed peaks at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\), and knowing that a peak at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\) in the Fourier domain corresponds to the presence of \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) in the time domain, we can reasonably deduce that the original function \\( z(t) \\) was \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and the properties of the Fourier transform, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To address this question, let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} e^{i \\omega t} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i (\\omega - \\xi) t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This integral is a representation of the Dirac delta function, specifically:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Fourier transform peaks at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Given Information**: We are told that the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) peaks at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\). Mathematically, this means:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) \\text{ has a peak at } \\xi = \\omega\n   \\]\n\n3. **Inversion of Fourier Transform**: The inverse Fourier transform would give us back the original function \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) e^{i \\xi t} \\, d\\xi\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega) e^{i \\xi t} \\, d\\xi = e^{i \\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: From the above steps, we see that if the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) peaks at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\), then \\( z(t) \\) must be \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\). Conversely, if \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\), its Fourier transform will indeed peak at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, knowing that the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) peaks at \\( \\xi = \\omega \\) allows us to deduce that \\( z(t) \\) was \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) before the transformation.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
