Let's denote the new output as \\( z_{final}(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   z_{final}(t) = (h * g(x))(t)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Endpoint Analysis**: We are given the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) from the original system. If we know \\( z_{final}(T) \\), we need to determine if we can find \\( k \\) without knowing \\( m \\) (which is not defined in the problem but could refer to the magnitude or effect of \\( g(x) \\)).\n\n7. **Determination of \\( k \\)**: Since the scaling transformation directly scales the output, if we know \\( z(T) \\) and \\( z_{final}(T) \\), and assuming \\( g(x) \\) does not affect the scaling factor \\( k \\) directly (i.e., it doesn't introduce a different scaling factor), then:\n   \\[\n   z_{final}(T) = k \\cdot z(T)\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( k \\):\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{z_{final}(T)}{z(T)}\n   \\]\n\nGiven the above reasoning, if we have both \\( z(T) \\) and \\( z_{final}(T) \\), we can indeed determine the scaling factor \\( k \\) without needing to know \\( m \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
