    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function Definition**: The initial function is \\( u(z) = e^{Az + B\\overline{z}} \\). Here, \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are complex constants, and \\( \\overline{z} \\) is the complex conjugate of \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: The function \\( v(z) \\) is defined as \\( v(z) = C \\cdot u(z) \\), where \\( C \\) is a non-zero complex constant. This means \\( v(z) = C \\cdot e^{Az + B\\overline{z}} \\).\n\n3. **Proportionality Check**: To determine if \\( v(z) \\) is proportional to \\( u(z) \\) at any point \\( z \\), we need to check if there exists a constant \\( k \\) such that \\( v(z) = k \\cdot u(z) \\).\n\n4. **Substitute Definitions**: Substituting the definitions of \\( v(z) \\) and \\( u(z) \\):\n   - \\( v(z) = C \\cdot e^{Az + B\\overline{z}} \\)\n   - \\( u(z) = e^{Az + B\\overline{z}} \\)\n\n5. **Compare Functions**: By comparing \\( v(z) \\) and \\( u(z) \\):\n   - We see that \\( v(z) = C \\cdot u(z) \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( v(z) \\) is indeed proportional to \\( u(z) \\) with the proportionality constant being \\( C \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since \\( v(z) = C \\cdot u(z) \\), the value of \\( v(z) \\) at any point \\( z \\) is proportional to the value of \\( u(z) \\) at that point.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
