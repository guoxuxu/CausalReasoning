    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation for \\(z(t)\\):**\n   The given differential equation is \\(\\dot{z} = iz\\). This is a first-order linear differential equation. The general solution to this equation can be found by separation of variables or by recognizing it as an exponential growth/decay equation. The solution is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z_0 e^{it}\n   \\]\n   where \\(z_0 = z(0)\\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Transformation \\(T(z)\\):**\n   The transformation is defined as:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{s^2} z(s) ds\n   \\]\n   Substituting the solution \\(z(s) = z_0 e^{is}\\) into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{s^2} z_0 e^{is} ds = z_0 \\int_0^t e^{s^2 + is} ds\n   \\]\n\n3. **Inverting the Transformation:**\n   To determine if \\(z_0\\) can be deduced from \\(T(z)\\) at a later time \\(T\\), we need to consider if the integral transformation \\(T(z)\\) provides enough information to uniquely determine \\(z_0\\).\n\n   - The integral transformation involves the function \\(e^{s^2 + is}\\), which depends on both \\(s^2\\) and \\(is\\). This means that the value of \\(T(z)\\) at any point \\(T\\) will be influenced by the entire history of \\(z(t)\\) from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=T\\).\n   - However, the specific form of \\(T(z)\\) does not directly isolate \\(z_0\\). Instead, it integrates over the entire interval from 0 to \\(T\\), meaning that \\(T(z)\\) contains contributions from all values of \\(z(t)\\) during this interval.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   Given the nature of the integral transformation, it is not possible to uniquely determine \\(z_0\\) solely from \\(T(z)\\) at a later time \\(T\\).
