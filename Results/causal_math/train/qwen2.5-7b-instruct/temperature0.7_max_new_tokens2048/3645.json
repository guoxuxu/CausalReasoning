    "To determine if \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) follows the same trajectory when initialized with \\( z_0 = T(z(0)) \\) compared to evolving directly from \\( z(0) \\) under the differential equation, we need to analyze the effects of the integral transformation \\( T(z) \\).\n\n1. **Initial Condition Transformation**:\n   - The initial condition is transformed using the integral transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i \\omega s} z(s) \\, ds \\).\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), \\( T(z(0)) = \\int_0^0 e^{-i \\omega s} z(s) \\, ds = 0 \\). However, the problem states \\( z_0 = T(z(0)) \\), so \\( z_0 = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Evolution Under Differential Equation**:\n   - If we start from \\( z(0) \\) and evolve it under the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z + \\alpha \\), the solution can be found using standard methods for linear first-order differential equations.\n   - The general solution is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} (C + \\frac{\\alpha}{i \\omega}) \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\n3. **Using \\( z_0 = T(z(0)) \\)**:\n   - Since \\( z_0 = 0 \\), we need to check if the evolution starting from \\( z_0 = 0 \\) matches the original evolution starting from \\( z(0) \\).\n   - When \\( z_0 = 0 \\), the integral transformation does not change the initial condition, but the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) is still governed by the same differential equation.\n\n4. **Comparison**:\n   - Both scenarios involve the same differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z + \\alpha \\).\n   - The only difference is the initial condition. In both cases, the initial condition is transformed through the integral, but since \\( z_0 = 0 \\), the initial condition remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) will be the same whether \\( z \\) is evolved directly from \\( z(0) \\) or from \\( z_0 = T(z(0)) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
