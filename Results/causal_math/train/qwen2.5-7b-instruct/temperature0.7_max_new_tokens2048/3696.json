    "To address the question, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Given Information**:\n   - \\( L[f(t)] = F(s) \\)\n   - We need to find out if knowing \\( L[g(t)] \\) and \\( L[h(t)] \\) can help us determine the transformations applied to \\( f(t) \\).\n\n2. **Transformations**:\n   - \\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\)\n   - \\( h(t) = e^t f(t) \\)\n\n3. **Laplace Transforms of the Transformed Functions**:\n   - For \\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\):\n     The Laplace transform of \\( t^n f(t) \\) is given by \\( (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} F(s) \\). Therefore, for \\( n = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     L[g(t)] = L[t^2 f(t)] = (-1)^2 \\frac{d^2}{ds^2} F(s) = \\frac{d^2}{ds^2} F(s)\n     \\]\n     So, \\( G(s) = \\frac{d^2}{ds^2} F(s) \\).\n   \n   - For \\( h(t) = e^t f(t) \\):\n     The Laplace transform of \\( e^{at} f(t) \\) is \\( F(s-a) \\). Therefore:\n     \\[\n     L[h(t)] = L[e^t f(t)] = F(s-1)\n     \\]\n     So, \\( H(s) = F(s-1) \\).\n\n4. **Determining the Transformations**:\n   - Knowing \\( G(s) \\) allows us to determine that \\( g(t) = t^2 f(t) \\) because it is the second derivative of \\( F(s) \\).\n   - Knowing \\( H(s) \\) allows us to determine that \\( h(t) = e^t f(t) \\) because it is the shift of \\( F(s) \\) by 1 to the right.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If we know both \\( G(s) \\) and \\( H(s) \\), we can uniquely determine which transformations were applied to \\( f(t) \\): one is the second derivative (indicating multiplication by \\( t^2 \\)), and the other is a shift (indicating multiplication by \\( e^t \\)).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
