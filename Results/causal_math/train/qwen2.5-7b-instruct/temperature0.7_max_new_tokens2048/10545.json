For the given differential equation, the Fourier transform of \\( x(t) \\) can be derived as follows:\n   - Since \\( \\dot{x} = Px \\), taking the Fourier transform on both sides gives \\( i\\omega X(\\omega) = PX(\\omega) \\).\n   - This simplifies to \\( (i\\omega - P)X(\\omega) = 0 \\), which implies \\( X(\\omega) = C e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( C \\) is a constant determined by the initial condition \\( x(0) \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Initial Condition**: The initial condition \\( x(0) = x_0 \\) determines the constant \\( C \\) in the Fourier domain.

Using the convolution property of Fourier transforms, we get \\( Z(\\omega) = X(\\omega - \\omega) \\cdot \\delta(\\omega - \\omega) = X(\\omega) \\), where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function.
