  "Question Type": "from cause to effect without intervention",
  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Applying the function \\\\( f(T) = T^2 \\\\) at the initial stage changes the starting temperature to \\\\( T_0^2 \\\\). Since the rate of change of temperature is proportional to the temperature itself, the squared initial condition accelerates the temperature increase, diverging significantly from the trajectory when started at \\\\( T_0 \\\\) under \\\\(dT/dt = kT\\\\).",

  "causal_map_integration": "The initial temperature T_0 directly causes T through evolution according to the differential equation dT/dt = kT. Applying the transformation f(T) = T^2 at t=0 changes T to T^2 but does not affect the subsequent evolution of T according to dT/dt = kT. Therefore, the temperature T at t=T after applying f(T) and allowing the system to evolve is not the same as if T_0 had been directly evolved to t=T without the transformation.",
