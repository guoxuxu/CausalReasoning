    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a differential equation governing the current \\( I(t) \\) in an electrical circuit:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{I} = -RI + V_0\n   \\]\n   where \\( R \\) is the resistance and \\( V_0 \\) is the constant voltage source.\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**:\n   To analyze this system using the Laplace Transform, we apply it to both sides of the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{I}(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{-RI(t) + V_0\\}\n   \\]\n   Using properties of the Laplace Transform, we get:\n   \\[\n   sI(s) - I(0) = -RI(s) + \\frac{V_0}{s}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( I(s) \\) is the Laplace Transform of \\( I(t) \\).\n\n3. **Solving for \\( I(s) \\)**:\n   Rearrange the equation to solve for \\( I(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   (s + R)I(s) = I(0) + \\frac{V_0}{s}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   I(s) = \\frac{I(0)}{s + R} + \\frac{V_0}{s(s + R)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   To find \\( I(t) \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace Transform of \\( I(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   I(t) = I(0)e^{-Rt} + V_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{1}{R}e^{-Rt}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = I(0)e^{-Rt} + \\frac{V_0}{R} (1 - e^{-Rt})\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determining Historical Waveform**:\n   The expression for \\( I(t) \\) clearly shows how the current evolves over time based on the initial condition \\( I(0) \\) and the applied voltage \\( V_0 \\). Knowing \\( I(s) \\) allows us to precisely determine the historical waveform of \\( I(t) \\) because the inverse Laplace Transform uniquely maps back to the original time-domain function.\n\nTherefore, given the transformed state \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{I(t)\\} \\) at any time \\( t \\), we can indeed precisely determine the historical waveform of \\( I(t) \\) without needing additional information about whether the Laplace Transform was initially applied.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
