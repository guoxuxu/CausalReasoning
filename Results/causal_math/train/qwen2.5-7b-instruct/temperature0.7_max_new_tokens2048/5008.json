    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function \\( z(t) \\) is defined as \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are real functions of time \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation applied to \\( z(t) \\) is \\( h(z) = e^{i\\omega t} z \\), where \\( \\omega \\) is a constant real number and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit. This means that at any time \\( t \\), the value of \\( z \\) is scaled by a factor of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), which represents a rotation in the complex plane.\n\n3. **Observation at Time \\( T \\)**: We are given the observation of \\( z(T) \\). Let’s denote this as \\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega T} z(0) \\), where \\( z(0) \\) is the initial value of \\( z \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Inverting the Transformation**: To determine if we can specifically identify the transformation applied, we need to see if there is enough information in \\( z(T) \\) to distinguish between different possible transformations. \n\n5. **Possible Transformations**: Suppose there are two transformations, \\( h(z) \\) and \\( k(z) \\). If both transformations result in the same \\( z(T) \\), then it would be impossible to determine which one was applied based solely on observing \\( z(T) \\).\n\n6. **Analysis**:\n   - If only \\( h(z) = e^{i\\omega t} z \\) is applied, then \\( z(T) = e^{i\\omega T} z(0) \\).\n   - If another transformation \\( k(z) \\) is applied, it would need to produce the same \\( z(T) \\) as \\( h(z) \\) for us to not be able to tell which one was used.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: For \\( z(T) \\) to be the same regardless of whether \\( h(z) \\) or \\( k(z) \\) was applied, \\( k(z) \\) must also rotate \\( z \\) by \\( \\omega T \\).
