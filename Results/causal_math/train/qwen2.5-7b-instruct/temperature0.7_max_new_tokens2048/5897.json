    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a function \\( z(t) \\) that evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = iAz \\), where \\( A \\) is a real constant.

Applying this transformation to \\( z_0(t) \\) gives us a new function, say \\( w(t) \\), where:\n   \\[\n   w(t) = T(z_0) = \\int_0^t e^{iB(t-s)}z_0 e^{iAs}\\, ds\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Integral**: Simplify the expression inside the integral:\n   \\[\n   w(t) = z_0 \\int_0^t e^{iB(t-s)} e^{iAs}\\, ds = z_0 \\int_0^t e^{i(B-A)s + iBt}\\, ds\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   w(t) = z_0 e^{iBt} \\int_0^t e^{i(B-A)s}\\, ds\n   \\]\n   The integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^t e^{i(B-A)s}\\, ds = \\left[ \\frac{e^{i(B-A)s}}{i(B-A)} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{e^{i(B-A)t} - 1}{i(B-A)}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   w(t) = z_0 e^{iBt} \\cdot \\frac{e^{i(B-A)t} - 1}{i(B-A)} = z_0 \\frac{e^{iAt} - e^{-iAt}}{i(B-A)} = z_0 \\frac{2i \\sin(At)}{i(B-A)} = \\frac{2z_0 \\sin(At)}{B-A}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evolution Under \\( \\dot{z} = iAz \\)**: Now, we need to check if \\( w(t) \\) will evolve identically to \\( z_0(t) \\) under \\( \\dot{z} = iAz \\).
