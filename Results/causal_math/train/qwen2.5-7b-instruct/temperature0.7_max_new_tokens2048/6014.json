We need to determine if we can uniquely find \\( a \\) from \\( G(a) \\) alone, without knowledge of \\( g(z) \\).\n\n2. **Analyzing the Integral Transformation**:\n   - The integral \\( G(a) \\) is essentially a Fourier-like transform, but with the exponential term \\( e^{az} \\).\n   - For \\( G(a) \\) to be uniquely determined, it would imply that each value of \\( a \\) corresponds to a unique \\( G(a) \\), and vice versa.\n\n3. **Uniqueness of \\( a \\)**:\n   - If we knew \\( g(z) \\), we could potentially invert the integral to find \\( a \\). However, without \\( g(z) \\), we lose this direct information.\n   - The function \\( G(a) \\) depends on both \\( a \\) and \\( g(z) \\). Different values of \\( a \\) will generally produce different \\( G(a) \\), but the specific form of \\( g(z) \\) determines exactly which \\( G(a) \\) corresponds to which \\( a \\).\n\n4. **Considering Known Properties**:\n   - Without \\( g(z) \\), there are infinitely many possible functions that could yield any given \\( G(a) \\). Thus, for a given \\( G(a) \\), there is no way to pinpoint a unique \\( a \\) because multiple \\( a \\) values (possibly even continuous ranges) could correspond to the same \\( G(a) \\) for some \\( g(z) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that \\( G(a) \\) is dependent on both \\( a \\) and \\( g(z) \\), and without knowing \\( g(z) \\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\( a \\) based solely on \\( G(a) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral Transformation**: The expression \\( G(a) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{az} g(z) \\, dz \\) represents a Fourier-like transform of the function \\( g(z) \\), but with the exponential term \\( e^{az} \\) instead of \\( e^{-i\\omega z} \\).\n\n2. **Role of \\( a \\)**: Here, \\( a \\) is a complex number.

This means different values of \\( \\sigma \\) (for the same \\( \\omega \\)) can yield the same \\( G(a) \\) when considering the overall scaling effect.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the above points, especially the role of the real part \\( \\sigma \\) in scaling the integral, it is clear that knowing only \\( G(a) \\) does not allow us to uniquely determine \\( a \\).
