    "To determine if we can always uniquely determine the parameters \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\) from the Laplace Transform \\( X(s) \\) of the system's response, let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Differential Equation and Laplace Transform**:\n   The given differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   \\ddot{x} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0\\dot{x} + \\omega_0^2 x = 0\n   \\]\n   Taking the Laplace Transform assuming zero initial conditions, we get:\n   \\[\n   s^2 X(s) + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 s X(s) + \\omega_0^2 X(s) = 0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   X(s) (s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 s + \\omega_0^2) = 0\n   \\]\n   Since \\( X(s) \\neq 0 \\), we obtain the characteristic equation:\n   \\[\n   s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 s + \\omega_0^2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Roots of the Characteristic Equation**:\n   The roots of this quadratic equation are:\n   \\[\n   s = -\\zeta\\omega_0 \\pm \\sqrt{(\\zeta\\omega_0)^2 - \\omega_0^2}\n   \\]\n   For real roots (overdamped case):\n   \\[\n   s_1 = -\\zeta\\omega_0 + j\\omega_d, \\quad s_2 = -\\zeta\\omega_0 - j\\omega_d\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\omega_d = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2} \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   The inverse Laplace Transform of \\( X(s) \\) will give us the time-domain response \\( x(t) \\). The form of \\( x(t) \\) depends on the nature of the roots:\n   - Overdamped: \\( x(t) = e^{-\\zeta\\omega_0 t} [A e^{-\\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}\\omega_0 t} + B e^{\\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - 1}\\omega_0 t}] \\)\n   - Critically damped: \\( x(t) = (C + Dt)e^{-\\zeta\\omega_0 t} \\)\n   - Underdamped: \\( x(t) = e^{-\\zeta\\omega_0 t} [A \\cos(\\omega_d t) + B \\sin(\\omega_d t)] \\)\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Parameters**:\n   From the inverse Laplace Transform, we see that the form of \\( x(t) \\) contains parameters derived from \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\). However, without additional information (such as specific values at certain times or boundary conditions), we cannot uniquely determine both \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\) just from the form of \\( x(t) \\). There could be multiple pairs of \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\) that produce the same form of \\( x(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - The given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.\n   - This describes the motion of a damped harmonic oscillator.\n   - We need to determine if the parameters \\( \\omega_0 \\) (natural frequency) and \\( \\zeta \\) (damping ratio) can be uniquely determined from the Laplace Transform \\( X(s) \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of the Differential Equation:**\n   - Taking the Laplace Transform of the given differential equation:\n     \\[\n     s^2X(s) - sx(0) - \\dot{x}(0) + 2\\zeta\\omega_0(sX(s) - x(0)) + \\omega_0^2X(s) = 0\n     \\]\n   - Assuming zero initial conditions for simplicity (i.e., \\( x(0) = 0 \\) and \\( \\dot{x}(0) = 0 \\)), the equation simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     (s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0s + \\omega_0^2)X(s) = 0\n     \\]\n   - This implies:\n     \\[\n     X(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0s + \\omega_0^2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Inversion of the Laplace Transform:**\n   - The inverse Laplace Transform of \\( X(s) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     x(t) = e^{-\\zeta\\omega_0t} \\left[ \\cos(\\omega_d t) + \\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}} \\sin(\\omega_d t) \\right]\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\omega_d = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\zeta^2} \\) is the damped angular frequency.\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Parameters:**\n   - From the form of \\( X(s) \\), it is clear that the poles of the transfer function are determined by the roots of the characteristic polynomial \\( s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_0s + \\omega_0^2 \\).\n   - These roots are complex conjugates and their real part gives \\( -\\zeta\\omega_0 \\) and imaginary part gives \\( \\pm\\omega_0\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2} \\).\n   - Therefore, knowing \\( X(s) \\) allows us to identify the poles and hence the values of \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the Laplace Transform \\( X(s) \\) contains all the information about the poles of the system, which directly correspond to the parameters \\( \\omega_0 \\) and \\( \\zeta \\), we can indeed uniquely determine these parameters.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
