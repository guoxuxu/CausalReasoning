    "Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation**:\n   The differential equation is given as \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z + cz^2 \\). This is a nonlinear differential equation that describes how \\( z(t) \\) changes over time.\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**:\n   The integral transformation is defined as \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-s}z(s) ds \\). This transformation modifies the original function \\( z(t) \\) into a new function \\( T(z) \\) which integrates the effect of \\( z(s) \\) from 0 to \\( t \\) with a weight factor \\( e^{-s} \\).\n\n3. **Transformed Outcome**:\n   We are given the transformed outcome \\( T(\\tilde{z}(T)) \\) at some \\( T > t_1 \\). The goal is to determine if we can precisely determine the specific values of \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) (which seem to be missing from the problem statement but might be intended as parameters or initial conditions) just by knowing \\( T(\\tilde{z}(T)) \\) and the function type before intervention.\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n   - The differential equation is nonlinear and involves both linear and quadratic terms.\n   - The integral transformation \\( T(z) \\) is a weighted integration of \\( z(s) \\) from 0 to \\( t \\).\n   - Knowing \\( T(\\tilde{z}(T)) \\) gives us information about the cumulative effect of \\( z(t) \\) up to time \\( T \\), but it does not directly provide the specific values of \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) unless they are part of the initial conditions or boundary conditions of the problem.\n   - Without additional information such as initial conditions or specific values of \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\), it is impossible to uniquely determine these values from \\( T(\\tilde{z}(T)) \\) alone.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Since the problem does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the specific values of \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) based solely on \\( T(\\tilde{z}(T)) \\), the answer is no.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
