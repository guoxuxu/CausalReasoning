    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding Impedance**: Impedance in the Laplace domain represents how a circuit will behave in terms of voltage and current relationships for any given input frequency.\n\n2. **Initial Condition**: The initial impedance of the circuit is \\(Z_1(s)\\).\n\n3. **Operational Intervention**: A modification is made to the circuit, changing its impedance to \\(Z_2(s) = Z_1(s) + \\Delta Z(s)\\). This means that \\(\\Delta Z(s)\\) is added to the original impedance \\(Z_1(s)\\).\n\n4. **Response Observation**: We observe the electrical response at time \\(t\\).
