Applying another Fourier transform at \\( t_1 \\) would essentially retransform the solution back to the spatial domain, but this doesn't introduce any new dynamics beyond those already present in \\( L \\).\n\n6. The key point is that the Fourier transforms themselves do not introduce any new terms or dynamics into the system. They are simply tools for analysis and do not alter the fundamental behavior of \\( L \\).\n\n7.

This transformation is a linear operation that decomposes \\( u \\) into its constituent frequencies.\n\n3. **Intervention at Midway Time Point**: An intervention is made by applying an additional Fourier transform at a midway time point \\( t_1 \\).

However, due to the intervention, the state of the system in frequency space has been altered at \\( t_1 \\).\n\n5. **Dependence on \\( L \\)**: The evolution of the system post-intervention still follows the same form \\( u_t = Lu \\). The operator \\( L \\) determines how the function \\( u \\) evolves over time.
