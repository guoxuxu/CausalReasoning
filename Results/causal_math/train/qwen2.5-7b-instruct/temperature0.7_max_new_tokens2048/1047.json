Reflection: \\(F[f(-x)] = (-1)^n F[f(x)]\\) if \\(f(x)\\) is a polynomial of degree \\(n\\). For general functions, it involves complex conjugation.\n     2. Shift: \\(F[f(x - 2c)] = e^{-2\\pi i k 2c} F[f(k)]\\).\n\n6. **Combining the Effects**:\n   - The reflection effect changes the sign of the frequencies for odd functions and introduces a complex conjugate for even functions.\n   - The shift effect adds a phase shift due to the term \\(2c\\).\n\nGiven these steps, the resultant spectrum will not just reflect the initial shift by \\(c\\) but also include the effects of the reflection and the additional shift by \\(2c\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

Instead, the spectrum undergoes a more complex transformation due to the reflection and additional shift.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The resultant spectrum will not simply reflect the initial shift by \\(c\\) because the application of \\(N\\) introduces a reflection and an additional shift, altering the spectrum in a way that is not purely a shift.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
