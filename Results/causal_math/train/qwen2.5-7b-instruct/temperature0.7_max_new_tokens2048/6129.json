It only provides an additional integral term that represents the accumulated effect of \\(z(t) + c\\) over time.\n\n4. **Initial Condition Influence**: The initial condition \\(z(0)\\) directly influences the value of \\(z(t)\\) at any time \\(t\\), because it serves as the starting point for the evolution governed by \\(\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\).\n\n5. **Role of \\(c\\)**: The constant \\(c\\) also plays a role in the differential equation, influencing the rate of change of \\(z(t)\\) at every moment. However, \\(c\\) is fixed and does not depend on \\(z(t)\\) itself.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the system evolves according to \\(\\dot{z} = z^2 + c\\) and \\(c\\) is a constant, the future state of \\(z(t)\\) at any time \\(t = T\\) depends solely on the initial condition \\(z(0)\\) and the constant \\(c\\).
