    "To determine if we can uniquely determine the original potential \\(\\phi(x, y)\\) from the modified potential \\(\\phi'(x, y) = \\phi(x, y) + \\sin(x + y)\\), let's reason through this step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Transformation**: The transformation given is \\(g(\\phi) = \\phi + \\sin(x + y)\\). This means that at any point \\((x, y)\\), the new potential \\(\\phi'(x, y)\\) is the original potential \\(\\phi(x, y)\\) plus \\(\\sin(x + y)\\).\n\n2. **Express the Original Potential**: From the transformation, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\phi'(x, y) = \\phi(x, y) + \\sin(x + y)\n   \\]\n   To find \\(\\phi(x, y)\\), we rearrange this equation:\n   \\[\n   \\phi(x, y) = \\phi'(x, y) - \\sin(x + y)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Check for Uniqueness**: The expression \\(\\phi(x, y) = \\phi'(x, y) - \\sin(x + y)\\) provides a clear and unique way to determine \\(\\phi(x, y)\\) from \\(\\phi'(x, y)\\). Since \\(\\sin(x + y)\\) is a known function, subtracting it from \\(\\phi'(x, y)\\) directly gives us \\(\\phi(x, y)\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the modified potential \\(\\phi'(x, y)\\) and the knowledge of the transformation \\(\\sin(x + y)\\), we can indeed uniquely determine the original potential \\(\\phi(x, y)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
