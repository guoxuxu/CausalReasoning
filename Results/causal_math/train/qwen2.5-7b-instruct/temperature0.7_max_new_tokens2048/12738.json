Let’s denote the transformed function after this operation as \\(Z'(f)\\):\n   \\[\n   Z'(f) = g(f) \\cdot Z(f) = g(f) \\cdot 2\\pi \\delta(f - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   Since the Dirac delta function \\(\\delta(f - \\omega)\\) is non-zero only at \\(f = \\omega\\), the product simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   Z'(f) = 2\\pi g(\\omega) \\delta(f - \\omega)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To recover the function at time \\(T > t_1\\), we apply the inverse Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\) to \\(Z'(f)\\):\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{2\\pi g(\\omega) \\delta(f - \\omega)\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the inverse Fourier transform, this becomes:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = 2\\pi g(\\omega) e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Recovery at Time \\(T\\)**: When we recover the function at time \\(T\\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = 2\\pi g(\\omega) e^{i\\omega T}\n   \\]\n\nFrom the above steps, it is clear that the function recovered at time \\(T\\) depends not only on the original frequency \\(\\omega\\) but also on the value of \\(g(\\omega)\\). Therefore, the recovery at time \\(T\\) is influenced by the operation performed in the frequency domain.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), which is a simple complex exponential with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) to \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   Z(f) = \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-2\\pi i f t} dt = \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( Z(f) \\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\( f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\).\n\n3. **Operation in Frequency Domain**: At time \\( t_1 \\), an operation such as multiplication by a function \\( g(t) \\) is performed in the frequency domain. This corresponds to convolution in the time domain. Let \\( G(f) \\) be the Fourier transform of \\( g(t) \\). The new frequency domain representation is:\n   \\[\n   Z'(f) = G(f) \\cdot Z(f) = G(f) \\cdot \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find the function \\( z'(t) \\) in the time domain, we apply the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{Z'(f)\\} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{G(f) \\cdot \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\\}\n   \\]\n   Since the Dirac delta function picks out the value of \\( G(f) \\) at \\( f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\):\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{G(\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}) \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\\} = G(\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Recovery at Time \\( T \\)**: Now, we need to determine if the function recovered at time \\( T > t_1 \\) depends solely on the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) of \\( z(t) \\). From the above, we have:\n   \\[\n   z'(T) = G(\\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}) \\cdot e^{i\\omega T}\n   \\]\n   Clearly, \\( z'(T) \\) depends not only on \\( \\omega \\) but also on the value of \\( G(f) \\) at \\( f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\).\n\nTherefore, the function recovered at time \\( T \\) does not depend solely on the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) of \\( z(t) \\), but also on the value of \\( g(t) \\) at the corresponding frequency.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is given by \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). This represents a simple sinusoidal wave with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) to \\( z(t) \\):\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a delta function \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\Omega) \\), where \\( \\Omega \\) is the frequency corresponding to the exponential term.\n\n3. **Operation in Frequency Domain**: At time \\( t_1 \\), an operation (multiplication by a function \\( g(t) \\)) is applied in the frequency domain. This modifies the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) to:\n   - \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\} \\cdot g(\\omega) = \\delta(\\omega - \\Omega) \\cdot g(\\omega) \\)\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To recover the function in the time domain, we apply the inverse Fourier transform:\n   - The inverse Fourier transform of \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\Omega) \\cdot g(\\omega) \\) is \\( g(t) \\cdot e^{i\\Omega t} \\).\n   - This means that after the operation in the frequency domain, the function in the time domain is \\( z'(t) = g(t) \\cdot e^{i\\Omega t} \\).\n\n5. **Recovery at Time \\( T \\)**: We need to determine if the function recovered at time \\( T > t_1 \\) depends solely on the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n   - From the above, the function at time \\( T \\) is \\( z'(T) = g(T) \\cdot e^{i\\Omega T} \\).\n   - Here, \\( \\Omega \\) is the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**: The recovered function \\( z'(T) \\) at time \\( T \\) includes the factor \\( g(T) \\), which is dependent on the specific form of the function \\( g(t) \\). Therefore, the recovered function does not solely depend on the original frequency \\( \\omega \\); it also depends on the values of \\( g(t) \\) at time \\( T \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the function recovered at time \\( T > t_1 \\) does not solely depend on the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
