    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The given function is \\(z(t) = e^{(\\lambda+i\\omega)t}\\).

    "To determine if we can deduce the parameters \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\omega\\) from \\(Z(s)\\), let's go through the steps of applying the Laplace transform to \\(z(t)\\).\n\n1. **Laplace Transform of \\(z(t)\\):**\n   The given function is \\(z(t) = e^{(\\lambda + i\\omega)t}\\). The Laplace transform of \\(z(t)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(\\lambda + i\\omega)t} e^{-st} dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the exponent:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{((\\lambda + i\\omega) - s)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Evaluating the Integral:**\n   This integral converges if \\(\\text{Re}((\\lambda + i\\omega) - s) < 0\\), which means \\(\\text{Re}(\\lambda + i\\omega) < \\text{Re}(s)\\). Assuming this condition holds, the integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{((\\lambda + i\\omega) - s)t}}{(\\lambda + i\\omega) - s} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n   \\]\n   Evaluating the limits, we get:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - (\\lambda + i\\omega)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Deducing \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\omega\\):**\n   From the expression for \\(Z(s)\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - (\\lambda + i\\omega)}\n   \\]\n   To find \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\omega\\), we need to express \\(Z(s)\\) in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let \\(s = \\sigma + i\\gamma\\), then:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{1}{(\\sigma + i\\gamma) - (\\lambda + i\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{(\\sigma - \\lambda) + i(\\gamma - \\omega)}\n   \\]\n   To extract \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\omega\\), we would typically look at the poles of \\(Z(s)\\). The poles of \\(Z(s)\\) are the values of \\(s\\) that make the denominator zero, i.e., \\((\\sigma - \\lambda) + i(\\gamma - \\omega) = 0\\). This gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\sigma = \\lambda \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\gamma = \\omega\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   By examining the poles of \\(Z(s)\\), we can directly deduce \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\omega\\). Therefore, it is indeed possible to deduce these parameters from \\(Z(s)\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The given function is \\(z(t) = e^{(\\lambda + i\\omega)t}\\). This is an exponential function with both real and imaginary parts.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\(z(t)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s - (\\lambda + i\\omega))t} dt\n   \\]\n   where \\(s\\) is a complex variable.\n\n3. **Simplifying the Integral**: For the integral to converge, the real part of \\(s - (\\lambda + i\\omega)\\) must be positive. Let \\(s = \\sigma + i\\beta\\), then:\n   \\[\n   s - (\\lambda + i\\omega) = (\\sigma - \\lambda) + i(\\beta - \\omega)\n   \\]\n   The integral converges if \\(\\sigma > \\lambda\\).\n\n4. **Evaluating the Integral**: Assuming \\(\\sigma > \\lambda\\), we can evaluate the integral:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-(s - (\\lambda + i\\omega))t}}{-(s - (\\lambda + i\\omega))} \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{s - (\\lambda + i\\omega)}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Inverting the Laplace Transform**: To find \\(z(t)\\) from \\(Z(s)\\), we use the inverse Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s - (\\lambda + i\\omega)} \\right\\}\n   \\]\n   By the properties of the Laplace transform, this corresponds to:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{(\\lambda + i\\omega)t}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Deducing Parameters**: From the expression \\(Z(s) = \\frac{1}{s - (\\lambda + i\\omega)}\\), we can see that the poles of \\(Z(s)\\) are at \\(s = \\lambda + i\\omega\\). Therefore, the parameters \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\omega\\) can be directly read off from the pole of the Laplace transform.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can indeed deduce the parameters \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\omega\\) from the Laplace transform \\(Z(s)\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
