    "To address the question, let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. **Understand the original function**: The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\), where \\( a \\) is a complex constant and \\( t \\) is a real variable.\n\n2. **Apply the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{at} dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{(a-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n   For this integral to converge, the real part of \\( a - s \\) must be negative.
