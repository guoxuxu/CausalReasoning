    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Equation Analysis**:\n   The given PDE is \\( U_{xx} = -\\lambda U \\). This is a second-order linear homogeneous PDE with constant coefficients. Its general solution involves exponential functions of the form \\( U(x,t) = A e^{i\\sqrt{\\lambda}x} + B e^{-i\\sqrt{\\lambda}x} \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**:\n   Applying the Fourier transform over space results in \\( \\hat{U}(k,t) \\). The Fourier transform of \\( U(x,t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}(k,t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} U(x,t) e^{-ikx} dx\n   \\]\n   For the given PDE, the Fourier transform yields a simpler form because the spatial derivatives transform into multiplications by \\( ik \\):\n   \\[\n   (ik)^2 \\hat{U}(k,t) = -\\lambda \\hat{U}(k,t)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   -k^2 \\hat{U}(k,t) = -\\lambda \\hat{U}(k,t)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k^2 = \\lambda\n   \\]\n\n3. **Influence of \\( G(k) \\)**:\n   If \\( G(k) = e^{-\\alpha k^2 t} \\) is applied, it modifies \\( \\hat{U}(k,t) \\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}(k,t) \\rightarrow \\hat{U}(k,t) e^{-\\alpha k^2 t}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Analyzing \\( \\hat{U}(k,T) \\)**:\n   At time \\( t = T \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{U}(k,T) = \\hat{U}(k,0) e^{-\\alpha k^2 T}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\hat{U}(k,0) \\) contains information about \\( \\lambda \\) from the initial condition. However, the factor \\( e^{-\\alpha k^2 T} \\) is also present.\n\n5. **Determining \\( \\lambda \\) and \\( G(k) \\)**:\n   - To determine \\( \\lambda \\) uniquely, we need to know \\( \\hat{U}(k,0) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\). This would give us \\( k^2 = \\lambda \\).\n   - Determining if \\( G(k) \\) was applied requires comparing \\( \\hat{U}(k,T) \\) with the expected form without \\( G(k) \\). The presence of \\( e^{-\\alpha k^2 T} \\) indicates that \\( G(k) \\) was indeed applied.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - We can uniquely ascertain \\( \\lambda \\) from \\( \\hat{U}(k,0) \\).\n   - We can confirm whether \\( G(k) \\) was applied by checking the presence of \\( e^{-\\alpha k^2 T} \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, we can uniquely ascertain both the value of \\( \\lambda \\) and whether \\( G(k) \\) was applied during the evolution.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
