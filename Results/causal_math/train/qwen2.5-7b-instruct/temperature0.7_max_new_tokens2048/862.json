The Laplace transform of \\( f(t) \\) results in \\( F(s) \\), where \\( s \\) is a complex number.\n\n3. **Transformed Domain**: In the transformed domain (frequency domain), the Laplace transform typically deals with functions of a single variable \\( s \\). If \\( f(t) \\) was originally a function of multiple variables (like \\( x \\) and \\( y \\)), the transformation process does not inherently preserve the multi-variable nature.

    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function and Transform**: \n   - The function \\( z = f(x, y) \\) is defined over the complex plane with \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) being real numbers.\n   - The Laplace transform is applied to this function, resulting in \\( F(s) = \\mathcal{L}(f(t)) \\). Note that here, it seems there might be a mix-up because typically the Laplace transform is used for functions of time \\( t \\), not directly for spatial variables \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). However, let's assume the intention was to apply the Laplace transform to a function of \\( x \\) (or \\( t \\)) while keeping \\( y \\) as a parameter.\n\n2. **Implication of Laplace Transform**:\n   - If the Laplace transform is applied to a function of \\( x \\), say \\( g(x) \\), then the result \\( G(s) \\) will be independent of \\( y \\) unless \\( y \\) is explicitly included in \\( g(x) \\).\n\n3. **Dependency on \\( y \\)**:\n   - For \\( y \\) to have any effect on the Laplace transform \\( F(s) \\), \\( y \\) would need to influence the function \\( f(x) \\) in such a way that it changes the behavior of \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) varies.\n   - If \\( y \\) is a constant or does not affect \\( f(x) \\), then the Laplace transform of \\( f(x) \\) would be the same regardless of \\( y \\).\n   - If \\( y \\) influences \\( f(x) \\), then the form of \\( F(s) \\) would change depending on \\( y \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without additional information about how \\( y \\) affects \\( f(x) \\), it is impossible to determine if there were dependencies on \\( y \\) in the original function just from \\( F(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

This means that \\( f(x, y) \\) could potentially depend on both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Application**: When we apply the Laplace transform to \\( f(x) \\), we are essentially transforming the function with respect to one of its variables (let's assume it's \\( x \\) for simplicity). The Laplace transform of \\( f(x) \\) with respect to \\( x \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(x)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-sx} f(x) dx\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( s \\) is a complex variable. However, the Laplace transform is taken with respect to \\( x \\) only, and the result \\( F(s) \\) is a function of \\( s \\).\n\n3. **Dependency on \\( y \\)**: Since the Laplace transform is applied with respect to \\( x \\) alone, any dependency on \\( y \\) in the original function \\( f(x, y) \\) does not directly influence the form of \\( F(s) \\).
