    "To determine if we can precisely determine the original charge density \\(\\rho\\) configuration from the Fourier transform of the potential field \\(\\phi\\), let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Original Equation**: The given equation is \\(-\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\rho\\). This relates the charge density \\(\\rho\\) to the Laplacian of the potential field \\(\\phi\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   F(-\\nabla^2 \\phi) = F(\\rho)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(F\\) denotes the Fourier transform.\n\n3. **Properties of Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier transform of the Laplacian \\(\\nabla^2 \\phi\\) is \\((-\\mathbf{k}^2) \\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{k})\\), where \\(\\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{k})\\) is the Fourier transform of \\(\\phi(\\mathbf{x})\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(F(-\\nabla^2 \\phi) = (-\\mathbf{k}^2) \\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{k})\\).\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find \\(\\rho\\) from \\(\\hat{\\rho}(\\mathbf{k})\\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{\\rho}(\\mathbf{k}) = -(-\\mathbf{k}^2) \\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{k})\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\hat{\\rho}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathbf{k}^2 \\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{k})\n   \\]\n\n5. **Reconstructing \\(\\rho\\)**: The inverse Fourier transform of \\(\\hat{\\rho}(\\mathbf{k})\\) will give us \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x})\\):\n   \\[\n   \\rho(\\mathbf{x}) = F^{-1}[\\mathbf{k}^2 \\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{k})]\n   \\]\n\n6. **Inversion Theorem**: The inversion theorem for the Fourier transform states that if \\(\\hat{\\rho}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathbf{k}^2 \\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{k})\\), then \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{x})\\) can be reconstructed uniquely from \\(\\hat{\\rho}(\\mathbf{k})\\).\n\nGiven these steps, we can indeed determine the original charge density \\(\\rho\\) configuration from the Fourier transform of the potential field \\(\\phi\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
