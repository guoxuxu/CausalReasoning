    "To determine whether a change in transition rates from \\(Q\\) to \\(Q'\\) occurred and when, we need to analyze the state-transition matrices \\(\\phi(t) = e^{Qt}\\) and \\(\\phi'(t) = e^{Q't}\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **State-Transition Matrices**: The state-transition matrix \\(\\phi(t)\\) describes how the probability distribution of states evolves over time under the transition rate matrix \\(Q\\). Similarly, \\(\\phi'(t)\\) does the same but under \\(Q'\\).\n\n2. **Initial Condition**: We know the state probabilities at \\(t = T\\), denoted as \\(P(T)\\).\n\n3. **Backward Inference**:\n   - If there was no change in transition rates, then \\(\\phi(T)\\) and \\(\\phi'(T)\\) should be the same.\n   - A change in transition rates would result in different \\(\\phi(T)\\) and \\(\\phi'(T)\\).\n\n4. **Determining the Change**:\n   - To determine if a change occurred, we need to compare \\(\\phi(T)\\) with \\(\\phi'(T)\\).\n   - If they differ, we need to find the time \\(t_c\\) at which the transition rate changed from \\(Q\\) to \\(Q'\\).\n\n5. **Mathematical Formulation**:\n   - For \\(t < t_c\\), the state transition is governed by \\(Q\\).\n   - For \\(t \\geq t_c\\), the state transition is governed by \\(Q'\\).\n   - This implies that \\(\\phi(t) = e^{Qt}\\) for \\(t < t_c\\) and \\(\\phi'(t) = e^{Q't}\\) for \\(t \\geq t_c\\).\n\n6. **Reconstructing the History**:\n   - Given \\(P(T)\\), we can try to reconstruct the history of the process up to \\(T\\).\n   - We need to find a time \\(t_c\\) such that the solution matches the observed probabilities at \\(T\\).\n\n7. **Uniqueness and Identifiability**:\n   - The problem of determining \\(t_c\\) and the exact form of \\(Q'\\) from \\(P(T)\\) is generally not unique without additional information.\n   - However, if we assume certain properties about \\(Q\\) and \\(Q'\\) (e.g., they are known forms or have specific differences), it might be possible to identify the change point and the new transition rates.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWithout additional constraints or information about the nature of the change in transition rates, it is not possible to unequivocally determine both the occurrence of the change and the exact timing of the change just from the state probabilities at \\(t = T\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs):**\n   - CTMCs describe systems that change states continuously over time.\n   - The transition rate matrix \\(Q\\) determines the instantaneous rates at which the system transitions between states.\n\n2. **State-Transition Matrix:**\n   - Given \\(Q\\), the state-transition matrix \\(\\phi(t) = e^{Qt}\\) describes how the probabilities of being in each state evolve over time \\(t\\).\n\n3. **State Probabilities at Time \\(T\\):**\n   - If we know the state probabilities at time \\(T\\), we can use \\(\\phi(T) = e^{QT}\\) to find these probabilities.\n   - However, knowing the probabilities at one specific time does not uniquely determine the transition rate matrix \\(Q\\). Multiple different \\(Q\\) matrices could result in the same probabilities at \\(T\\).\n\n4. **Change in Transition Rates:**\n   - A change from \\(Q\\) to \\(Q'\\) would imply a different set of transition rates.\n   - To detect such a change, we would need to observe the state probabilities at multiple times or have additional information about the system's behavior over time.\n\n5. **Determining When a Change Occurred:**\n   - Without knowing the exact form of \\(Q'\\) or having multiple data points, it is impossible to pinpoint exactly when the transition rates changed from \\(Q\\) to \\(Q'\\).\n   - We would need a sequence of state probability measurements over time to infer any changes in the transition rates.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given only the state probabilities at a single time \\(T\\), it is not possible to unequivocally determine if a change in transition rates occurred or when it happened.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
