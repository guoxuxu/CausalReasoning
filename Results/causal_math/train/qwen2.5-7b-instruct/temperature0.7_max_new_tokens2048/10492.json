If we only consider this function without any transformation, then:\n\\[ z(T) = e^{kT} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Transformation\nWhen the transformation \\( h(z) = z^m \\) is applied, it modifies the system dynamics as follows:\n\\[ z(t) = (e^{kt})^m = e^{kmt} \\]\nThus, the state at time \\( T \\) becomes:\n\\[ z(T) = e^{kmt} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Two Scenarios\n- Without transformation: \\( z(T) = e^{kT} \\)\n- With transformation: \\( z(T) = e^{kmt} \\)\n\nFrom these expressions, we can see that the form of \\( z(T) \\) changes based on whether the transformation \\( h(z) \\) is applied or not.
