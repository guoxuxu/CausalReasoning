    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Define the Function \\(z(t)\\):**\n   \\[ z(t) = e^{iAt} w \\]\n   Here, \\(A\\) is a real constant, and \\(w\\) is a constant complex vector.\n\n2. **Define the Integral Transformation \\(I(z)\\):**\n   \\[ I(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{iB\\tau} z(\\tau) d\\tau \\]\n   Substituting \\(z(\\tau)\\):\n   \\[ I(z) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{iB\\tau} e^{iA\\tau} w \\, d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{i(A+B)\\tau} w \\, d\\tau \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the Integral:**\n   The integral can be evaluated as follows:\n   \\[ I(z) = w \\int_{0}^{t} e^{i(A+B)\\tau} d\\tau = w \\left[ \\frac{e^{i(A+B)\\tau}}{i(A+B)} \\right]_{0}^{t} \\]\n   \\[ I(z) = w \\left( \\frac{e^{i(A+B)t} - 1}{i(A+B)} \\right) \\]\n\n4. **Analyze the Impact of \\(B\\):**\n   From the expression for \\(I(z)\\), we see that \\(B\\) directly influences the term \\(e^{i(A+B)t}\\). This means that the value of \\(I(z)\\) depends on both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n5. **Impact on the Final State of \\(z(T)\\):**\n   The final state of \\(z(T)\\) is given by:\n   \\[ z(T) = e^{iAT} w \\]\n   The integral transformation \\(I(z)\\) does not affect the final state of \\(z(T)\\) directly because \\(I(z)\\) is computed over the interval from \\(0\\) to \\(T\\), but it does not alter the function \\(z(t)\\) at time \\(T\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The final state of \\(z(T)\\) is determined solely by the parameters \\(A\\) and \\(w\\), and not by \\(B\\). The integral transformation \\(I(z)\\) affects the intermediate states of \\(z(t)\\) but does not change the final state \\(z(T)\\).\n\nTherefore, the final state of \\(z(T)\\) solely depends on \\(A\\) and not on \\(B\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
