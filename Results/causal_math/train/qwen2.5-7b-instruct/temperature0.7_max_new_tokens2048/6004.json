    "To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the State Function Transformation:**\n   - The state function after transformation by \\( U(t) \\) would be \\( U(T) \\psi(T) \\).\n   - The transformation \\( U(t) = e^{-iBt} \\) implies that \\( U(T) = e^{-iBT} \\).\n\n2. **Identifying the Transformations:**\n   - The problem mentions two types of transformations: \\( U \\) and \\( G \\).
