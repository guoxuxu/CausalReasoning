    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Definition of the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\) is defined as \\(\\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt\\).\n\n2. **Effect of Multiplying by \\(e^{at}\\)**: If we have \\(h(t) = e^{at} f(t)\\), then the Laplace transform of \\(h(t)\\) can be derived as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(h)(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} h(t) dt = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{at} f(t) dt = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-(s-a)t} f(t) dt.\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Transformation Property**: Notice that the integral above is equivalent to the Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\) evaluated at \\(s-a\\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(h)(s) = \\mathcal{L}(f)(s-a).\n   \\]\n\n4. **Recovering \\(f(t)\\)**: To determine if \\(f(t)\\) can be recovered without knowing \\(a\\), consider the inverse Laplace transform.

The inverse Laplace transform does not provide a unique solution for \\(a\\) because shifting the argument of the Laplace transform by \\(a\\) changes the function but does not specify \\(a\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about \\(a\\), it is impossible to uniquely recover \\(f(t)\\) from \\(h(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
