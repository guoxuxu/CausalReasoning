Applying \\(T(x)\\) to the initial condition \\(x(0)\\) results in a new state \\(x(T_1) = e^{i\\theta}x(0)\\) at time \\(t_1\\).\n   - Since \\(Lx = \\lambda x\\), applying the operator \\(L\\) to the transformed state gives \\(L(e^{i\\theta}x) = e^{i\\theta}Lx = \\lambda e^{i\\theta}x\\). This shows that the eigenvalue remains \\(\\lambda\\), but the state is scaled by \\(e^{i\\theta}\\).\n\n2. **Subsequent Transformation \\(S(x)\\):**\n   - At time \\(t_1\\), the intervention \\(S(x) = e^{i\\phi}x\\) is applied. This further transforms the state \\(x(t_1) = e^{i\\theta}x(0)\\) into \\(x(t_2) = e^{i\\phi}e^{i\\theta}x(0) = e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}x(0)\\) at some later time \\(t_2 > t_1\\).\n   - The operator \\(L\\) continues to act on the state, resulting in \\(L(e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}x) = e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}Lx = \\lambda e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}x\\).\n\n3. **Effect on the Endpoint \\(x(T)\\):**\n   - For \\(T > t_1\\), the state evolves according to \\(Lx = \\lambda x\\), which means the endpoint \\(x(T)\\) will be determined by the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) and the initial conditions modified by the cumulative effect of the transformations.\n   - Specifically, if we consider the endpoint \\(x(T)\\) after applying both transformations, it will be \\(x(T) = e^{i(\\phi + \\theta)}x(0)\\). This expression depends on both \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\), indicating that the endpoint does indeed depend on these constants.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the endpoint \\(x(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) does depend on both \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
