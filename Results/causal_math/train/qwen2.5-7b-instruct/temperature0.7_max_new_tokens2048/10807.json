This is a simple exponential decay in time.\n\n4. **Intermediate Transformation (Laplace Transform)**: At some intermediate time \\( t_1 \\), we apply the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L} \\) to the transformed temperature distribution \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\). This results in another transformed representation, say \\( \\tilde{u}(s,k) \\).\n\n5. **Recovery Process**: To recover the temperature profile at a later time \\( t > t_1 \\), we need to reverse the process. First, we would need to apply the inverse Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\) to \\( \\tilde{u}(s,k) \\) to get back to \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\) at the intermediate time \\( t_1 \\). Then, we would need to evolve this distribution forward in time using the heat equation in frequency space to get \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\) at the desired time \\( t \\). Finally, we would apply the inverse Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\) to obtain \\( u(x,t) \\).\n\n6. **Feasibility of Recovery**: The key point here is whether the information lost by transforming from Fourier to Laplace and back can be fully recovered. Since the Laplace transform is a one-to-one mapping for functions that decay sufficiently fast, if the original function (in this case, \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\)) is known at \\( t_1 \\) and decays appropriately, the inverse Laplace transform will indeed give us \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\) at any later time \\( t \\). Once we have \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\), applying the inverse Fourier transform will yield \\( u(x,t) \\).\n\nGiven these steps, the answer is that it is theoretically possible to recover the ultimate temperature profile at any later time \\( t > t_1 \\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform after the necessary transformations.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
