    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The given linear operator \\(L[f(z)]\\) represents the Laplace transform of the function \\(f(z)\\). For the specific function \\(f(z) = e^z\\), the Laplace transform is:\n   \\[\n   L[e^z] = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^t dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(1-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges if the real part of \\(s\\) (denoted as Re(s)) is greater than 1.

The inverse Laplace transform \\(L^{-1}\\) is defined such that:\n   \\[\n   f(z) = L^{-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{s-1} \\right)\n   \\]\n   It is known that the inverse Laplace transform of \\(\\frac{1}{s-1}\\) is indeed \\(e^z\\) under certain conditions, specifically when \\(z\\) is in the region of convergence for the original function.\n\n3. **Conditions for Reversibility**: The key point here is that the Laplace transform is a one-to-one mapping from the space of functions to the space of complex functions under appropriate conditions. However, the inverse Laplace transform is not unique without specifying the region of convergence and the original function form. In this case, the original function \\(f(z) = e^z\\) is uniquely determined from its Laplace transform \\(\\frac{1}{s-1}\\) within the specified domain (Re(s) > 1).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that the Laplace transform of \\(f(z) = e^z\\) results in a unique and invertible form, and knowing the result of \\(L[f(z)]\\) allows us to identify the original function form \\(f(z) = e^z\\) up to the specified conditions.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
