    "To address this question, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Understand the Transformation**: The transformation \\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\) maps points from the w-plane to a new contour in the complex plane. This transformation is non-linear and depends on both the magnitude and phase of \\( w \\).\n\n2. **Integral Under Transformation**: The integral of \\( z(w) \\) along the contour \\( C \\) is transformed when \\( T(w) \\) is applied. If \\( C' \\) is the image of \\( C \\) under \\( T \\), then the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{C'} z(T^{-1}(w')) dw' = \\int_{C'} (T^{-1}(w'))^2 + 2i(T^{-1}(w')) dT^{-1}(w')\n   \\]\n   where \\( w' \\) is the new variable of integration corresponding to the transformed contour.\n\n3. **Invertibility of \\( T(w) \\)**: For \\( T(w) \\) to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one (injective). However, \\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\) is not one-to-one over the entire complex plane due to its periodic nature in the argument of \\( w \\). This means that multiple values of \\( w \\) can map to the same value under \\( T \\), making it difficult to uniquely determine \\( C \\) from \\( C' \\).\n\n4. **Implication for Inference**: Given that \\( T(w) \\) is not one-to-one and can introduce multiple pre-images for each point in the transformed contour, it is not possible to precisely reconstruct the original contour \\( C \\) from the transformed contour \\( C' \\) without additional information about the specific form of \\( T(w) \\) and the original contour \\( C \\).\n\nBased on these considerations, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

The new contour \\( C' \\) is not necessarily the same as the original contour \\( C \\); it depends on the specific form of \\( T(w) \\).\n\n3. **Integral Consideration**: The integral \\( \\int_C z(w) dw \\) is computed along the original contour \\( C \\).

The integral alone does not provide enough information to reverse the transformation and reconstruct the original path.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about the transformation \\( T(w) \\), we cannot infer the precise original contour \\( C \\) from the transformed integral.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
