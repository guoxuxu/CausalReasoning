The term \\(-\\lambda U(s)\\) will still be present in the transformed equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original System**: The given partial differential equation (PDE) is \\(\\nabla^2 u = -\\lambda u\\). This equation describes a system where the Laplacian of \\(u\\) is proportional to \\(-\\lambda u\\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: Applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}[\\nabla^2 u](s) = \\mathcal{L}[-\\lambda u](s)\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Laplace transform for the Laplacian operator, we have:\n   \\[\n   (\\nabla^2 U)(s) = -\\lambda U(s)\n   \\]\n   Therefore, in the Laplace domain, the transformed PDE is:\n   \\[\n   \\nabla^2 U(s) + \\lambda U(s) = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perturbation**: A perturbation is introduced by multiplying \\(u(t)\\) by \\(e^{\\alpha x}\\) at time \\(t = t_0\\). In the Laplace domain, this perturbation modifies \\(U(s)\\) such that it no longer satisfies the homogeneous equation \\(\\nabla^2 U(s) + \\lambda U(s) = 0\\).\n\n4. **Effect of Perturbation**: The perturbation \\(e^{\\alpha x}\\) at \\(t = t_0\\) introduces a non-homogeneous term into the transformed equation. This means the new equation in the Laplace domain would be something like:\n   \\[\n   \\nabla^2 U'(s) + \\lambda U'(s) = F(x)\n   \\]\n   where \\(F(x)\\) represents the effect of the perturbation in the Laplace domain.\n\n5. **Independence from \\(\\lambda\\)**: The presence of the perturbation \\(e^{\\alpha x}\\) at \\(t = t_0\\) introduces a new term \\(F(x)\\) which depends on the spatial variable \\(x\\). This term is not directly proportional to \\(\\lambda\\). Therefore, the resulting system in the Laplace domain will not be entirely independent of \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the resulting system in the Laplace domain will not be entirely independent of the original \\(\\lambda\\) parameter.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
