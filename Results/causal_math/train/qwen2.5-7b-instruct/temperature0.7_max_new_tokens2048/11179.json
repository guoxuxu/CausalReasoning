This changes the state from \\( z(t_1) \\) to:\n   \\[\n   z(t_1+) = Fe^{Gt_1}z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( z(t_1) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t_1+) = Fe^{Gt_1}Ce^{Dt_1}z(t_1-)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Post-intervention Dynamics**: After the intervention, the system continues to evolve according to the original dynamics \\( z(t) = e^{At}z \\). Therefore, for \\( t > t_1 \\), the state is:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{A(T - t_1)}z(t_1+)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( z(t_1+) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{A(T - t_1)}Fe^{Gt_1}Ce^{Dt_1}z(t_1-)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final State Expression**: Simplifying the expression for \\( z(T) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{A(T - t_1)}Fe^{Gt_1}Ce^{Dt_1}z(t_1-)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The term \\( e^{A(T - t_1)} \\) depends solely on matrix \\( A \\).\n   - The term \\( Fe^{Gt_1} \\) depends on matrices \\( F \\) and \\( G \\).\n   - The term \\( Ce^{Dt_1} \\) depends on matrices \\( C \\) and \\( D \\).\n   - The initial state just before the intervention \\( z(t_1-) \\) depends on the initial conditions and possibly other factors not specified here.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the final state \\( z(T) \\) does indeed depend on matrices \\( F \\) and \\( G \\) through the term \\( Fe^{Gt_1} \\), and it also depends on matrices \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) through the term \\( Ce^{Dt_1} \\).

    "Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State and Transformation:**\n   - The initial state of the system is \\( z_0 \\).\n   - The system evolves over time according to \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\):**\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention is applied using the function \\( g(z) = Fe^{Gt}z \\).\n   - This intervention modifies the state of the system from \\( z(t_1) \\) to \\( z(t_1^+) \\).\n\n3. **Post-Intervention Evolution:**\n   - After the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the system continues to evolve according to the original dynamics but starting from the new state \\( z(t_1^+) \\).\n   - The evolution after \\( t_1 \\) can be described as:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}z(t_1^+)\n     \\]\n\n4. **State at \\( t_1 \\):**\n   - Before the intervention, the state at \\( t_1 \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     z(t_1) = e^{At_1}z_0\n     \\]\n   - The intervention modifies this state to:\n     \\[\n     z(t_1^+) = Fe^{Gt_1}z(t_1) = Fe^{Gt_1}e^{At_1}z_0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Final State at \\( T \\):**\n   - Substituting \\( z(t_1^+) \\) into the post-intervention evolution equation:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}Fe^{Gt_1}e^{At_1}z_0\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the exponentials:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}Fe^{Gt_1}e^{At_1}z_0 = e^{A(T-t_1)}Fe^{Gt_1 + At_1}z_0\n     \\]\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis:**\n   - From the expression \\( z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}Fe^{Gt_1 + At_1}z_0 \\), we see that \\( z(T) \\) depends on both the original matrix \\( A \\) and the matrices \\( F \\) and \\( G \\) through the term \\( Fe^{Gt_1 + At_1} \\).\n   - The matrices \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) do not appear in the final expression for \\( z(T) \\).\n\nGiven the analysis above, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) does depend on matrices \\( A \\), \\( F \\), and \\( G \\).
