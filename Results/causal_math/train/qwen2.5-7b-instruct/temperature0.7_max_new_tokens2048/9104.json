    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The function \\(z(w)\\) is defined as a Fourier transform of \\(f(x)\\). Specifically, \\(z(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwx} f(x) \\, dx\\).\n\n2. **Scalar Modifications to \\(f(x)\\)**: Suppose we modify \\(f(x)\\) by multiplying it with scalar values \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Let's consider two cases:\n   - Multiplying \\(f(x)\\) by a constant \\(a\\): \\(f(x) \\rightarrow af(x)\\).\n   - Multiplying \\(f(x)\\) by another constant \\(b\\): \\(f(x) \\rightarrow bf(x)\\).\n\n3. **Effect on the Fourier Transform**:\n   - If \\(f(x)\\) is modified to \\(af(x)\\), then the new Fourier transform would be:\n     \\[\n     z_a(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwx} (af(x)) \\, dx = a \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwx} f(x) \\, dx = az(w)\n     \\]\n   - If \\(f(x)\\) is modified to \\(bf(x)\\), then the new Fourier transform would be:\n     \\[\n     z_b(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwx} (bf(x)) \\, dx = b \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iwx} f(x) \\, dx = bz(w)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determining the Nature of Modifications**:\n   - From the above, we see that if \\(f(x)\\) is multiplied by a scalar \\(a\\), then \\(z(w)\\) is also scaled by \\(a\\).\n   - Similarly, if \\(f(x)\\) is multiplied by a scalar \\(b\\), then \\(z(w)\\) is scaled by \\(b\\).\n   - However, knowing only \\(z(w)\\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine whether \\(f(x)\\) was multiplied by \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), because both modifications result in the same form of scaling.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given only the value of \\(z(w)\\), we cannot distinguish between the exact sequence or nature of scalar modifications applied to \\(f(x)\\) unless additional information about the original function \\(f(x)\\) or the specific values of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
