Applying this transformation to \\(z(t)\\) gives us a new function \\(z'(t) = e^{Mt}z(t)\\).\n\n3. **Effect of Transformation on the Differential Equation:**\n   To understand how the transformation affects the original differential equation, we need to derive the differential equation for \\(z'(t)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz'}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{Mt}z(t)) = e^{Mt}\\frac{dz}{dt} + Me^{Mt}z(t)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q\\) into the above expression:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz'}{dt} = e^{Mt}(Pz + Q) + Me^{Mt}z(t) = (Pe^{Mt} + Me^{Mt})z(t) + e^{Mt}Q\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz'}{dt} = (P + M)e^{Mt}z(t) + e^{Mt}Q\n   \\]\n\n4. **Observation of \\(z(t)\\):**\n   If we observe \\(z(t)\\) at time \\(T\\), we have \\(z(T)\\).

This means that instead of solving for \\(z(t)\\), we are solving for \\(w(t) = e^{Mt}z(t)\\).\n\n3. **Transformed Equation**: To understand how the transformation affects the solution, we need to express \\(\\frac{dw}{dt}\\):\n   \\[\n   w(t) = e^{Mt}z(t)\n   \\]\n   Taking the derivative with respect to \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{Mt}z(t)) = Me^{Mt}z(t) + e^{Mt}\\frac{dz}{dt}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q\\) into the above equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = Me^{Mt}z(t) + e^{Mt}(Pz(t) + Q)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = (M + P)e^{Mt}z(t) + e^{Mt}Q\n   \\]\n   Since \\(w(t) = e^{Mt}z(t)\\), we can rewrite the above as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dw}{dt} = (M + P)w(t) + e^{Mt}Q\n   \\]\n\n4. **Observing \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\)**: If we observe \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\), we know \\(z(T)\\).
