This is a well-known property of the Fourier transform known as the frequency shift theorem.\n\n2. **Frequency Shift Theorem**: According to the frequency shift theorem, if \\(x(t) \\leftrightarrow X(f)\\) in the Fourier transform pair, then \\(x(t)e^{2\\pi i f_0 t} \\leftrightarrow X(f - f_0)\\).

This is because multiple signals can have the same shifted spectrum. For example, if \\(X(f)\\) corresponds to one signal, then \\(X(f - f_0)\\) could also correspond to another signal that has been shifted back by \\(f_0\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: While the shifted spectrum \\(X(f - f_0)\\) indicates that the original signal was multiplied by \\(e^{2\\pi i f_0 t}\\) up to a possible additional phase shift or other transformations, we cannot unequivocally determine the exact original signal \\(x(t)\\) from just the shifted spectrum \\(X(f - f_0)\\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
