    "To determine if the original function \\( x(t) \\) and the modifying function \\( h(t) \\) can be uniquely determined from the modified Laplace transform \\( u_y(z) \\), we need to analyze the effects of the modifications on the Laplace transform.\n\n1. **Multiplication by a Scalar Function \\( h(t) \\)**:\n   - The Laplace transform of the modified function \\( y(t) = h(t)x(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     u_y(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} h(t)x(t) dt\n     \\]\n   - This can be rewritten as:\n     \\[\n     u_y(z) = \\left( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} h(t) dt \\right) \\left( \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} x(t) dt \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Let \\( H(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} h(t) dt \\). Then:\n     \\[\n     u_y(z) = H(z) U(z)\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( U(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} x(t) dt \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\).\n\n2. **Uniqueness Analysis**:\n   - From the equation \\( u_y(z) = H(z) U(z) \\), it is clear that knowing \\( u_y(z) \\) alone does not provide enough information to uniquely determine both \\( U(z) \\) (which corresponds to \\( x(t) \\)) and \\( H(z) \\).\n   - If \\( H(z) \\) is known or can be determined, then \\( U(z) \\) can be found by dividing \\( u_y(z) \\) by \\( H(z) \\). However, without additional information about \\( H(z) \\), there can be many possible functions \\( h(t) \\) that could produce the same \\( H(z) \\).\n\n3. **Addition of Another Function \\( w(t) \\)**:\n   - Consider the modified function \\( y(t) = x(t) + w(t) \\). The Laplace transform of \\( y(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     u_y(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} (x(t) + w(t)) dt = U(z) + W(z)\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\( W(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-zt} w(t) dt \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( w(t) \\).\n   - Knowing \\( u_y(z) \\) and \\( W(z) \\) allows us to find \\( U(z) \\) by subtracting \\( W(z) \\) from \\( u_y(z) \\):\n     \\[\n     U(z) = u_y(z) - W(z)\n     \\]\n   - However, without knowledge of \\( W(z) \\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\( U(z) \\) and thus \\( x(t) \\).\n\nBased on the above analysis, it is clear that neither modification (multiplication by \\( h(t) \\) nor addition of \\( w(t) \\)) provides sufficient information to uniquely determine both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( h(t) \\) from the modified Laplace transform \\( u_y(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
