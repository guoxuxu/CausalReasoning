    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The PDE \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\) describes heat conduction in a rod. This is the heat equation.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform at \\(t=0\\)**: Applying the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(u(x, t))\\) at \\(t=0\\) transforms the initial condition from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. This doesn't change the underlying physical process but provides a different perspective on the solution.\n\n3. **Intervention at \\(t=t_1\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), the intervention \\(g(u) = u + c\\) is applied. This means that the temperature at every point \\(x\\) is increased by a constant \\(c\\). Mathematically, if \\(u(x, t)\\) is the temperature at time \\(t\\), then after the intervention at \\(t=t_1\\), the new temperature becomes \\(u(x, t) + c\\) for \\(t \\geq t_1\\).\n\n4. **Effect on Solution**: The heat equation is linear, so the solution can be written as the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous solution satisfies the PDE without any external forcing, while the particular solution accounts for the initial conditions and interventions.\n\n5. **Independence from Initial Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform applied at \\(t=0\\) does not affect the subsequent evolution of the system governed by the heat equation. It only changes the representation of the initial condition. The intervention \\(g(u) = u + c\\) at \\(t=t_1\\) adds a constant to the temperature at all points, which is a simple shift and does not depend on the Fourier transform applied at \\(t=0\\).\n\n6. **Endpoint Analysis**: For \\(T > t_1\\), the endpoint temperature \\(u(x, T)\\) will include the effect of the intervention \\(+c\\). Since the intervention is a constant shift, it will be present in the temperature distribution at any later time, including \\(T > t_1\\).
