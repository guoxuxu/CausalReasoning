This could mean changing boundary conditions, adding heat sources/sinks, etc.\n\n3. **Effect of Intervention**: When the intervention occurs, the nature of the PDE changes. The heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\) no longer fully describes the system because additional terms or different boundary conditions may now be required to accurately model the new situation.\n\n4. **Dependence on Initial Function**: The question asks whether the temperature at any later time \\( T \\) still only depends on the initial function \\( h(x) \\).
