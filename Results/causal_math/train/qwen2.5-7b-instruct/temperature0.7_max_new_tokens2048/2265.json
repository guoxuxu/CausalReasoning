  "Explanation": "The transformation \\\\( z^k \\\\) raises the function to the power k, which alters its phase by k times the original. Although the phase multiplied by k reduces back to its original value at T = k*pi/A, the transformation can involve a multivalued function (depending on k), causing the resultant function to potentially differ.",
