The evolution of \\( \\mathcal{F}(u)(\\xi) \\) over time is given by \\( \\mathcal{F}(u)(\\xi, t) = e^{-4 \\pi^2 \\kappa \\xi^2 t} \\mathcal{F}(u)(\\xi) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:\n   - To get back to the spatial domain, apply the inverse Fourier transform to \\( \\mathcal{F}(u)(\\xi, t) \\) to obtain \\( u(x, t) \\).\n\n4. **Direct Evolution Under Heat Equation**:\n   - Evolve \\( u(x, 0) \\) directly under the heat equation \\( u_t = \\kappa \\nabla^2 u \\) to get \\( u(x, t) \\).\n\nThe key point here is that the Fourier transform method effectively diagonalizes the heat operator in the spatial domain, simplifying the evolution process. When you apply the Fourier transform to the initial condition and then evolve it, and finally take the inverse Fourier transform, you are essentially solving the heat equation in the frequency domain and transforming back to the spatial domain. This process is mathematically equivalent to directly evolving the initial condition under the heat equation in the spatial domain.\n\nTherefore, the temperature distribution \\( u(x, t) \\) at a later time \\( t = T \\) will indeed be the same whether you apply the Fourier transform initially and then evolve or directly evolve the initial condition under the heat equation.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\) and then evolving it according to the heat equation results in the same temperature distribution as evolving \\( u(x, 0) \\) directly, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: We start with the initial temperature distribution \\( u(x, 0) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\( u(x, 0) \\) gives us \\( \\mathcal{F}(u)(\\xi) \\). This transforms the spatial domain into the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Heat Equation in Frequency Domain**: The heat equation in the frequency domain can be derived from the original heat equation. For the Fourier transform of the heat equation, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\mathcal{F}(u)(\\xi, t) = -4 \\pi^2 \\kappa \\|\\xi\\|^2 \\mathcal{F}(u)(\\xi, t)\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Fourier transform of the solution evolves exponentially in time, which simplifies the problem significantly.\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To get back to the spatial domain, we apply the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   u(x, t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathcal{F}(u)(\\xi, t))\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**: The key point is whether the process of transforming to the frequency domain, evolving there, and then transforming back to the spatial domain is equivalent to simply evolving the initial condition in the spatial domain directly.\n\nGiven the linearity and properties of the Fourier transform and the heat equation, it can be shown (through detailed mathematical derivation involving convolution and Fourier series) that these two processes are indeed equivalent. This equivalence is a fundamental result in the theory of partial differential equations and Fourier analysis.\n\nTherefore, the temperature distribution \\( u(x, t) \\) obtained by first applying the Fourier transform to the initial condition and then evolving it according to the heat equation is the same as evolving the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\) directly under the heat equation.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
