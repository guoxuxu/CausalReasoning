The system evolves according to the equation \\( z(t) = Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( h(z) \\)**: At some time \\( t \\), the state \\( z(t) \\) undergoes a transformation given by \\( h(z) = Pe^{Qt}z \\). This means that the state at time \\( t \\) after applying \\( h(z) \\) becomes \\( z'(t) = Pe^{Qt}z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention by \\( i(z) \\)**: An additional intervention occurs at time \\( t_1 \\), where the state is transformed by \\( i(z) = Me^{Nt}z \\). This means that the state at time \\( t_1 \\) after applying \\( i(z) \\) becomes \\( z''(t_1) = Me^{Nt_1}z'(t_1) \\).\n\n4. **Final State at Time \\( T \\)**: We need to determine if the state \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) depends solely on \\( D \\) and not on \\( Q \\) or \\( N \\).\n\nLet's express the state at each stage:\n- Initial state: \\( z(0) = z_0 \\)\n- After transformation \\( h(z) \\): \\( z'(t) = Pe^{Qt}Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\)\n- After intervention \\( i(z) \\): \\( z''(t_1) = Me^{Nt_1}Pe^{Qt}Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\)\n\nNow, we need to find \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\):\n\\[ z(T) = Ce^{DT}z''(t_1) = Ce^{DT}Me^{Nt_1}Pe^{Qt}Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\]\n\nGiven \\( T > t_1 \\), we can simplify the expression as follows:\n\\[ z(T) = Ce^{DT}Me^{Nt_1}Pe^{Qt}Ce^{Dt}z_0 \\]\n\nSince \\( T > t_1 \\), the term \\( e^{DT} \\) will dominate the expression, and the terms involving \\( Q \\) and \\( N \\) will be part of the intermediate transformations but will not affect the final state \\( z(T) \\) if we only consider the exponential growth factor \\( e^{DT} \\) at the end.\n\nTherefore, the state \\( z(T) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend solely on \\( D \\) and not on \\( Q \\) or \\( N \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
