For a series RLC circuit (which simplifies to RL for this case since there's no capacitor mentioned), the impedance \\(Z\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z = R + j\\omega L\n   \\]\n   where \\(j\\) is the imaginary unit.\n\n3. **Current Phasor**: The current \\(I(t)\\) in the circuit can be found from the voltage \\(V(t)\\) using Ohm's law in the phasor domain:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{Z} = \\frac{V_0 e^{i\\omega t}}{R + j\\omega L}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Amplitude of Current**: The amplitude of the current \\(|I(t)|\\) depends on the magnitude of the impedance \\(Z\\):\n   \\[\n   |I(t)| = \\left|\\frac{V_0}{R + j\\omega L}\\right| = \\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L)^2}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Effect of Frequency**: From the above expression, it is clear that as the frequency \\(\\omega\\) increases, the term \\((\\omega L)^2\\) increases, which decreases the denominator \\(\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L)^2}\\). Consequently, the amplitude of the current \\(|I(t)|\\) decreases.\n\n6. **Observation**: If we observe a decrease in the current amplitude \\(|I(t)|\\), it directly indicates that the frequency \\(\\omega\\) has increased.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that a decrease in the current amplitude \\(|I(t)|\\) does indeed definitively infer an increase in the frequency \\(\\omega\\) of the voltage source.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if a decrease in the current amplitude \\(I(t)\\) can definitively be inferred as an increase in the frequency \\(\\omega\\) of the voltage source, let's analyze the system step by step.\n\n1. **Circuit Analysis**: The circuit consists of an inductor \\(L\\) and a resistor \\(R\\) in series, driven by an alternating voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\).\n\n2. **Impedance Calculation**: The impedance \\(Z\\) of the series circuit is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z = R + i\\omega L\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency of the source.\n\n3. **Current Expression**: The current \\(I(t)\\) in the circuit can be found using Ohm's law for AC circuits:\n   \\[\n   I(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{Z} = \\frac{V_0 e^{i\\omega t}}{R + i\\omega L}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Current Amplitude**: The amplitude of the current \\(|I(t)|\\) is:\n   \\[\n   |I(t)| = \\left|\\frac{V_0 e^{i\\omega t}}{R + i\\omega L}\\right| = \\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L)^2}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Effect of Frequency \\(\\omega\\)**: As \\(\\omega\\) increases, the term \\((\\omega L)^2\\) in the denominator increases, which decreases the overall magnitude of the denominator. Consequently, the amplitude of the current \\(|I(t)|\\) decreases because the fraction \\(\\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{R^2 + (\\omega L)^2}}\\) becomes smaller.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: A decrease in the current amplitude \\(|I(t)|\\) directly implies that the denominator of the expression for \\(|I(t)|\\) has increased, which means \\((\\omega L)^2\\) has increased. Therefore, \\(\\omega\\) must have increased.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can definitively infer that an increase in the frequency \\(\\omega\\) of the voltage source caused the decrease in the current amplitude \\(|I(t)|\\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
