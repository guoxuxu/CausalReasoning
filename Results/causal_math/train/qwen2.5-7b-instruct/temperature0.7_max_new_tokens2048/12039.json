The inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s-c} \\) is \\( e^{ct} \\) for \\( c \\) being a constant. Therefore, the inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{(a+b)t}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Analysis of Causal Influences**:\n   - If \\( z(t) \\) were originally \\( e^{at} \\), then the Laplace transform would be \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\), which does not match the given \\( f(z) \\).\n   - If \\( z(t) \\) immediately started as \\( e^{(a+b)t} \\) from \\( t = 0 \\), the Laplace transform would be \\( \\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\), which matches the given \\( f(z) \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the Laplace transform and its inverse, the only function that satisfies the given condition \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s-(a+b)} \\) is \\( z(t) = e^{(a+b)t} \\).\n\nTherefore, we can conclusively determine that \\( z(t) \\) was originally \\( e^{(a+b)t} \\) from \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To determine whether \\( z(t) \\) was originally \\( e^{at} \\) or immediately started as \\( e^{(a+b)t} \\) from \\( t = 0 \\), let's analyze the given information step-by-step.\n\n1. **Given Information**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( f(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt \\).\n   - The transformed function is \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s - (a + b)} \\).\n\n2. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - To find \\( z(t) \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( f(z) \\).\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s - c} \\) is \\( e^{ct} \\) for any constant \\( c \\).\n\n3. **Applying Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - For \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{s - (a + b)} \\), the inverse Laplace transform is \\( z(t) = e^{(a+b)t} \\).\n\n4. **Causal Reasoning**:\n   - The Laplace transform assumes that the function \\( z(t) \\) is causal, meaning it is zero for \\( t < 0 \\).\n   - The form \\( e^{(a+b)t} \\) suggests that \\( z(t) \\) starts growing exponentially with a rate of \\( a + b \\) from \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Original Form of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - If \\( z(t) \\) was originally \\( e^{at} \\) and then immediately switched to \\( e^{(a+b)t} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), the resulting function would not be simply \\( e^{(a+b)t} \\).\n   - Instead, it would involve a more complex piecewise function or a convolution that does not simplify to \\( e^{(a+b)t} \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the inverse Laplace transform directly gives us \\( z(t) = e^{(a+b)t} \\), and there is no indication of a change in the form of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), we can conclude that \\( z(t) \\) was originally \\( e^{(a+b)t} \\) starting from \\( t = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThis indicates that \\( z(t) \\) cannot be conclusively determined to be originally \\( e^{at} \\) if the Laplace transform is \\( \\frac{1}{s - (a + b)} \\). It must have been \\( e^{(a+b)t} \\) from \\( t = 0 \\)."
