    "To determine if the final temperature distribution at time \\( T > t_1 \\) will still be affected by the initial diffusivity \\( k \\), let's reason through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial State**: Before the intervention at time \\( t_1 \\), the system is governed by the heat equation with diffusivity \\( k \\). The solution to this equation depends on the initial conditions and the boundary conditions, but crucially, it also depends on \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Intervention**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the diffusivity is changed to \\( k' \\). This changes the governing equation to include \\( k' \\) instead of \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Post-Intervention Dynamics**: After \\( t_1 \\), the system evolves according to the new diffusivity \\( k' \\). The temperature distribution \\( u(x,t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) will be influenced by the new diffusivity \\( k' \\) rather than the initial \\( k \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions (temperature distribution at \\( t_1^- \\)) set up the state of the system immediately before the change in diffusivity. These initial conditions are determined by the evolution of the system under the original diffusivity \\( k \\) until \\( t_1 \\).\n\n5. **Final State**: The final temperature distribution at time \\( T > t_1 \\) will depend on how the system evolves from the state at \\( t_1 \\) onwards, which is governed by \\( k' \\). However, the initial state at \\( t_1 \\) was influenced by \\( k \\), so there is an indirect effect of \\( k \\) on the final state.\n\nGiven that the temperature distribution at any time after \\( t_1 \\) is influenced by the initial conditions at \\( t_1 \\), and these initial conditions were set by the system evolving under \\( k \\), we can conclude that the final temperature distribution at \\( T > t_1 \\) is indeed affected by the initial diffusivity \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
