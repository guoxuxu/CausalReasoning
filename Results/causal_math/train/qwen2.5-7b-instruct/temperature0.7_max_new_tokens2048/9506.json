The PDE can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = -i\\omega z\n   \\]\n   This is a separable ODE. Integrating both sides with respect to \\(t\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0) e^{-i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(z(0)\\) is the initial condition at \\(t=0\\).\n\n3. **Integral Transformation**: The transformation \\(T[f](z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(z(t)) dt\\) is applied to \\(z(t)\\). Substituting \\(z(t) = z(0) e^{-i\\omega t}\\) into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   T[f](z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(0) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = z(0) \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s + i\\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Evaluating the Integral**: The integral \\(\\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s + i\\omega)t} dt\\) converges if the real part of \\(s + i\\omega\\) is positive (i.e., \\(\\Re(s) > -\\omega\\)). Assuming this condition is met, the integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s + i\\omega)t} dt = \\frac{1}{s + i\\omega}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   T[f](z) = z(0) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s + i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determining \\(z(0)\\)**: Given \\(T[f](z)\\) at time \\(T\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   T[f](z) = \\frac{z(0)}{s + i\\omega}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\(z(0)\\):\n   \\[\n   z(0) = (s + i\\omega) T[f](z)\n   \\]\n   This expression directly provides \\(z(0)\\) once \\(T[f](z)\\) is known.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can indeed determine \\(z(0)\\) from \\(T[f](z)\\) without needing any additional information.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
