    "Let's break down this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Hamiltonian**: The Hamiltonian \\(H = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + v(x)\\) describes a simple harmonic oscillator with a potential energy term \\(v(x)\\).

The Fourier Transform decomposes the signal into its constituent frequencies.\n\n3. **Information Retention**: The Fourier Transform does not retain all the information about the time-domain signal. It only provides the amplitude and phase of each frequency component present in the signal. This means that information about the exact waveform at any specific time (like \\(t=0\\)) is lost when we only have the frequency domain representation.\n\n4. **Initial Condition Determination**: To determine the initial condition \\(x(0)\\), we would need the full time-domain information of \\(x(t)\\) up to and including \\(t=0\\). Since the Fourier Transform only provides frequency components and does not directly give time-domain information, we cannot uniquely determine \\(x(0)\\) solely from \\(X(\\omega, T)\\).\n\n5. **Assumption of No Intermediate States**: Even if we assume no knowledge of intermediate states, having only the frequency domain representation at \\(t=T\\) is insufficient to backtrack to the initial condition without additional information.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to whether the original waveform \\(x(0)\\) at time \\(t=0\\) can be exactly determined from the Fourier Transform \\(X(\\omega, T)\\) observed at time \\(t=T\\) is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

However, for classical systems described here, we can use Hamilton's equations to understand how the system evolves over time.\n\n4. **Initial Condition and Time Dependence**: The initial condition \\(x(0)\\) is the starting point of our analysis. To determine \\(x(0)\\) from \\(X(\\omega, T)\\), we would need to reverse the time evolution process.\n\n5. **Reversibility of Fourier Transform**: The Fourier Transform is reversible, meaning that \\(x(t)\\) can be obtained from \\(X(\\omega, T)\\) using the inverse Fourier Transform.
