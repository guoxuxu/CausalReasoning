Specifically, we need the value of \\( I(t) \\) at some initial time, typically \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform**: Applying the Laplace transform to the differential equation converts it into an algebraic equation. However, the Laplace transform still requires initial conditions to be applied correctly.\n\n4. **Inverting the Laplace Transform**: To find \\( V(t) \\) from \\( I(t) \\), we would typically use the inverse Laplace transform. But for this to work, we need the Laplace transform of \\( V(t) \\), which depends on the initial conditions of \\( I(t) \\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Solution**: The solution to the differential equation (and thus the voltage \\( V(t) \\)) is unique given specific initial conditions. Without these initial conditions, multiple solutions are possible.\n\n6. **Observing Current \\( I(t) \\)**: Observing \\( I(t) \\) for all \\( t > 0 \\) alone does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\( V(t) \\). We need either the initial condition of \\( I(t) \\) or another piece of information to solve the differential equation and invert the Laplace transform uniquely.\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, we cannot determine the exact original voltage waveform \\( V(t) \\) by observing the current \\( I(t) \\) at all times \\( t > 0 \\) without knowing the initial conditions of \\( I \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

However, to find the exact voltage waveform \\( V(t) \\), we need to know how the voltage \\( V \\) changes over time.\n\n3. **Role of Initial Conditions:**\n   The solution to the differential equation depends on both the differential term and the initial condition of the current \\( I(0) \\).

Let \\( I(s) \\) and \\( V(s) \\) be the Laplace transforms of \\( I(t) \\) and \\( V(t) \\), respectively. The transformed equation would be:\n   \\[ V(s) - L[sI(s) - I(0)] - RI(s) = 0 \\]\n   where \\( I(0) \\) represents the initial condition of the current at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Solving for V(s)**:\n   Rearrange the equation to solve for \\( V(s) \\):\n   \\[ V(s) = LsI(s) + LI(0) + RI(s) \\]\n   \\[ V(s) = (Ls + R)I(s) + LI(0) \\]\n\n4. **Inverting the Laplace Transform**:\n   To find \\( V(t) \\) from \\( V(s) \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform.
