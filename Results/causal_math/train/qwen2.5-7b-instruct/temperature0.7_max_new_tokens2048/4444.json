    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We have a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\) that undergoes a transformation \\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant.\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: The function \\( z(t) \\) is transformed at time \\( t \\) using the operator \\( f(z) \\). This implies that at any time \\( t \\), the function evolves as \\( z(t) \\rightarrow e^{At}z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Endpoint Observation**: At time \\( T \\), we observe the value of \\( z(T) \\).
