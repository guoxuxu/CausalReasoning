    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: We have the relationship between temperature \\( T \\) and electrical resistance \\( R \\) given by \\( R(T) = R_0 e^{aT} \\).\n\n2. **Function Application**: The function \\( g(T) = T + \\Delta T \\) is applied to the temperature \\( T \\), resulting in a new temperature \\( T + \\Delta T \\).\n\n3. **Effect on Resistance**: We need to find the effect of applying \\( g(T) \\) on the resistance. Using the initial relationship, the new resistance \\( R(g(T)) \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   R(g(T)) = R(T + \\Delta T) = R_0 e^{a(T + \\Delta T)} = R_0 e^{aT} e^{a\\Delta T}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( R(T) = R_0 e^{aT} \\), we can rewrite this as:\n   \\[\n   R(T + \\Delta T) = R(T) e^{a\\Delta T}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Observation and Determination**: To determine if we can conclusively determine \\( \\Delta T \\) from observing \\( R(T + \\Delta T) \\), we need to see if there is enough information in \\( R(T + \\Delta T) \\) to isolate \\( \\Delta T \\). From the equation above, we see that:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{R(T + \\Delta T)}{R(T)} = e^{a\\Delta T}\n   \\]\n   Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\ln\\left(\\frac{R(T + \\Delta T)}{R(T)}\\right) = a\\Delta T\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( \\Delta T \\):\n   \\[\n   \\Delta T = \\frac{1}{a} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R(T + \\Delta T)}{R(T)}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: If we know \\( R(T) \\) and \\( R(T + \\Delta T) \\), we can calculate \\( \\Delta T \\) using the formula derived. Therefore, it is possible to determine \\( \\Delta T \\) based on the observed values of \\( R(T) \\) and \\( R(T + \\Delta T) \\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
