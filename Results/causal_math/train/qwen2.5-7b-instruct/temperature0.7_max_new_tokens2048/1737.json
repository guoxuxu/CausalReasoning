    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We're dealing with the Laplace transform of a modified function \\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\), and we want to determine if it's equivalent to shifting the Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\) by \\(-a\\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Definition**: The Laplace transform of a function \\(h(t)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\} = H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} h(t) dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Applying the Definition to \\(g(t)\\)**: For \\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\), the Laplace transform is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at}f(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{at} f(t) dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the exponent inside the integral:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-a)t} f(t) dt\n   \\]\n\n4. **Recognizing the Shift**: Notice that the integral now has an exponential term \\(e^{-(s-a)t}\\), which is the same form as the Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\) but with the variable \\(s\\) replaced by \\(s-a\\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-a)t} f(t) dt = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s-a)\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Laplace transform of \\(g(t)\\) is indeed the Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\) evaluated at \\(s-a\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}\\) is not simply \"shifted\" by \\(-a\\), but rather it is the Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\) evaluated at \\(s-a\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Laplace Transform Property**:\n   The key property we need here is the time-shift property of the Laplace transform. For a function \\(f(t)\\), the Laplace transform of \\(e^{-at}f(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{-at}f(t)\\} = F(s + a)\n   \\]\n   where \\(F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}\\).\n\n2. **Apply the Given Function**:\n   In our case, we have \\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\). Notice that this is not exactly in the form of the time-shift property. Instead, it's the inverse of what we typically use for the time-shift property.\n\n3. **Inverse Time-Shift**:\n   If we were to apply a time-shift in the Laplace domain (which would correspond to multiplying by an exponential in the time domain), we would get a shift in the frequency domain. However, \\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\) means we're multiplying by an exponential in the time domain, which should result in a shift in the negative direction in the frequency domain.\n\n4. **Calculate the Laplace Transform of \\(g(t)\\)**:\n   Using the definition of the Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at}f(t)\\}\n   \\]\n   By the first shifting theorem (or the property of multiplication by an exponential in the time domain):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{at}f(t)\\} = F(s - a)\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Laplace transform of \\(g(t)\\) is \\(F(s - a)\\), not \\(F(s + a)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   The Laplace transform of \\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\) is actually \\(F(s - a)\\), not \\(F(s + a)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. Recall the definition of the Laplace transform:\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\]\n\n2. Now, consider the modified function \\(g(t) = e^{at}f(t)\\):\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{at} f(t) dt \\]\n\n3. Combine the exponentials inside the integral:\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-a)t} f(t) dt \\]\n\n4. Recognize that this integral is similar to the Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\), but with a shift in the exponent of the exponential function:\n   \\[ \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\sigma t} f(t) dt \\]\n   where \\(\\sigma = s - a\\).\n\n5.
