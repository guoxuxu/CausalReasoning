    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Original System**: The original system is a series RLC circuit with a transfer function \\(H(s)\\). This implies that the system's behavior can be described by a second-order differential equation in the time domain, which translates to a rational polynomial in the Laplace domain.\n\n2. **Complex Impedance Z(s)**: The given complex impedance \\(Z(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1}\\) introduces a modification to the original system.
