    "To determine if the original function \\( f(w) \\) can be uniquely determined by knowing \\( F(z) \\) across domain \\( D \\), let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral Transformation**: The function \\( F(z) \\) is defined as \\( F(z) = \\int_{a}^{z} f(w) dw \\).
