These depend on the values of \\( R \\), \\( L \\), \\( C \\), and \\( \\omega \\).\n\n5. **Effect of Parallel Resistor**: Introducing \\( R_1 \\) in parallel increases the total resistance, which affects the damping of the system. However, the fundamental frequency of the circuit remains unchanged because the inductor and capacitor still resonate at \\( \\omega \\).\n\n6. **Effect of Increased Frequency**: Increasing \\( \\omega \\) changes the resonance frequency of the circuit. If \\( \\omega \\) is significantly higher than the original resonant frequency, the circuit will no longer be in resonance, and the behavior of the circuit will change. The new steady-state current will have a different amplitude and phase compared to the original steady-state current.\n\nGiven these points, the introduction of \\( R_1 \\) and the increase in \\( \\omega \\) will indeed cause the new steady-state solution for the current \\( I(t) \\) to be significantly different from the original steady-state solution.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
