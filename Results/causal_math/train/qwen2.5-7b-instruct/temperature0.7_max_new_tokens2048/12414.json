This transforms into \\(s\\hat{u}(s) - u(0) = L\\hat{u}(s)\\), which simplifies to \\((sI - L)\\hat{u}(s) = u(0)\\).\n\n3. **Introduction of External Force**: At time \\(t = t_1\\), the differential operator changes from \\(L\\) to \\(L'\\). This change affects the evolution of \\(u(t)\\) after \\(t_1\\).\n\n4. **Evolution Post-Change**: For \\(t > t_1\\), the system evolves according to \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = L'u\\).\n\n5. **Applying Laplace Transform Again**: The Laplace transform for \\(t > t_1\\) would now be \\(\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\mathcal{L}(L'u)\\), leading to \\((sI - L')\\hat{u}(s) = u(t_1)\\).\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**: The transformed function \\(\\hat{u}(s)\\) at \\(s = a\\) is influenced by the initial condition at \\(t_1\\) and the properties of \\(L'\\). Since \\(L'\\) is different from \\(L\\) post \\(t_1\\), the solution \\(\\hat{u}(s)\\) will indeed depend on \\(L'\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The transformed function \\(\\hat{u}(s)\\) at \\(s = a\\) cannot be solely dependent on \\(L'\\) because it also depends on the state of the system at the transition point \\(t_1\\), which is influenced by the original operator \\(L\\) up to that point.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "To determine if the transformed function \\(\\hat{u}(s)\\) at \\(s = a\\) is exclusively dependent on the new operator \\(L'\\), let's break down the process step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The system is initially governed by the PDE \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu\\). Applying the Laplace transform yields:\n   \\[\n   s\\hat{u}(s) - u(0) = L\\hat{u}(s)\n   \\]\n   Rearranging gives:\n   \\[\n   (sI - L)\\hat{u}(s) = u(0)\n   \\]\n   Thus,\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(s) = (sI - L)^{-1}u(0)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Introduction of External Force**: At \\(t = t_1\\), the differential operator is modified to \\(L'\\). This changes the governing equation from \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = Lu \\) to \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = L'u \\) for \\(t \\geq t_1\\).\n\n3. **Effect of Time Evolution**: For \\(t \\geq t_1\\), the solution to the modified PDE with the initial condition \\(u(t_1)\\) (which is the state of the system at \\(t_1\\)) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(s) = (sI - L')^{-1}u(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(u(t_1)\\) depends on the history of the system up to \\(t_1\\), which includes the effect of the original operator \\(L\\) and any external forces applied before \\(t_1\\).\n\n4. **Transformed Function at \\(s = a\\)**: The value of \\(\\hat{u}(s)\\) at \\(s = a\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(a) = (aI - L')^{-1}u(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Since \\(u(t_1)\\) itself is influenced by the entire history of the system including the effects of both \\(L\\) and any external forces, \\(\\hat{u}(a)\\) cannot be said to be exclusively dependent on \\(L'\\). It also carries the imprint of the previous operator \\(L\\) and the external forces that led to the state at \\(t_1\\).\n\nTherefore, the transformed function \\(\\hat{u}(s)\\) at \\(s = a\\) is not exclusively dependent on the new operator \\(L'\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
