    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: We start with the equation \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\), where \\( z = x + iy \\).\n\n2. **Transformation T**: The variable \\( z \\) undergoes a transformation \\( T(z) = z^3 \\). Let's denote the result of this transformation as \\( z_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   z_1 = (x + iy)^3\n   \\]\n   Using the binomial expansion for complex numbers:\n   \\[\n   z_1 = (x + iy)^3 = x^3 + 3ix^2y - 3xy^2 - iy^3\n   \\]\n   Separating real and imaginary parts:\n   \\[\n   z_1 = (x^3 - 3xy^2) + i(3x^2y - y^3)\n   \\]\n   So, we can write \\( z_1 = u + iv \\), where:\n   \\[\n   u = x^3 - 3xy^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v = 3x^2y - y^3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transformation S**: An additional transformation \\( S(z_1) = z_1^2 \\) is applied to \\( z_1 \\). Let's denote the result of this transformation as \\( z_1^2 \\):\n   \\[\n   z_1^2 = (u + iv)^2 = u^2 - v^2 + 2iuv\n   \\]\n   So, if we denote \\( z_1^2 = x_{\\text{new}} + iy_{\\text{new}} \\), then:\n   \\[\n   x_{\\text{new}} = u^2 - v^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y_{\\text{new}} = 2uv\n   \\]\n\n4. **Checking the New Condition**: We need to check if \\( z_1^2 \\) still satisfies the original equation \\( ax^2 + by^2 = c \\):\n   \\[\n   a(x_{\\text{new}})^2 + b(y_{\\text{new}})^2 = a(u^2 - v^2)^2 + b(2uv)^2\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   a(x_{\\text{new}})^2 + b(y_{\\text{new}})^2 = a(u^4 - 2u^2v^2 + v^4) + 4b(uv)^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = au^4 - 2au^2v^2 + av^4 + 4bu^2v^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = au^4 + 2au^2v^2 + av^4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = a(u^2 + v^2)^2\n   \\]\n   Since \\( z_1 = u + iv \\), we know that \\( |z_1|^2 = u^2 + v^2 \\).
