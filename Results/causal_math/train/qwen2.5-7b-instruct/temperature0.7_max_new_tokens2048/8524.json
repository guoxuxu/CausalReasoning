    "Let's break down the given equation and analyze it step by step:\n\nGiven:\n\\[ g(w(T)) = e^{\\mu t_1(z^2+cz) + \\lambda(T-t_1)(z^2+cz)} \\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\\[ g(w(T)) = e^{(t_1\\mu + (T-t_1)\\lambda)(z^2+cz)} \\]\n\nThe expression inside the exponent is a linear combination of \\( t_1 \\) and \\( T \\).

This means that the terms involving \\( t_1 \\) and \\( T \\) are not independent.\n\n2. **Uniqueness of Coefficients**: The coefficients of \\( t_1 \\) and \\( T \\) in the expression must uniquely determine \\( \\mu \\) and \\( \\lambda \\).
