    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation**:\n   - The given differential equation is \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).\n   - This is a first-order linear differential equation.\n   - The solution to this differential equation is \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt \\).\n   - Substituting \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\) into the Fourier transform:\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} (A e^{i\\omega t}) dt = A \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt = A \\cdot 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega)\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega) \\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Interpreting the Fourier Transform Result**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) results in a peak at \\( \\omega \\) with amplitude \\( A \\cdot 2\\pi \\).\n   - If there is an intervention that changes the frequency, it would affect the peak location in the Fourier domain.\n\n4. **Effect of Intervention**:\n   - Suppose an intervention changes the frequency from \\( \\omega \\) to \\( \\omega' \\). Then, the new function would be \\( z'(t) = A e^{i\\omega' t} \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z'(t) \\) would then be:\n     \\[\n     F(z') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} (A e^{i\\omega' t}) dt = A \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i(\\omega - \\omega') t} dt = A \\cdot 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\n     \\]\n   - The peak would now be at \\( \\omega' \\).\n\n5. **Determining the Intervention**:\n   - By comparing the peak location in the Fourier transform before and after the intervention, we can determine if the frequency has changed.\n   - If the peak moves from \\( \\omega \\) to \\( \\omega' \\), we know that the frequency has been altered.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can precisely determine if a change in frequency was applied as an intervention by observing the peak location in the Fourier transform.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation Analysis**:\n   - The differential equation governing \\( z(t) \\) is \\( \\dot{z} = i\\omega z \\).\n   - This is a first-order linear differential equation with the general solution \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt \\).\n   - Substituting \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\) into the Fourier transform, we get:\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} (A e^{i\\omega t}) dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A dt.\n     \\]\n   - However, this integral does not converge because it involves integrating a constant over the entire real line. Therefore, we need to consider the context of the Fourier transform more carefully.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Context**:\n   - In practice, the Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) would be considered over a specific interval or with appropriate normalization factors.\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a Dirac delta function: \\( F(z) = 2\\pi A \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\), where \\( \\omega' \\) is the frequency parameter in the Fourier domain.\n\n4. **Intervention Analysis**:\n   - If there is an intervention that changes the frequency from \\( \\omega \\) to \\( \\omega' \\), the new function would be \\( z'(t) = A e^{i\\omega' t} \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( z'(t) \\) would then be \\( F(z') = 2\\pi A \\delta(\\omega' - \\omega) \\).\n\n5. **Determining the Intervention**:\n   - Given the Fourier transform \\( F(z) \\) after an unknown intervention, we can identify the frequency \\( \\omega' \\) from the location of the Dirac delta function.\n   - If the Fourier transform shows a peak at \\( \\omega' \\), we can determine that the frequency was changed to \\( \\omega' \\).\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can indeed determine if a change in frequency was applied as an intervention by analyzing the location of the peak in the Fourier transform.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
