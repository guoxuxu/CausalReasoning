    "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine if the resulting vector is solely dependent on the last transformation \\(N\\) irrespective of the initial application of \\(M\\).\n\n1. **Initial Transformation with \\(M\\)**:\n   - We start with a vector \\(v\\).\n   - The vector \\(v\\) is transformed by the linear transformation represented by matrix \\(M\\). Let the resulting vector be \\(v' = Mv\\).\n\n2. **Application of Complex Function \\(f(z)\\)**:\n   - Next, we apply the complex function \\(f(z) = e^{Az + B}\\) to \\(v'\\). However, it's important to note that typically, the function \\(f(z)\\) would be applied to a scalar or a component of the vector. If we assume that the function is applied to some scalar derived from \\(v'\\), the exact form would depend on how \\(f(z)\\) is defined for vectors.\n\n3. **Transformation with \\(N\\)**:\n   - The vector \\(v'\\) (or a scalar derived from it) is then transformed by another linear transformation represented by matrix \\(N\\). Let the resulting vector after this transformation be \\(w = Nv'\\).\n\n4. **Final Application of \\(f(z)\\)**:\n   - Finally, the complex function \\(f(z) = e^{Az + B}\\) is applied to \\(w\\). This results in a new vector or scalar depending on the definition of \\(f(z)\\).\n\nGiven these steps, let's consider whether the resulting vector is solely dependent on the last transformation \\(N\\):\n\n- The initial transformation by \\(M\\) affects the vector but is not directly involved in the final application of \\(f(z)\\).\n- The function \\(f(z)\\) is applied to a vector or scalar derived from \\(v'\\) (after applying \\(M\\)), not directly to \\(v\\).\n- The transformation by \\(N\\) directly influences the vector just before the final application of \\(f(z)\\).\n\nThus, while the initial transformation by \\(M\\) does affect the vector, the final result after applying \\(f(z)\\) is primarily determined by the transformations \\(N\\) and the function \\(f(z)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine if the resulting vector is solely dependent on the last transformation \\(N\\) irrespective of the initial application of \\(M\\).\n\n1. **Initial Transformation by \\(M\\):**\n   - Let's denote the original vector as \\(v\\).\n   - After applying the linear transformation \\(M\\), the vector becomes \\(Mv\\).\n\n2. **Application of Complex Function \\(f(z)\\):**\n   - The function \\(f(z) = e^{Az + B}\\) is applied to the vector \\(Mv\\). However, note that \\(f(z)\\) is typically a function of a scalar variable, not a vector. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding or simplification needed here. If we assume \\(f\\) is applied component-wise (which is a common approach for vector functions), then \\(f(Mv)\\) would mean applying \\(f\\) to each component of the vector \\(Mv\\).\n\n3. **Additional Transformation by \\(N\\):**\n   - Now, the vector \\(Mv\\) (or \\(f(Mv)\\)) undergoes another linear transformation \\(N\\). This results in the vector \\(N \\cdot Mv\\) (or \\(N \\cdot f(Mv)\\) if \\(f\\) is applied component-wise).\n\n4. **Final Application of \\(f(z)\\):**\n   - Finally, the complex function \\(f(z)\\) is applied again to the result of the transformation \\(N \\cdot Mv\\) (or \\(N \\cdot f(Mv)\\)). This gives us \\(f(N \\cdot Mv)\\) (or \\(f(N \\cdot f(Mv))\\)).\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis:**\n   - The dependency of the final vector on the transformations can be seen as follows:\n     - Initially, \\(Mv\\) is transformed.\n     - Then, \\(N\\) acts on \\(Mv\\), making the final result dependent on both \\(M\\) and \\(N\\).\n     - The function \\(f\\) is applied twice, but its effect depends on the intermediate state after \\(N\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the resulting vector is not solely dependent on the last transformation \\(N\\); it also depends on the initial transformation \\(M\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
