  "Problem": "Consider a system of linear equations modeled as \\\\( Ax = b \\\\), where A is a constant matrix and b is a known vector.

  "Explanation": "The final condition \\\\( Ax = b \\\\) might be satisfied through different pathways (applying \\\\( T \\\\), \\\\( U \\\\), both, or neither).
