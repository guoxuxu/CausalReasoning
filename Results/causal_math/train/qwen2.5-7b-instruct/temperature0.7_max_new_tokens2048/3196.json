The impedance of the resistor \\(Z_R = R\\) and the impedance of the capacitor \\(Z_C = \\frac{1}{i\\omega C}\\). The transfer function from the input voltage to the output voltage across the capacitor can be derived.\n\n5. **Transfer Function**: The transfer function \\(H(s)\\) for the RC circuit in the Laplace domain is:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\frac{V(s)}{U(s)} = \\frac{1/(sC)}{R + 1/(sC)} = \\frac{1}{RCs + 1}\n   \\]\n   where \\(s = i\\omega\\) for our sinusoidal input.\n\n6. **Output Voltage in Frequency Domain**: Substituting \\(s = i\\omega\\) into the transfer function, we get:\n   \\[\n   V(i\\omega) = \\frac{1}{Ri\\omega C + 1} U_0\n   \\]\n\n7. **Amplitude and Phase**: The amplitude and phase of the output voltage \\(v(t)\\) can be determined from the magnitude and phase of the transfer function. Specifically:\n   \\[\n   |V(i\\omega)| = \\left| \\frac{1}{Ri\\omega C + 1} \\right| U_0 = \\frac{U_0}{\\sqrt{(Ri\\omega C)^2 + 1}}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\angle V(i\\omega) = -\\tan^{-1}(Ri\\omega C)\n   \\]\n\n8. **Filter Consideration**: If no additional filter is added, the output voltage will follow the behavior described by the RC circuit. Any deviation from this behavior could indicate the presence of an additional filter.\n\n9. **Determining Filter Presence**: Given that all frequencies are possible, the output voltage properties (amplitude and phase) should theoretically match the expected behavior of an RC circuit. However, if there are deviations, it suggests the presence of an additional filter.\n\nSince the problem states that we have properties of the output voltage at time \\(T\\), and these properties are expected to be consistent with the RC circuit without any filters, any observed deviation would indicate the presence of an additional filter.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the analysis, we can conclude that we can unambiguously determine whether a filter was added during the experiment.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
