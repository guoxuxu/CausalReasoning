    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: At \\( t = 0 \\), the complex function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) represents a point on the unit circle in the complex plane.

This is because the magnitude of \\( e^{int} \\) is always 1.\n   - However, the angle (or argument) of the complex number changes from \\( t \\) to \\( nt \\). This means that the angular velocity (rate of change of the angle with respect to time) is now \\( n \\) times faster than it was originally.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Despite the increased angular velocity, the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) after applying the transformation \\( f(z) = z^n \\) still traces out a unit circle in the complex plane. The only difference is that the circle is traversed \\( n \\) times as fast as before.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
