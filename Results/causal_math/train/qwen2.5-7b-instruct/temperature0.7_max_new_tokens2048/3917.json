This theorem holds regardless of the shape or deformation of the contour, as long as the contour remains within the domain where \\( f(z) \\) is holomorphic.\n\n3. **Deformation of Contour**: According to the homotopy version of Cauchy's Integral Theorem, if two contours are continuously deformable into each other within a simply connected domain, then the integrals of \\( f(z) \\) over these contours are equal.
