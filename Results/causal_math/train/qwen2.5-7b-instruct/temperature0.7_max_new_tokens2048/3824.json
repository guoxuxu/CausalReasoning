    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **System Dynamics**: The system is described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{X} = MX + K\\).

Without knowledge of the initial state \\(X(0)\\) or the exact sequence and timing of the transformations, it is impossible to uniquely determine the transformations applied.\n- **Non-uniqueness of Transformations**: Even if we know \\(X(T)\\), there could be multiple sequences of transformations (both \\(h(X)\\) and \\(l(X)\\)) that lead to the same state \\(X(T)\\) due to the non-linearity and potential superposition of transformations.\n- **Lack of Information on \\(K\\)**: The constant vector \\(K\\) in the differential equation introduces an additional layer of complexity. Without knowing \\(K\\), it is impossible to disambiguate the effects of the transformations from the effects of \\(K\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the above points, we cannot definitively state which transformations were applied and at what times simply by knowing \\(X(T)\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
