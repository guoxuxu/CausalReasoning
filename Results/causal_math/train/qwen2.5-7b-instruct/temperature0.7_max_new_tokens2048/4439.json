The inverse Laplace transform of this product gives the current \\( I(t) \\) due to the original filter \\( F(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   I(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s) \\cdot \\tilde{V}(s)\\}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a secondary filter \\( G(s) \\) is applied to the transformed voltage signal. This means that after \\( t_1 \\), the voltage signal becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\tilde{V}_{\\text{int}}(s) = G(s) \\cdot \\tilde{V}(s)\n   \\]\n   However, since \\( G(s) \\) is applied only after \\( t_1 \\), it does not affect the part of \\( I(t) \\) that occurred before \\( t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Response Due to Secondary Filter \\( G(s) \\)**: For \\( t > t_1 \\), the new voltage signal in the Laplace domain is \\( G(s) \\cdot \\tilde{V}(s) \\). Applying the filter \\( F(s) \\) to this new signal gives:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{I_{\\text{new}}(t)\\} = F(s) \\cdot G(s) \\cdot \\tilde{V}(s)\n   \\]\n   Taking the inverse Laplace transform, we get:\n   \\[\n   I_{\\text{new}}(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s) \\cdot G(s) \\cdot \\tilde{V}(s)\\}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison of Currents**:\n   - Before \\( t_1 \\), the current is determined solely by \\( F(s) \\).\n   - After \\( t_1 \\), the current is determined by both \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the current \\( I(T) \\) at any time \\( T > t_1 \\) is indeed affected by both \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\), not just by \\( G(s) \\) alone.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
