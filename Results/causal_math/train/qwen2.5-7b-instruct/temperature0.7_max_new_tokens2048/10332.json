    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation \\(u_t = k u_{xx}\\) describes how the temperature \\(u\\) changes over time due to thermal diffusion.

The solution at any time \\(T\\) only depends on the initial condition and the diffusion process.
