    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Complex Potential Function**:\n   - The original complex potential function \\( w(z) = Uz + \\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi i} \\ln(z) \\) describes a uniform flow (with velocity \\( U \\)) combined with a source at the origin (strength \\( \\kappa \\)).\n   \n2. **Introducing a Sink**:\n   - An additional term representing a sink at a point \\( a \\) is added: \\( -\\frac{\\kappa'}{2\\pi i} \\ln(z - a) \\).\n   - This term describes a sink (negative strength \\( -\\kappa' \\)) located at \\( z = a \\).\n\n3. **Flow Structure at Large Distances**:\n   - At large distances from the origin, the logarithmic terms \\( \\ln(z) \\) and \\( \\ln(z - a) \\) become significant.\n   - For large \\( |z| \\), the dominant behavior of the logarithmic terms can be approximated using the properties of logarithms:\n     \\[\n     \\ln(z) \\approx \\ln(|z|) + i \\arg(z)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\ln(z - a) \\approx \\ln(|z| - |a|) + i \\arg(z - a)\n     \\]\n   - At very large distances, the argument terms (\\( \\arg(z) \\) and \\( \\arg(z - a) \\)) become negligible compared to the real part, so we focus on the real parts:\n     \\[\n     \\ln(z) \\approx \\ln(|z|)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\ln(z - a) \\approx \\ln(|z| - |a|)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplifying the Complex Potential at Large Distances**:\n   - For large \\( |z| \\), the complex potential function becomes:\n     \\[\n     w(z) \\approx Uz + \\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi i} \\ln(|z|) - \\frac{\\kappa'}{2\\pi i} \\ln(|z| - |a|)\n     \\]\n   - At very large distances, the term \\( \\ln(|z| - |a|) \\) is approximately \\( \\ln(|z|) - \\ln(1 - \\frac{|a|}{|z|}) \\). For large \\( |z| \\), \\( \\ln(1 - \\frac{|a|}{|z|}) \\approx -\\frac{|a|}{|z|} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\ln(|z| - |a|) \\approx \\ln(|z|) - \\frac{|a|}{|z|}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting this back into the potential function:\n     \\[\n     w(z) \\approx Uz + \\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi i} \\left( \\ln(|z|) - \\frac{|a|}{|z|} \\right) - \\frac{\\kappa'}{2\\pi i} \\left( \\ln(|z|) - \\frac{|a|}{|z|} \\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     w(z) \\approx Uz + \\left( \\frac{\\kappa - \\kappa'}{2\\pi i} \\right) \\ln(|z|) - \\left( \\frac{\\kappa + \\kappa'}{2\\pi i} \\right) \\frac{|a|}{|z|}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - At large distances, the influence of the sink is present but becomes a correction term to the original flow structure, which is dominated by the uniform flow and the source term.\n   - The overall flow structure, including the velocity field, will still be primarily determined by the uniform flow and the source, with small corrections due to the sink.\n\nTherefore, the overall flow structure at a large distance from the origin will be largely independent of the sink's influence.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the overall flow structure at a large distance from the origin will be independent of the sink's influence, let's analyze the given complex potential functions step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Complex Potential Function:**\n   \\[\n   w(z) = Uz + \\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi i} \\ln(z)\n   \\]\n   This represents a uniform flow with velocity \\( U \\) combined with a source of strength \\( \\kappa \\) located at the origin.\n\n2. **Additional Sink Function:**\n   \\[\n   w_{\\text{sink}}(z) = -\\frac{\\kappa'}{2\\pi i} \\ln(z - a)\n   \\]\n   This represents a sink of strength \\( -\\kappa' \\) located at \\( z = a \\).\n\n3. **Total Complex Potential Function:**\n   The total complex potential function combining both the initial flow and the sink is:\n   \\[\n   w_{\\text{total}}(z) = Uz + \\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi i} \\ln(z) - \\frac{\\kappa'}{2\\pi i} \\ln(z - a)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Behavior at Large Distance:**\n   To understand the behavior at large distances from the origin (i.e., as \\( |z| \\to \\infty \\)), we can analyze the dominant terms in the expression for \\( w_{\\text{total}}(z) \\).\n\n   - For large \\( |z| \\):\n     \\[\n     \\ln(z) \\approx \\ln(|z|) + i\\theta\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\ln(z - a) \\approx \\ln(|z|) + i(\\theta - \\arg(a))\n     \\]\n     Here, \\( \\theta \\) is the argument of \\( z \\), and \\( \\arg(a) \\) is the argument of \\( a \\).\n\n5. **Simplifying the Logarithmic Terms:**\n   At large \\( |z| \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi i} \\ln(z) \\approx \\frac{\\kappa}{2\\pi i} (\\ln(|z|) + i\\theta) = \\frac{\\kappa \\ln(|z|)}{2\\pi i} - \\frac{\\kappa \\theta}{2\\pi}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{\\kappa'}{2\\pi i} \\ln(z - a) \\approx -\\frac{\\kappa'}{2\\pi i} (\\ln(|z|) + i(\\theta - \\arg(a))) = -\\frac{\\kappa' \\ln(|z|)}{2\\pi i} + \\frac{\\kappa' (\\theta - \\arg(a))}{2\\pi i}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Combining the Terms:**\n   Combining these terms, the dominant term for large \\( |z| \\) is:\n   \\[\n   w_{\\text{total}}(z) \\approx Uz + \\left( \\frac{\\kappa \\ln(|z|)}{2\\pi i} - \\frac{\\kappa' \\ln(|z|)}{2\\pi i} \\right) - \\frac{\\kappa \\theta}{2\\pi} + \\frac{\\kappa' (\\theta - \\arg(a))}{2\\pi i}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   w_{\\text{total}}(z) \\approx Uz + \\frac{(\\kappa - \\kappa') \\ln(|z|)}{2\\pi i} - \\frac{\\kappa \\theta}{2\\pi} + \\frac{\\kappa' (\\theta - \\arg(a))}{2\\pi i}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   As \\( |z| \\to \\infty \\), the term \\( Uz \\) dominates, and the influence of the logarithmic terms becomes negligible compared to the linear term \\( Uz \\). Therefore, the overall flow structure at large distances from the origin is primarily determined by the uniform flow component \\( U \\), and the sink's influence diminishes.\n\nThus, the overall flow structure at a large distance from the origin will indeed be independent of the sink's influence.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
