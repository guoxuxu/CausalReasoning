    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Impedance**: The circuit initially has an impedance function \\(Z_1(s)\\), which describes how it behaves in the Laplace domain.\n\n2. **Operational Intervention**: At a certain point in time, an intervention changes the impedance from \\(Z_1(s)\\) to \\(Z_2(s)\\). This new impedance function is defined as \\(Z_2(s) = Z_1(s) + \\Delta Z(s)\\).\n\n3. **Implication of the Change**: The addition of \\(\\Delta Z(s)\\) means that the circuit now has a different impedance function than it did before the intervention.
