However, the integral over the contour remains unchanged because the transformation \\( j(w) \\) does not alter the nature of the integral but rather the parametrization of the path.\n\n4. **Combining Both Transformations:**\n   If both \\( h(w) \\) and \\( j(w) \\) are applied, then:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{C} \\frac{e^{i\\theta} f(e^{i\\phi} w)}{w - z} dw\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\( g(z) \\) will still be scaled by \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) due to the transformation on \\( f(w) \\), and the integral form remains consistent with the original \\( g(z) \\).\n\nGiven these steps, the outcome of \\( g(z) \\) does indeed depend on the original function \\( f(w) \\) as well as the transformations \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the outcome of \\( g(z) \\) only depends on the original function \\( f(w) \\) and not on the transformations \\( h(w) \\) and \\( j(w) \\), let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding \\( g(z) \\):**\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{C} \\frac{f(w)}{w - z} dw\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( C \\) is a closed contour that encloses \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( h(w) = e^{i\\theta}w \\):**\n   If we apply \\( h(w) \\) to \\( f(w) \\), the new function becomes \\( h(f(w)) \\). However, since \\( g(z) \\) is defined using \\( f(w) \\) directly within the integral, the transformation \\( h(w) \\) does not change the form of \\( g(z) \\) as long as it remains inside the integral.\n\n3. **Transformation \\( j(w) = e^{i\\phi}w \\):**\n   Similarly, if we apply \\( j(w) \\) to the contour \\( C \\), the contour itself is transformed, but the integral form of \\( g(z) \\) still involves \\( f(w) \\) evaluated at points within the transformed contour. The key aspect here is how the contour transformation affects the integral.\n\n4. **Effect of Contour Transformation on \\( g(z) \\):**\n   When the contour is transformed by \\( j(w) \\), the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{j(C)} \\frac{f(j^{-1}(w))}{j^{-1}(w) - z} j'(j^{-1}(w)) dw\n   \\]\n   Since \\( j(w) = e^{i\\phi}w \\), we have \\( j^{-1}(w) = \\frac{w}{e^{i\\phi}} \\) and \\( j'(w) = ie^{i\\phi} \\). Substituting these into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{j(C)} \\frac{f(\\frac{w}{e^{i\\phi}})}{\\frac{w}{e^{i\\phi}} - z} ie^{i\\phi} dw\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the expression inside the integral:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{j(C)} \\frac{ie^{i\\phi} f(\\frac{w}{e^{i\\phi}})}{\\frac{w - ze^{i\\phi}}{e^{i\\phi}}} dw = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{j(C)} \\frac{ie^{i\\phi} f(\\frac{w}{e^{i\\phi}})}{w - ze^{i\\phi}} dw\n   \\]\n   This shows that the integral is effectively over the same function \\( f \\) but with the variable scaled and shifted, which does not fundamentally change the dependency on \\( f(w) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   Both transformations \\( h(w) \\) and \\( j(w) \\) do not change the fundamental dependency of \\( g(z) \\) on \\( f(w) \\). They affect the form of the integral but maintain the dependency on the original function \\( f(w) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
