This means that any subsequent value of \\( z \\) will be shifted by \\( c \\).\n   - If we denote the state of \\( z \\) just before the intervention as \\( z(t_1^-) \\), then after the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the new state becomes \\( z(t_1^+) = z(t_1^-) + c \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 + v \\):**\n   - The transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 + v \\) is applied to the state \\( z \\). However, this transformation does not directly appear in the given problem statement. We need to consider how it might interact with the other transformations.\n\n4. **Influence of \\( v \\) and \\( c \\) on \\( g(z(T)) \\):**\n   - The function \\( g(z) = e^{Az} \\) depends on \\( z \\) through the exponent \\( Az \\).\n   - Since \\( h(z) = z + c \\) shifts \\( z \\) by \\( c \\), the effect of \\( c \\) is to shift the argument of the exponential function.\n   - The term \\( v \\) from the transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 + v \\) does not directly affect \\( g(z) \\) unless it modifies \\( z \\) in some way, which is not explicitly stated in the problem.\n\n5. **Outcome Analysis:**\n   - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the state of \\( z \\) at time \\( T \\) would be influenced by both the exponential growth determined by \\( A \\) and the shift \\( c \\) introduced at \\( t_1 \\).\n   - The term \\( v \\) does not appear in the expression for \\( g(z) \\) directly, so it does not influence \\( g(z(T)) \\) in this context.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The outcome \\( g(z(T)) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on \\( A \\) through the exponential function and on \\( c \\) due to the shift at \\( t_1 \\).
