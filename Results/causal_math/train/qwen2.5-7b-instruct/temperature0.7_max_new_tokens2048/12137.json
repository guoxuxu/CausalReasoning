    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Original Integral**: We start with the integral of \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) over a closed contour \\( C \\).

When this is applied, we get the new integrand \\( e^{iz}z^2 \\).\n\n3. **Analyzing the New Integrand**: The function \\( e^{iz}z^2 \\) is not necessarily analytic everywhere because \\( e^{iz} \\) introduces non-analytic behavior at points where \\( z \\) is real and negative (due to the periodicity and branch cuts of the exponential function).\n\n4. **Impact on Integral**: The presence of the factor \\( e^{iz} \\) means that the original Cauchy's integral theorem does not directly apply. However, the specific form of \\( e^{iz} \\) suggests that the integral might have some non-trivial value depending on the path \\( C \\).\n\n5. **Determining the Transformation**: Given only the result of the integral \\( \\int_C e^{iz} z^2 dz \\), it is impossible to definitively determine whether the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\) was applied.

Thus, the transformed integral also evaluates to zero under similar conditions.\n\n6. **Determining the Transformation**: Given only the outcome of the integral, i.e., knowing that the integral result is zero, we cannot uniquely determine whether the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\) was applied.
