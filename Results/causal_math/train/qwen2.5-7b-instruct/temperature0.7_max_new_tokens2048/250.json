This means the state \\(x(t)\\) after applying \\(L\\) will be different from the original state evolution \\(x(t) = e^{At}x_0\\). Specifically, the application of \\(L\\) will modify the state trajectory in a way that includes the integral term.\n\n4. **Determining Initial State**: To uniquely determine the initial state \\(x_0\\) from \\(x(T)\\), we would ideally need information about the entire history of the system up to time \\(T\\).

Here, \\(B\\) is another constant matrix, and \\(\\phi(x(s))\\) is some function of the state \\(x(s)\\).\n\n3. **Impact of \\(L\\)**: The application of \\(L\\) introduces a non-trivial integral term into the dynamics, which effectively modifies how the state evolves over time.
