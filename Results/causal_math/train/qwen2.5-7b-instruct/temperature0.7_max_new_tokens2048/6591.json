    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: We start with \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\).

This means that at any time \\( t \\), the state of the system becomes \\( z(t) = e^{At}e^{Bt}z_0 = e^{(A+B)t}z_0 \\).\n\n3. **Intervention at \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention via \\( g(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) is applied. This means that at \\( t = t_1 \\), the state of the system is multiplied by \\( e^{Ct_1} \\). So, the new state immediately after the intervention is \\( z(t_1^+) = e^{Ct_1}z(t_1) \\).\n\n4. **Continued Evolution**: After the intervention, the system continues to evolve according to the original dynamics.
