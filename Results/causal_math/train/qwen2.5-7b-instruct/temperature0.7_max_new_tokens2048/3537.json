    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original PDE**: The given PDE is \\(\\nabla^2 u(x, y) = -\\lambda u(x, y)\\), where \\(\\nabla^2\\) is the Laplacian operator.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) converts a function from its spatial domain to its frequency domain. For a 2D function \\(u(x, y)\\), the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(u)(k_x, k_y)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(u)(k_x, k_y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x, y) e^{-i(k_x x + k_y y)} dx dy\n   \\]\n\n3. **Applying Fourier Transform to PDE**: Applying the Fourier transform to both sides of the PDE, we use the property that the Fourier transform of the Laplacian \\(\\nabla^2 u(x, y)\\) is \\(- (k_x^2 + k_y^2) \\mathcal{F}(u)(k_x, k_y)\\).

Specifically, for each pair \\((k_x, k_y)\\) satisfying \\(k_x^2 + k_y^2 = \\lambda\\), the amplitude of the corresponding frequency component \\(\\mathcal{F}(u)(k_x, k_y)\\) is determined by the solution of the original PDE.\n\n6. **Effect of \\(\\lambda\\)**: The value of \\(\\lambda\\) thus directly affects the frequency components of the solution in the Fourier domain. It determines the allowed values of \\((k_x, k_y)\\) and hence the form of the solution in the frequency domain.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of the solution \\(u(x, y)\\) is indeed affected by the presence of \\(\\lambda\\) in the original PDE.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
