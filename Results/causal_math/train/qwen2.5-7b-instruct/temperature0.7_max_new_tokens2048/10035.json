To solve it, we can use an integrating factor. The integrating factor is \\( e^{-i\\omega t} \\).

However, this transformation does not change the underlying dynamics described by the differential equation. It only scales the state vector \\( z \\) by \\( e^{At} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Consider the New Transformation \\( j(z) = e^{Bt}z \\) Applied at Time \\( t_1 \\)\nApplying \\( j(z) = e^{Bt}z \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) further scales the state vector by \\( e^{B(t-t_1)} \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\). This transformation affects the state but does not alter the fundamental dynamics of the differential equation.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Final State \\( z(T) \\)\nFor \\( T > t_1 \\), the state \\( z(T) \\) after applying the transformations is:\n\\[ z(T) = e^{B(T-t_1)} \\left( -\\frac{k}{i\\omega} + \\left(z_0 + \\frac{k}{i\\omega}\\right)e^{i\\omega t_1} \\right) \\]\n\nThis expression shows that the final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on the original parameters \\( i\\omega \\) and \\( k \\), the initial condition \\( z_0 \\), and the transformations \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is influenced by both the original differential equation's parameters and the transformations \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).
