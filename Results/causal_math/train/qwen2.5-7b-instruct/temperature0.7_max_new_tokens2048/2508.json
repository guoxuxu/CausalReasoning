The key point here is whether the application of the Fourier transform leaves unique signatures in \\(u(x,T)\\) that distinguish it from other possible transformations or no transformation at all.\n\n6. **Signature of Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of a function \\(u(x,0)\\) will result in a transformed function in the frequency domain.
