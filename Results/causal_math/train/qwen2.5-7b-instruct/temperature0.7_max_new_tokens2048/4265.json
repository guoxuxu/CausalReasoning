    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding Convolution and Impulse Response**:\n   - The output of a system with input \\(x(t)\\) and impulse response \\(h(t)\\) is given by the convolution \\(y(t) = x(t) \\ast h(t)\\).\n   - Given that \\(h_2(t) = t \\ast h_1(t)\\), we need to understand what this means.\n\n2. **Impulse Response Relationship**:\n   - The equation \\(h_2(t) = t \\ast h_1(t)\\) suggests that \\(h_2(t)\\) is the result of convolving \\(t\\) (which is a time-shifted and scaled identity function) with \\(h_1(t)\\).\n\n3. **Applying Input to Systems**:\n   - If \\(x(t)\\) is first passed through a system with impulse response \\(h_1(t)\\), the output is \\(y_1(t) = x(t) \\ast h_1(t)\\).\n   - Then, if \\(y_1(t)\\) is passed through a system with impulse response \\(h_2(t)\\), the final output is \\(z(t) = y_1(t) \\ast h_2(t) = [x(t) \\ast h_1(t)] \\ast (t \\ast h_1(t))\\).\n\n4. **Convolution Property**:\n   - Using the associative property of convolution, we can rewrite the above expression as:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = x(t) \\ast [h_1(t) \\ast (t \\ast h_1(t))]\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies further using the commutative property of convolution:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = x(t) \\ast [(t \\ast h_1(t)) \\ast h_1(t)]\n     \\]\n\n5. **Analyzing the Inner Convolution**:\n   - The term inside the brackets, \\(t \\ast h_1(t)\\), represents a modified impulse response.\n   - Therefore, the overall operation can be seen as applying \\(x(t)\\) to a new impulse response which is a convolution of \\(t\\) and \\(h_1(t)\\) again with \\(h_1(t)\\).\n\n6. **Comparison with Direct Application**:\n   - Applying \\(x(t)\\) directly to \\(h_2(t)\\) would give:\n     \\[\n     y(t) = x(t) \\ast h_2(t) = x(t) \\ast (t \\ast h_1(t))\n     \\]\n   - By the associative property of convolution, this is equivalent to:\n     \\[\n     y(t) = x(t) \\ast [(t \\ast h_1(t))]\n     \\]\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Both \\(z(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) simplify to the same form, showing that the overall output is indeed the same whether \\(x(t)\\) is first processed through \\(h_1(t)\\) and then through \\(h_2(t)\\), or directly through \\(h_2(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
