    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE**: We have the partial differential equation \\(\\nabla^2 u = -\\lambda u\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is a positive constant. This is a Helmholtz equation, which describes wave propagation in a homogeneous medium.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is a linear operator that transforms functions from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. For a function \\(u(x)\\), its Fourier transform \\(\\hat{u}(k)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x) e^{-ikx} dx\n   \\]\n   Similarly, the inverse Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\) transforms back to the spatial domain.\n\n3. **Transforming Initial Condition**: If we apply the Fourier transform to the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\), we get \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\). The transformed equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   -k^2 \\hat{u}(k,t) = -\\lambda \\hat{u}(k,t)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   k^2 \\hat{u}(k,t) = \\lambda \\hat{u}(k,t)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (k^2 - \\lambda) \\hat{u}(k,t) = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving in Frequency Domain**: Since \\(\\lambda\\) is a positive constant, the equation \\((k^2 - \\lambda) = 0\\) implies that \\(\\hat{u}(k,t) = A(k) e^{i\\sqrt{\\lambda}t} + B(k) e^{-i\\sqrt{\\lambda}t}\\) for some constants \\(A(k)\\) and \\(B(k)\\).\n\n5. **Inverting the Fourier Transform**: Applying the inverse Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\) to \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\) will give us the solution \\(u(x,t)\\) in the spatial domain.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original PDE**: We start with the PDE \\(\\nabla^2 u = -\\lambda u\\), which is a Helmholtz equation. This describes a wave-like behavior but with exponential decay or growth depending on \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier Transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to both sides of the equation transforms it into a simpler algebraic equation. For the Helmholtz equation, the Fourier Transform converts the spatial Laplacian \\(\\nabla^2\\) into multiplication by \\(-k^2\\), where \\(k\\) is the wave number in the frequency domain. Thus, we get:\n   \\[\n   -k^2 \\hat{u}(k) = -\\lambda \\hat{u}(k)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we have:\n   \\[\n   k^2 = \\lambda\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(\\hat{u}(k)\\) is determined up to a multiplicative factor that depends on the initial conditions.\n\n3. **Inversion Back to Spatio-Temporal Domain**: After solving the transformed equation, we apply the inverse Fourier Transform \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\) to get back to the spatio-temporal domain. This process should theoretically recover the original function \\(u(x,t)\\) that satisfies the original PDE.\n\n4. **Consistency Check**: To ensure that the solution \\(u(x,t)\\) obtained from the inverse Fourier Transform still solves the original PDE, we need to verify that the transformation and its inverse do not introduce any inconsistencies. Since the Fourier Transform is a linear operation and the inverse Fourier Transform is its exact reverse, the solution should be consistent with the original PDE provided no errors were made in the transformation or inversion process.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the Fourier Transform and its inverse are well-defined operations that preserve the properties of the original function (assuming no numerical errors), the solution \\(u(x,t)\\) obtained after applying the Fourier Transform, solving the transformed equation, and then inverting back to the spatio-temporal domain should indeed satisfy the original PDE.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

The transformation and its inverse do not alter the fundamental properties of the solution that satisfy the PDE.\n\nTherefore, the solution \\(u(x,t)\\) for \\(t > 0\\) will indeed still solve the original PDE without any external intervention.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To address this question, let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition Transformation**: The initial condition \\( u(x,0) \\) is transformed into its Fourier domain representation using the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Inversion**: The transformed function is then inverted back to the spatial domain using the inverse Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\). This should ideally return us to the original initial condition \\( u(x,0) \\).\n\n3. **Solution in Fourier Domain**: If we assume that the transformed function in the Fourier domain satisfies the transformed version of the PDE, it means that if \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( u(x, t) \\), then \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) \\) satisfies some transformed PDE in the Fourier domain.\n\n4. **Inverse Transformation and Solution**: When we invert \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) \\) back to the spatial domain using \\( \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\), we get \\( u(x, t) \\). For \\( u(x, t) \\) to still be a solution to the original PDE, it must satisfy \\( \\nabla^2 u = -\\lambda u \\) for all \\( t > 0 \\).\n\nGiven the properties of the Fourier transform and the nature of the PDE, the transformation and subsequent inversion should preserve the solution properties under ideal conditions (i.e., without any numerical errors or approximations). The key point here is whether the solution obtained through this process still satisfies the original PDE.\n\nSince the Fourier transform and its inverse are linear operators and the PDE is linear, the solution obtained after transforming, solving in the Fourier domain, and inverting back should still satisfy the original PDE provided there are no external interventions or numerical errors that alter the solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Equation**: The given PDE is \\(\\nabla^2 u = -\\lambda u\\), which is a homogeneous Helmholtz equation.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to both sides of the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[\\nabla^2 u] = \\mathcal{F}[-\\lambda u]\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Fourier transform that \\(\\mathcal{F}[\\nabla^2 u] = (k^2)\\hat{u}(k)\\) where \\(k\\) is the wave number and \\(\\hat{u}(k)\\) is the Fourier transform of \\(u(x)\\), we obtain:\n   \\[\n   k^2 \\hat{u}(k) = -\\lambda \\hat{u}(k)\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\lambda\\) is a positive constant, this implies:\n   \\[\n   k^2 + \\lambda = 0\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(\\hat{u}(k)\\) satisfies the ODE:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k) = A e^{-ik\\sqrt{\\lambda}} + B e^{ik\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\n3. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: When we apply the inverse Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\) to \\(\\hat{u}(k)\\), we get back to the spatial domain:\n   \\[\n   u(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[A e^{-ik\\sqrt{\\lambda}} + B e^{ik\\sqrt{\\lambda}}]\n   \\]\n   This function \\(u(x,t)\\) should satisfy the original PDE because the Fourier transform and its inverse are linear operators and they preserve the differential structure of the equation.\n\n4. **Initial Condition**: If the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\) is transformed by \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) and then inverted by \\(\\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\), it should recover the same function \\(u(x,0)\\) in the spatial domain. The Fourier transform of the initial condition is \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\), and applying the inverse Fourier transform gives us \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\n5. **Solution for \\(t > 0\\)**: Since the Fourier transform and its inverse do not alter the differential structure of the equation, the function \\(u(x,t)\\) obtained after transforming and inverting should still satisfy the original PDE \\(\\nabla^2 u = -\\lambda u\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution \\(u(x,t)\\) for \\(t > 0\\) will indeed still solve the original partial differential equation without any external intervention.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
