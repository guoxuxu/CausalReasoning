If \\( u(t) \\) follows a specific predefined path, it means that \\( u(t) \\) is not changing due to external interventions but is fixed according to some known function.\n\n3. **Role of Initial Condition \\( x \\)**: The term \\( e^{tA}x \\) represents the effect of the initial condition \\( x \\) on the state \\( z(t) \\). Since \\( x \\) is given, its influence on \\( z(T) \\) depends on the matrix exponential \\( e^{TA} \\) and the duration \\( T \\).\n\n4. **Constant Input Path**: If \\( u(t) \\) follows a specific predefined path without any intervention, then \\( u(t) \\) is a deterministic function of time. This means that for any given \\( t \\) within the interval [0, T], \\( u(t) \\) has a fixed value, which implies that the integral term \\( \\int_0^T e^{(T-s)A}Bu(s) \\, ds \\) is also a fixed quantity determined by the path of \\( u(t) \\).\n\n5. **Impact of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)**: The matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) determine the dynamics of the system and how the input \\( u(t) \\) affects the state \\( z(t) \\). They do not change over time if \\( u(t) \\) is fixed, so their influence on \\( z(T) \\) is also fixed.\n\n6. **Final State \\( z(T) \\)**: Given that \\( u(t) \\) is fixed, the integral term \\( \\int_0^T e^{(T-s)A}Bu(s) \\, ds \\) becomes a constant.

However, since the integral term is constant, the overall value of \\( z(T) \\) is influenced by both the initial condition \\( x \\) and the fixed input path \\( u(t) \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: For \\( z(T) \\) to remain constant irrespective of the initial condition \\( x \\), the term \\( e^{TA}x \\) must be zero for all possible \\( x \\).
