    "Let's analyze the transformations step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Function and Equation**:\n   - The function \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the partial differential equation \\( \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = Az \\).\n   - This implies that \\( z(t) = z(t_0)e^{A(t-t_0)} \\) for some initial condition \\( z(t_0) \\).\n\n2. **Transformation 1**:\n   - Applying the transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\):\n     \\[\n     g(z(t)) = e^{Bt}z(t) = e^{Bt}z(t_0)e^{A(t-t_0)} = z(t_0)e^{(A+B)(t-t_0)}\n     \\]\n   - So, after applying \\( g \\), the function becomes \\( z(t) = z(t_0)e^{(A+B)(t-t_0)} \\).\n\n3. **Intervention Transformation 2**:\n   - Introducing the transformation \\( h(z) = e^{Ct}z \\) at time \\( t_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     h(z(t_1)) = e^{Ct_1}z(t_1) = e^{Ct_1}z(t_0)e^{(A+B)(t_1-t_0)}\n     \\]\n   - Now, the function after the intervention is \\( z(t) = z(t_0)e^{(A+B)(t-t_0)}e^{C(t_1-t)} \\) for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Final Function at Time T**:\n   - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the function is:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = z(t_0)e^{(A+B)(T-t_0)}e^{C(t_1-T)}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = z(t_0)e^{(A+B)(T-t_0)-C(T-t_1)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The final function \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) through the term \\( (A+B)(T-t_0) \\).\n   - It also depends on \\( C \\) through the term \\( -C(T-t_1) \\).\n\nTherefore, the end function \\( z(T) \\) does not depend exclusively on \\( A \\) and ignores the influences of \\( B \\) or \\( C \\).
