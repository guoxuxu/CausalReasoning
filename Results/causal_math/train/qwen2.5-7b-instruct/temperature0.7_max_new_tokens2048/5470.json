    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System Behavior**: The system is described as a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system, which means its behavior is governed by convolution integrals. The output \\( y(t) \\) of such a system can be expressed as the convolution of the input \\( f(t) \\) and the system's impulse response \\( g(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   y(t) = (f * g)(t) = \\int_0^t f(\\tau) g(t - \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of Convolution**: The Laplace transform of the convolution integral is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(y)(s) = \\mathcal{L}(f * g)(s) = \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(g)(s)\n   \\]\n   This property allows us to work with the transforms directly without needing to compute the convolution in the time domain.\n\n3. **Given Information**: We have:\n   - The Laplace transform of the output \\( \\mathcal{L}(y)(s) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of the impulse response \\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\).\n\n4. **Objective**: Determine if we can precisely determine the input function \\( f(t) \\) from these transforms.\n\n5. **Reversing the Laplace Transform**: To find \\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\), we can use the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(y)(s)}{\\mathcal{L}(g)(s)}\n   \\]\n   This equation tells us that we can directly compute \\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{L}(y)(s) \\) and \\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\).\n\n6. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: Once we have \\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\), we can apply the inverse Laplace transform to obtain \\( f(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{L}(y)(s)}{\\mathcal{L}(g)(s)}\\right)\n   \\]\n   Provided that the division and inversion are well-defined and the inverse Laplace transform exists, we can precisely determine \\( f(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, given the information about \\( \\mathcal{L}(y)(s) \\) and \\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\), it is possible to precisely determine \\( f(t) \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To determine if the input function \\( f(t) \\) can be precisely determined from the given information, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **System Description**: The system is linear and time-invariant (LTI), described by a convolution integral:\n   \\[\n   (f * g)(t) = \\int_0^t f(\\tau) g(t - \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   where \\( g(t) \\) is the impulse response of the system.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Properties**:\n   - The Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their individual Laplace transforms:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{(f * g)(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(g)(s)\n     \\]\n   - Given that the output \\( y(t) \\) has been transformed to \\( \\mathcal{L}(y)(s) \\) and the impulse response \\( g(t) \\) has been transformed to \\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}(y)(s) = \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(g)(s)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Objective**: Determine if \\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\) can be precisely determined from the above equation.\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n   - From the equation \\( \\mathcal{L}(y)(s) = \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\cdot \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\), it is clear that \\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\) can be isolated as:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(y)(s)}{\\mathcal{L}(g)(s)}\n     \\]\n   - This isolation is possible because \\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\) is non-zero for all \\( s \\) (since \\( g(t) \\) is the impulse response of a stable LTI system).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the Laplace transform of the output \\( \\mathcal{L}(y)(s) \\) and the Laplace transform of the impulse response \\( \\mathcal{L}(g)(s) \\) are known, the Laplace transform of the input \\( \\mathcal{L}(f)(s) \\) can indeed be precisely determined.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
