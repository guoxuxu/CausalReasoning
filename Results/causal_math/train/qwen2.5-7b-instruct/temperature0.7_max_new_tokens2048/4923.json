    "To determine if the endpoint \\( \\mathbf{x}(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on \\( M \\) and not on \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\), let's analyze the given system step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Condition and Transformation by \\( P \\):**\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), the initial state is \\( \\mathbf{x}(0) = P\\mathbf{x}_0 \\), where \\( \\mathbf{x}_0 \\) is the initial condition before any transformations.\n   - The transformation \\( h(\\mathbf{x}) = P\\mathbf{x} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) modifies the initial condition from \\( \\mathbf{x}_0 \\) to \\( P\\mathbf{x}_0 \\).\n\n2. **System Dynamics:**\n   - The system evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M\\mathbf{x} \\).\n   - This is a linear system with the solution \\( \\mathbf{x}(t) = e^{Mt}\\mathbf{x}(0) \\), where \\( e^{Mt} \\) is the matrix exponential of \\( Mt \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Transformation \\( P \\):**\n   - Substituting the initial condition after the transformation by \\( P \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{x}(t) = e^{Mt}P\\mathbf{x}_0\n     \\]\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), the state of the system is:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{x}(t_1) = e^{Mt_1}P\\mathbf{x}_0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Intervention by Transformation \\( Q \\):**\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( k(\\mathbf{x}) = Q\\mathbf{x} \\) is applied. This transformation affects the state \\( \\mathbf{x}(t_1) \\) but does not change the dynamics of the system beyond \\( t_1 \\). Therefore, the state immediately after the transformation at \\( t = t_1 \\) becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{x}(t_1^+) = Q\\mathbf{x}(t_1) = Qe^{Mt_1}P\\mathbf{x}_0\n     \\]\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the system continues to evolve according to \\( \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = M\\mathbf{x} \\), so the state at time \\( T > t_1 \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{x}(T) = e^{M(T-t_1)}\\mathbf{x}(t_1^+) = e^{M(T-t_1)}Qe^{Mt_1}P\\mathbf{x}_0\n     \\]\n\n5. **Endpoint Analysis:**\n   - The endpoint \\( \\mathbf{x}(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) can be written as:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{x}(T) = e^{MT}PQ^{-1}Qe^{Mt_1}P\\mathbf{x}_0 = e^{MT}PQ^{-1}Qe^{Mt_1}P\\mathbf{x}_0\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( e^{MT} \\) depends only on \\( M \\) and \\( T \\), and \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are constants that affect the initial condition and the intermediate state, the final state \\( \\mathbf{x}(T) \\) still depends on \\( M \\) through \\( e^{MT} \\) and \\( e^{Mt_1} \\).\n\nTherefore, the endpoint \\( \\mathbf{x}(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on \\( M \\) and also on \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) through their effects on the initial and intermediate states.
