Therefore, the path on the \\( w \\)-plane does not cover all points in the unit disk more than once; it only covers the boundary of the unit disk, not the interior.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Transformation**:\n   - We start with the function \\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\).\n   - This function maps the real interval \\([0, 2\\pi]\\) onto the unit circle in the complex plane. Specifically, as \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 2\\pi \\), \\( z(x) \\) traces out the unit circle starting at \\( 1 \\) and ending back at \\( 1 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( w(z) = z^2 \\)**:\n   - Applying the transformation \\( w(z) = z^2 \\) to \\( z(x) = e^{ix} \\), we get \\( w(e^{ix}) = (e^{ix})^2 = e^{i2x} \\).\n   - As \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 2\\pi \\), \\( 2x \\) ranges from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 4\\pi \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( w(z) = e^{i2x} \\) traces out the unit circle twice, starting and ending at \\( 1 \\).\n\n3. **Coverage of the Unit Disk**:\n   - The question asks whether the path on the \\( w \\)-plane covers all points in the unit disk.\n   - The unit disk is the set of all complex numbers \\( w \\) such that \\( |w| \\leq 1 \\).\n   - Since \\( w(z) = e^{i2x} \\) traces out the unit circle exactly twice, every point on the unit circle is covered twice, but no point inside the unit circle is covered.\n\nGiven these steps, the path on the \\( w \\)-plane does not cover all points in the unit disk; it only covers the boundary of the unit disk (the unit circle itself).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
