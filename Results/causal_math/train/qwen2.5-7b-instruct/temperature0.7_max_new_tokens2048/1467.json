This implies that the system is being influenced by the term \\( e^{Bt} \\) in addition to the original \\( e^{At} \\).\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention with a new function \\( g(t) = e^{Ct} \\) is applied.

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial System Response**: The initial system response is governed by \\( z(t) = e^{At} \\).

However, this function does not directly influence the state of the system as described. Instead, it might represent an external input or disturbance to the system, but its form does not change the inherent dynamics of the system itself, which are determined by the matrix \\( A \\).\n\n3. **Post-Intervention Dynamics**: After the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the system continues to evolve according to its original dynamics, meaning the state of the system at any time \\( T > t_1 \\) will still be governed by the same matrix \\( A \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{A(T - t_1)} \\cdot z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( z(t_1) \\) is the state of the system just before the intervention, which was \\( e^{At_1} \\).\n\n4. **Effect of \\( B \\)**: The matrix \\( B \\) is mentioned in the problem, but there is no indication that it influences the system's state post-intervention.
