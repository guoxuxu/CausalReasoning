The new total capacitance \\(C_{total}\\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{C_{total}} = \\frac{1}{C} + \\frac{1}{C'}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   C_{total} = \\frac{CC'}{C + C'}\n   \\]\n\n3. **New Impedance Function**: With the new total capacitance \\(C_{total}\\), the new impedance function \\(Z(\\omega, t)\\) at any time \\(t > t_1\\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z(\\omega, t) = R + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C_{total}} + j\\omega L\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(C_{total}\\):\n   \\[\n   Z(\\omega, t) = R + \\frac{1}{j\\omega \\left(\\frac{CC'}{C + C'}\\right)} + j\\omega L\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the term involving capacitance:\n   \\[\n   Z(\\omega, t) = R + \\frac{C + C'}{j\\omega CC'} + j\\omega L\n   \\]\n   Notice that the new impedance function includes \\(C'\\), which was not part of the original impedance function.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the new impedance function \\(Z(\\omega, t)\\) at any time \\(t > t_1\\) includes the additional capacitance \\(C'\\), it is not solely determined by the original components \\(R\\), \\(C\\), and \\(L\\). The presence of \\(C'\\) affects the impedance function.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Impedance Function**: The initial impedance function is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(\\omega) = R + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C} + j\\omega L\n   \\]\n   This function depends on the resistance \\(R\\), capacitance \\(C\\), and inductance \\(L\\).\n\n2. **Adding a Capacitor in Parallel**: At time \\(t_1\\), a new capacitor with a different value, say \\(C'\\), is added in parallel. The impedance of a capacitor is given by \\(\\frac{1}{j\\omega C'}\\). When capacitors are in parallel, their impedances add up in the reciprocal form. So, the new total capacitance can be considered as \\(C_{total} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{C} + \\frac{1}{C'}}\\).\n\n3. **New Impedance Function**: The new impedance function after adding the capacitor in parallel would then be:\n   \\[\n   Z'(\\omega) = R + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C_{total}} + j\\omega L\n   \\]\n   Here, the new impedance function depends on the original capacitance \\(C\\) (now replaced by \\(C_{total}\\)) and the original inductance \\(L\\), along with the resistance \\(R\\).\n\n4. **Time Dependency**: The problem asks about the impedance function \\(Z(\\omega, t)\\) at any time \\(t > t_1\\). Since the addition of the capacitor happens at a specific time \\(t_1\\), it affects the system's behavior starting from that point. However, the question specifically asks if the resulting impedance function at any time \\(t > t_1\\) will solely be determined by the original components \\(R\\), \\(C\\), and \\(L\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The impedance function \\(Z(\\omega, t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) will indeed depend on the new total capacitance \\(C_{total}\\), which is derived from the original capacitance \\(C\\) and the new capacitance \\(C'\\). Therefore, the impedance function cannot solely be determined by the original components \\(R\\), \\(C\\), and \\(L\\) alone.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
