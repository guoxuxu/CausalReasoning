    "Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial System Dynamics**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = iAz \\). This is a first-order linear differential equation with the solution:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0) e^{iAt}\n   \\]\n   where \\( z(0) \\) is the initial condition.\n\n2. **Introducing \\( f(z) \\)**: When we multiply \\( z(t) \\) by \\( f(z) = e^{iBt}z \\), the new function becomes:\n   \\[\n   h(t) = e^{iBt}z(t) = e^{iBt}z(0)e^{iAt} = z(0)e^{i(A+B)t}\n   \\]\n   So, the effect of \\( f(z) \\) is to modify the exponent in the evolution of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Introducing \\( g(z) \\)**: Now, if we introduce \\( g(z) = e^{iCt}z \\) as an intervention at time \\( t_1 \\), the system will evolve differently after \\( t_1 \\).
