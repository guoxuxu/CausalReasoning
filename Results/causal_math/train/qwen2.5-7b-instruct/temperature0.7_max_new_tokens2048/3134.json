Without knowing \\( c \\), we cannot separate \\( \\hat{f}(k) \\) from \\( \\frac{\\hat{g}(k)}{c k} \\sin(c k T) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the reconstruction of \\( u(x,0) \\) requires knowing \\( \\hat{f}(k) \\) and \\( \\hat{g}(k) \\) independently, and the term involving \\( \\frac{\\hat{g}(k)}{c k} \\sin(c k T) \\) depends on \\( c \\), we cannot exactly reconstruct \\( u(x,0) \\) without knowing \\( c \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Wave Equation**: The given wave equation is \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\). This describes how the displacement \\(u(x,t)\\) changes over time and space.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform to both sides of the wave equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}\\right] = c^2 \\mathcal{F}\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\right]\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Fourier transform, specifically that the Fourier transform of the second derivative with respect to time is \\((ik)^2\\) and the second derivative with respect to space is \\(-k^2\\), we obtain:\n   \\[\n   (ik)^2 \\hat{u}(k,t) = -c^2 k^2 \\hat{u}(k,t)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   -k^2 \\hat{u}(k,t) = -c^2 k^2 \\hat{u}(k,t)\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k,t) = e^{-i c k t} \\hat{u}(k,0)\n   \\]\n   Where \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\) is the Fourier transform of the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\n3. **Reconstructing Initial Condition**: To reconstruct the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\) from \\(\\hat{u}(k,T)\\), we need to take the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   u(x,0) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k,T)]\n   \\]\n   However, the relationship derived above involves the wave speed \\(c\\). Specifically, \\(\\hat{u}(k,T) = e^{-i c k T} \\hat{u}(k,0)\\). Without knowing \\(c\\), we cannot directly compute \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\) from \\(\\hat{u}(k,T)\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the Fourier transform of the initial condition \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\) is modulated by \\(e^{-i c k T}\\), which depends on the unknown wave speed \\(c\\), it is impossible to exactly reconstruct \\(u(x,0)\\) from \\(\\hat{u}(k,T)\\) alone without knowing \\(c\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
