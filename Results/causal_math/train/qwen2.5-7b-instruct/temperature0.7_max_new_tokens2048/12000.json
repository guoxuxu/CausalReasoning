However, it does not directly provide information about the time-domain behavior of \\(z(t)\\) from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=T\\). Instead, it provides a relationship between the initial condition \\(z(0)\\) and the parameters \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\n4. **Inversion to Time Domain**: To understand the time-domain behavior, we need to invert \\(L(z)(s)\\) back to the time domain.
