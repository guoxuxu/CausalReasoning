    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System Dynamics:**\n   - The system is described by two differential equations: \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\).\n   - These are linear time-invariant (LTI) systems since A and B are constant matrices.\n   - The solution to these differential equations will be exponential functions of time multiplied by the initial conditions.\n\n2. **Solution Form:**\n   - For \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\), the solution is \\( x(t) = Xe^{At} \\), where \\( X \\) is the vector of initial conditions \\( x(0) \\).\n   - Similarly, for \\( \\dot{y} = By \\), the solution is \\( y(t) = Ye^{Bt} \\), where \\( Y \\) is the vector of initial conditions \\( y(0) \\).\n\n3. **Integral Transform Definition:**\n   - The integral transform \\( F(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\) is applied to \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\).\n   - Substituting the solutions for \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), we get:\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (Xe^{At} + iYe^{Bt}) dt\n     \\]\n   - This can be split into two integrals:\n     \\[\n     F(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} Xe^{At} dt + i \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} Ye^{Bt} dt\n     \\]\n\n4. **Evaluating the Integrals:**\n   - Each integral depends on the form of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).
