Assuming \\( t \\) is real and considering the standard Fourier transform of \\( e^{ixt} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{ixt}\\}(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{ixt} e^{-ist} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-it(s-x)} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral does not converge in the usual sense for all \\( s \\) and \\( x \\), but for specific cases (like the Dirac delta function), it can be interpreted.\n\n5. **Fourier Transform of Transformed Function**: Now, let's consider the Fourier transform of \\( f(z^*) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{e^y (\\cos x + i \\sin x)\\}(t)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( y \\) is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral, and the Fourier transform of \\( \\cos x \\) and \\( \\sin x \\) are known. However, the key point here is that the phase shift introduced by \\( z^* \\) changes the form of the function significantly.\n\n6. **Comparison**: The Fourier transform of \\( f(z) \\) and \\( f(z^*) \\) will generally not be the same because the phase shift and the additional exponential term \\( e^y \\) change the nature of the function.\n\nTherefore, the Fourier transform of \\( f(z^*) \\) at \\( t = T \\) will not be the same as the Fourier transform of the original function \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = T \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the Fourier transform of \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = T \\) is the same as the Fourier transform of \\( f(\\overline{z}) \\) at \\( t = T \\), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Original Function**: \n   The original function is given by \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\).\n\n2. **Apply Complex Conjugation**:\n   When we apply the complex conjugate to \\( z \\), we get \\( f(\\overline{z}) = e^{i\\overline{z}} \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of the Original Function**:\n   The Fourier transform of \\( f(z) \\) with respect to \\( z \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(z) e^{-i\\omega z} dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iz} e^{-i\\omega z} dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(z - \\omega)z} dz.\n   \\]\n   This integral converges only for specific conditions, but for the sake of our analysis, let's assume it has a known form.\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of the Conjugated Function**:\n   Similarly, the Fourier transform of \\( f(\\overline{z}) \\) with respect to \\( z \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F_{\\text{conjugate}}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\overline{z}) e^{-i\\omega z} dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\overline{z}} e^{-i\\omega z} dz.\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\overline{z} \\) is not a real number and the integral is taken over the complex plane, this expression does not simplify easily into a form that can be directly compared to the Fourier transform of the original function without additional context about the domain of integration.\n\n5. **Implications for Time Domain**:\n   If we consider the Fourier transform in terms of time \\( t \\), the Fourier transform of \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = T \\) would be the value of the Fourier transform evaluated at \\( \\omega = 2\\pi T \\). For \\( f(\\overline{z}) \\), the same would apply, but due to the nature of complex conjugation, the resulting function in the time domain might not be the same.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Generally, the Fourier transform properties do not preserve the form under complex conjugation in the same way they do for real functions. Therefore, the Fourier transform of \\( f(\\overline{z}) \\) at \\( t = T \\) is not necessarily the same as the Fourier transform of \\( f(z) \\) at \\( t = T \\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\)\n2. **Complex Conjugation**: Apply the complex conjugate to \\( z \\), which gives \\( z^* \\).\n3. **Transformed Function**: The new function after complex conjugation is \\( f(z^*) = e^{i z^*} \\).\n4. **Fourier Transform**: We need to find the Fourier transform of both the original and the transformed functions.\n5. **Fourier Transform of Original Function**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\) with respect to \\( z \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{iz}\\}(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iz} e^{-2\\pi i z t} dz\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the integrand:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{iz(1 - 2\\pi t)} dz\n     \\]\n   - This integral evaluates to a delta function:\n     \\[\n     \\delta(1 - 2\\pi t)\n     \\]\n6. **Fourier Transform of Transformed Function**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( f(z^*) = e^{i z^*} \\) with respect to \\( z^* \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i z^*}\\}(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i z^*} e^{-2\\pi i z^* t} d(z^*)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the integrand:\n     \\[\n     \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i z^*(1 - 2\\pi t)} d(z^*)\n     \\]\n   - This integral also evaluates to a delta function:\n     \\[\n     \\delta(1 - 2\\pi t)\n     \\]\n\nGiven that both the Fourier transforms of the original function and the transformed function evaluate to the same delta function, we can conclude that the Fourier transform at \\( t = T \\) for both the original and the transformed function is the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
