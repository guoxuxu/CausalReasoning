    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Integro-Differential Equation**: The given equation is \\(\\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p(t)y = \\int_0^t k(s) y(s) ds\\). This equation describes how the second derivative of \\(y\\) with respect to time is influenced not only by the current value of \\(y\\) but also by its integral from 0 to \\(t\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\(F(\\omega)\\) is defined as \\(F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} y(t) dt\\). It transforms the time-domain function \\(y(t)\\) into the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\(t_1\\)**: If an intervention changes \\(y(t_1)\\), it will affect the values of \\(y(t)\\) for all \\(t > t_1\\).

However, the Fourier transform is a snapshot of the entire function \\(y(t)\\) up to the point of transformation.

Since the system is driven by its past states (due to the integral term), changing \\( y(t_1) \\) will have a cascading effect on subsequent values of \\( y(t) \\).\n\n6. **Determinism vs. Predetermination**: While the new \\( F(\\omega) \\) reflects the new state of the system after the intervention, it does not \"predetermine\" the exact state of \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) because the future evolution still depends on the specific form of \\( p(t) \\) and \\( k(t) \\), which are given functions. The new \\( F(\\omega) \\) only provides a different representation of the system's current state, not a direct prediction of future states without further integration of the system's dynamics.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: The system is governed by an integro-differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p(t)y = \\int_0^t k(s) y(s) ds\n   \\]\n   This means that the second derivative of \\( y \\) with respect to time depends not only on \\( y(t) \\) but also on its integral over past values.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: At \\( t = 0 \\), the Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega) \\) of \\( y(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} y(t) dt\n   \\]\n   This transform converts the time-domain representation of \\( y(t) \\) into a frequency-domain representation.\n\n3. **Intervention at \\( t_1 \\)**: An intervention changes the value of \\( y(t_1) \\). Since the system is described by an integro-differential equation, any change in \\( y(t) \\) will propagate through time due to the integral term and the differential term.\n\n4. **Impact of Intervention on Fourier Transform**: Recalculating \\( F(\\omega) \\) based on the new \\( y(t_1) \\) will reflect the change in the frequency-domain representation. However, the Fourier transform itself does not directly determine the future states of \\( y(t) \\) without solving the original integro-differential equation again.\n\n5. **Determining Future States**: The future state of \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is influenced by both the initial conditions and the dynamics of the system. The Fourier transform, while providing information about the frequency content of the signal, does not alone determine the exact future state of \\( y(t) \\) because it does not account for the specific form of the integro-differential equation and the ongoing influence of \\( p(t) \\) and \\( k(t) \\).\n\nGiven these points, the new computation of \\( F(\\omega) \\) based on the intervention at \\( t_1 \\) does not predetermine the exact state of \\( y(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
