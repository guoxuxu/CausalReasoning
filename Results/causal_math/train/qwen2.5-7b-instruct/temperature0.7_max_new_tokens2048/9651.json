The intervention modifies the system starting from \\( t_1 \\), but the Laplace transform for \\( t > t_1 \\) is influenced by the factor \\( e^{-(s+1)t} \\) which includes the new exponent \\( (s+1) \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Since the Laplace transform for \\( t > t_1 \\) includes the additional factor \\( e^{-(s+1)t} \\) due to the intervention, the Laplace transform at \\( s = c + di \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) will indeed depend on the intervening function \\( k(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
