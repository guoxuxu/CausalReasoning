This means that after applying \\( h \\), the function becomes \\( z(t) = ce^{iwt}z_0 \\).\n\n3. **Another Transformation at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At some time \\( t_1 \\), another transformation \\( k(z) = dz \\) is applied.

Let's denote the state at \\( t_1 \\) as \\( z(t_1) \\).\n\n4. **State at \\( t_1 \\)**: The state at \\( t_1 \\) would be \\( z(t_1) = e^{iwt_1}z_0 \\).

Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = de^{iwt_1}e^{iwt}z_0 = de^{iwt}z_0\n   \\]\n   This shows that the function at any \\( t > t_1 \\) is \\( z(t) = de^{iwt}z_0 \\).\n\n6. **Final Question**: Does the function form at any \\( t > t_1 \\) be solely determined by \\( w \\), regardless of \\( c \\) and \\( d \\)?\n\nFrom the above steps, we see that the function at any \\( t > t_1 \\) is indeed determined by \\( w \\), but it is also influenced by the product of the constants \\( c \\) and \\( d \\).

This function represents a complex exponential with angular frequency \\( w \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Transformation \\( h(z) \\)**: When the transformation \\( h(z) = cz \\) is applied, it scales the complex function by a non-zero complex constant \\( c \\).
