The integral transformation is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^2 \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Change in Function**: We intervene by changing \\( f(t) \\) from \\( t^2 \\) to \\( 2t^2 \\) at time \\( t = 0 \\). This means that for \\( t > 0 \\), \\( f(t) = t^2 \\), but at \\( t = 0 \\), there is an impulse (or delta function) due to the change.\n\n3. **Effect of Delta Function**: When we change \\( f(t) \\) from \\( t^2 \\) to \\( 2t^2 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), it introduces a delta function \\( \\delta(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) because the function changes abruptly. So, the new function can be written as:\n   \\[\n   f(t) = t^2 + \\delta(t)\n   \\]\n   for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\n4. **Transformed Function with Delta Function**: The new integral transformation becomes:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (t^2 + \\delta(t)) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This can be split into two integrals:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^2 \\, dt + \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} \\delta(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   The first integral is the original transform without the delta function, which we know is:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} t^2 \\, dt = \\frac{2}{s^3}\n   \\]\n   The second integral evaluates to 1 because the delta function integrates to 1 over any interval containing 0:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} \\delta(t) \\, dt = 1\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the new transform is:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\frac{2}{s^3} + 1\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Changing \\( f(t) \\) from \\( t^2 \\) to \\( 2t^2 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) introduces a constant term of 1 to the transform \\( F(s) \\). This change is independent of the value of \\( s \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the value of \\( F(s) \\) will indeed change regardless of the initial or final value of \\( s \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
