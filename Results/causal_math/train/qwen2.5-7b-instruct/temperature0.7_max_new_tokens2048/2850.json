It involves a Gaussian function that spreads out over time due to diffusion. Specifically, the solution is:\n   \\[\n   u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi kt}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{(x-y)^2}{4kt}} e^{-ay^2} dy\n   \\]\n   This integral can be solved analytically, but the important point is that the initial Gaussian shape will spread out as time progresses.\n\n3. **Inversion Problem**: The key question is whether we can uniquely recover the initial condition from the final temperature distribution \\(u(x,T)\\). In general, this is not possible for a parabolic PDE like the heat equation. The heat equation is an ill-posed inverse problem in this context because small changes in the initial condition can lead to large changes in the solution over time, making it impossible to uniquely reconstruct the initial condition from the final state alone.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Without additional constraints or information (such as boundary conditions or other measurements at different times), it is not possible to uniquely determine the exact initial condition \\(u(x,0) = e^{-ax^2}\\) from the temperature distribution at time \\(T\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

The initial condition is given by \\(u(x,0) = e^{-ax^2}\\).\n\n2. **Solution Formulation**: The general solution to the heat equation with the given initial condition can be expressed using the method of separation of variables or Fourier transforms. However, for our purposes, it's more important to understand that the form of the initial condition \\(e^{-ax^2}\\) is preserved under the heat equation evolution, but it may spread out due to diffusion.\n\n3. **Diffusion Effect**: Over time \\(T\\), the initial Gaussian distribution \\(e^{-ax^2}\\) will spread out due to the diffusion term \\(ku_{xx}\\).
