Assuming \\( A < 0 \\), the Fourier transform is:\n\\[ F(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{A - i(B - \\omega)} \\]\n\nTo find the peak of the Fourier transform, we need to maximize the magnitude of \\( F(\\omega) \\):\n\\[ |F(\\omega)| = \\left| \\frac{1}{A - i(B - \\omega)} \\right| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(A)^2 + (B - \\omega)^2}} \\]\n\nThe magnitude is minimized when the denominator is maximized, which occurs when \\( \\omega = B \\). Therefore, the peak of the Fourier transform occurs at \\( \\omega = B \\).\n\n### Step 2: Modified Function and Fourier Transform\nNow consider the modified function at \\( t = t_1 \\):\n\\[ z(t) = e^{(A + 2iB)t} \\text{ for } t \\geq t_1 \\]\n\nThe Fourier transform of this modified function is:\n\\[ F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t_1} e^{(A + iB)t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt + \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{(A + 2iB)t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt \\]\n\nFor \\( t < t_1 \\):\n\\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{t_1} e^{(A + iB)t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\frac{1}{A + i(B - \\omega)} \\]\n\nFor \\( t \\geq t_1 \\):\n\\[ \\int_{t_1}^{\\infty} e^{(A + 2iB)t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\frac{e^{(A + 2iB)t_1}}{A + 2i(B - \\omega)} \\]\n\nThus, the total Fourier transform is:\n\\[ F(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{A + i(B - \\omega)} + \\frac{e^{(A + 2iB)t_1}}{A + 2i(B - \\omega)} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Peak of the Modified Fourier Transform\nTo determine if the peak still occurs at \\( \\omega = B \\), we need to examine the behavior of \\( F(\\omega) \\) around \\( \\omega = B \\). Given the form of the modified function, the term \\( e^{(A + 2iB)t_1} \\) introduces a phase shift and amplitude scaling but does not fundamentally change the location of the peak, as long as the dominant behavior near \\( \\omega = B \\) remains similar.\n\nSince the peak of the Fourier transform is determined by the behavior of the function near the frequency where the phase and amplitude are optimized, and the modification does not fundamentally alter the nature of this optimization, the peak should still occur at \\( \\omega = B \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the analysis, the peak of the Fourier Transform will still occur at the same \\( \\omega = B \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```\n\nThe answer is \"No\" because the peak of the Fourier Transform does not necessarily remain at the same \\( \\omega \\) after the modification.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with \\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\). This is a complex exponential function.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of Initial Function**:\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) = e^{(A+iB)t} \\) (for \\( t \\geq 0 \\)) is given by:\n     \\[\n     F(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(A+iB)t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the integrand:\n     \\[\n     F(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(A+i(B-\\omega))t} dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral converges only if \\( A < 0 \\). Assuming \\( A < 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     F(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{-A + i(B - \\omega)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Intervention**: At time \\( t_1 \\), we modify \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z(t) = e^{(A+2iB)t} \\). This changes the exponent from \\( (A+iB)t \\) to \\( (A+2iB)t \\).\n\n4. **Effect on Fourier Transform**:\n   - The new Fourier Transform after the intervention is:\n     \\[\n     F'(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(A+2iB)t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the integrand:\n     \\[\n     F'(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(A+2i(B-\\omega))t} dt\n     \\]\n   - Again, assuming \\( A < 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     F'(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{-A + i(2B - \\omega)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Comparison of Fourier Transforms**:\n   - The original Fourier Transform was \\( F(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{-A + i(B - \\omega)} \\).\n   - The modified Fourier Transform is \\( F'(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{-A + i(2B - \\omega)} \\).\n\n6. **Peak of the Fourier Transform**:\n   - The peak of the Fourier Transform occurs when the denominator is minimized in magnitude.\n   - For \\( F(\\omega) \\), the peak occurs when \\( | -A + i(B - \\omega) | \\) is minimized.\n   - For \\( F'(\\omega) \\), the peak occurs when \\( | -A + i(2B - \\omega) | \\) is minimized.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the form of the denominator has changed from \\( -A + i(B - \\omega) \\) to \\( -A + i(2B - \\omega) \\), the location of the peak in \\( \\omega \\) will also change. Specifically, the peak will now be at \\( \\omega = 2B \\) instead of \\( \\omega = B \\).\n\nTherefore, the peak of the Fourier Transform will not occur at the same \\( \\omega \\) after the intervention.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
