    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Function \\(z(t)\\):**\n   The function is given as \\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a complex constant. This represents a complex exponential function with a frequency component.\n\n2. **Apply the Fourier Transform:**\n   The Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} z(t) \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\xi t} e^{i \\omega t} \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{i (\\omega - \\xi) t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges only if \\(\\omega = \\xi\\), and in that case, the result is a Dirac delta function:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}(z)(\\xi) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\xi - \\omega)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Damping Factor Consideration:**\n   The problem mentions a damping factor, but it does not specify how this factor is applied. Typically, a damping factor would modify the amplitude of the oscillations. However, since the given function \\(z(t)\\) is already a pure exponential without any damping term (like \\(e^{-\\alpha t}\\)), we need to consider if there was an implicit assumption or additional context about damping.\n\n4. **Effect of Frequency vs Damping:**\n   In the absence of explicit damping in the function \\(z(t)\\), the Fourier transform clearly shows the peak at \\(\\xi = \\omega\\). If there were a damping factor, it would typically be represented as \\(z(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} e^{i \\omega t}\\), which would result in a different Fourier transform involving a Gaussian envelope.\n\n5. **Determining the Effect:**\n   Given the standard form of the Fourier transform for \\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\), the peak of the Fourier transform directly corresponds to the frequency \\(\\omega\\). Any damping effect would need to be explicitly included in the function \\(z(t)\\), and its presence would alter the shape of the Fourier transform rather than just shifting the peak.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the Fourier transform of \\(z(t) = e^{i \\omega t}\\) shows a clear peak at \\(\\omega\\) without any indication of damping, we cannot use the peak alone to determine whether the frequency \\(\\omega\\) or a damping coefficient \\(\\alpha\\) had a greater effect.

This means that the frequency content of the original function \\( z(t) \\) is entirely concentrated at \\( \\xi = \\alpha \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Damping:**\n   - The damping effect in the original function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\alpha t} \\) is not directly visible in the Fourier transform because the Fourier transform only reveals the frequency content. The damping factor \\( \\alpha \\) affects the amplitude decay of the function over time, but it does not change the frequency content.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the Fourier transform result, we cannot distinguish between the effect of the original frequency \\( \\alpha \\) and the damping coefficient \\( \\alpha \\) based on the peak of the Fourier transformed function alone.
