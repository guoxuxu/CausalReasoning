  "Explanation": "Since the force \\\\( F(x,t) \\\\) is zero across all time, it does not contribute to the system's dynamics. Thus, the string's behavior only depends on its natural properties described by the wave equation without the force, leading to the same displacement as if no force were applied.",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The system starts with an initial displacement \\(u(x,0)\\) and no initial velocity, i.e., \\(u_t(x,0) = 0\\).\n\n2. **Modified Equation**: When \\(F(x,t) = 0\\), the modified equation reduces to the original wave equation:\n   \\[\n   u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Homogeneous Equation**: This is a homogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) because there is no external forcing term.\n\n4. **Solution Form**: The solution to the homogeneous wave equation with the given initial conditions can be expressed using d'Alembert's formula for the wave equation:\n   \\[\n   u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} [f(x+ct) + f(x-ct)]\n   \\]\n   where \\(f(x) = u(x,0)\\) (since \\(u_t(x,0) = 0\\)).\n\n5. **Effect of External Force**: If \\(F(x,t) \\neq 0\\), the solution to the non-homogeneous equation would involve an additional term that accounts for the effect of the external force. However, since \\(F(x,t) = 0\\) in this case, there is no additional term due to the external force.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the external force \\(F(x,t)\\) is zero throughout the evolution of the system, the dynamics of the system remain governed solely by the initial conditions and the wave equation itself. Therefore, the displacement at any later time \\(T\\) should be exactly the same as it would be without the application of any external force.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions and Equation**:\n   - The original equation without any external force is \\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\).\n   - With the external force \\( F(x,t) = 0 \\), the modified equation becomes \\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\).\n   - Initial conditions are \\( u(x,0) = u_0(x) \\) and \\( u_t(x,0) = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Implication of No External Force**:\n   - Since \\( F(x,t) = 0 \\), the modified equation \\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\) reduces to the original wave equation.\n   - The absence of the external force means that the only forces acting on the string are the internal restoring forces due to its elasticity.\n\n3. **Solution to the Wave Equation**:\n   - The solution to the wave equation \\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\) with the given initial conditions can be expressed using d'Alembert's formula or separation of variables, but the key point is that the solution depends solely on the initial displacement and the initial velocity (which is zero here).\n\n4. **Comparison with Forced System**:\n   - If we consider a system with a non-zero external force \\( F(x,t) \\neq 0 \\), the solution would be different because the external force introduces additional terms that affect the evolution of \\( u(x,t) \\).\n   - However, in this specific case where \\( F(x,t) = 0 \\), there is no additional term introduced by the external force.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the external force \\( F(x,t) = 0 \\) does not introduce any additional terms to the wave equation, the solution to the modified equation \\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\) with the given initial conditions should be identical to the solution of the original wave equation \\( u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} \\).\n\nTherefore, the displacement \\( u(x,T) \\) at any later time \\( T \\) will indeed be the same as if no force had been applied.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The system starts with an initial displacement \\( u(x,0) \\) and no initial velocity.
