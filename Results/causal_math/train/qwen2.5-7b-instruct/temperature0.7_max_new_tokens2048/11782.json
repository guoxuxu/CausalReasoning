This transforms the original differential equation into:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(z \\cdot e^{Rt}) = P(z \\cdot e^{Rt}) + Q\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left-hand side using the product rule:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz}{dt} \\cdot e^{Rt} + z \\cdot Re^{Rt} = Pz \\cdot e^{Rt} + Q\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q\\), substituting this in gives:\n   \\[\n   (Pz + Q)e^{Rt} + zRe^{Rt} = Pz \\cdot e^{Rt} + Q\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   Pze^{Rt} + Qe^{Rt} + zRe^{Rt} = Pze^{Rt} + Q\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   Qe^{Rt} + zRe^{Rt} = Q\n   \\]\n   Since this must hold for all \\(t\\), it implies that the term involving \\(z\\) cancels out, leaving us with:\n   \\[\n   Qe^{Rt} = Q\n   \\]\n   For non-trivial solutions, this means \\(Q = 0\\).\n\n3. **Intervention at \\(t_1\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), an additional transformation \\(g(z) = z \\cdot e^{St}\\) is applied.

The transformations \\(f(z)\\) and \\(g(z)\\) only scale the solution but do not change its dependency on \\(P\\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"} because the final state \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) does depend on \\(P\\), but it also depends on \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) through the transformations applied at \\(t_1\\). However, if the question strictly asks whether the dependency on \\(P\\) alone remains unchanged, then the answer would be \"Yes\". Given the phrasing of the question, we should consider the direct dependency on \\(P\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
