    "Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p \\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = f(t)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are constants, and \\( f(t) \\) is a function of time.\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform:**\n   Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   s^2 Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) + p(sY(s) - y(0)) + qY(s) = F(s)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we obtain:\n   \\[\n   (s^2 + ps + q)Y(s) = F(s) + sy(0) + y'(0) - py(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{F(s) + sy(0) + y'(0) - py(0)}{s^2 + ps + q}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Intervention: Adding a Damping Factor \\( e^{-at} \\):**\n   Suppose we add a damping factor \\( e^{-at} \\) to \\( f(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   f(t) \\rightarrow f(t) e^{-at}\n   \\]\n   The new forcing function becomes \\( g(t) = f(t) e^{-at} \\).\n\n4. **Transforming the New Equation:**\n   Taking the Laplace transform of the new differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p \\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = f(t) e^{-at}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   (s^2 + ps + q)Y(s) = G(s) + sy(0) + y'(0) - py(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{G(s) + sy(0) + y'(0) - py(0)}{s^2 + ps + q}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t) e^{-at}\\} = F(s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s+a} \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{F(s) \\cdot \\frac{1}{s+a}}{s^2 + ps + q}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Solution Dependence:**\n   The final solution \\( y(t) \\) is now dependent on the additional term \\( \\frac{1}{s+a} \\), which introduces the parameter \\( a \\). This means that the final solution \\( y(t) \\) will not only depend on the original parameters \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) but also on the new parameter \\( a \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
