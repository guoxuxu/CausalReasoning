    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position Transformation**: We start with \\( x(t) = e^{\\alpha t} x_0 \\). This describes how the position \\( x \\) changes with time \\( t \\) under the initial transformation parameter \\( \\alpha \\).\n\n2. **Intervention Transformation**: At time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation is applied: \\( y(t) = e^{\\beta t} x(t) \\). This means that the position \\( x(t) \\) is further modified by the factor \\( e^{\\beta t} \\).\n\n3. **Final Position Calculation**:\n   - First, we need to determine the position \\( x(t) \\) at any time \\( t \\).\n   - Then, apply the intervention transformation at \\( t_1 \\) to get the new position.\n   - Finally, determine the position at time \\( T \\).\n\n4. **Position at Time \\( T \\)**:\n   - Before the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the position is \\( x(t) = e^{\\alpha t} x_0 \\).\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), the position is \\( x(t_1) = e^{\\alpha t_1} x_0 \\).\n   - The intervention applies \\( y(t) = e^{\\beta t} x(t) \\), so at \\( t = t_1 \\), the new position becomes \\( y(t_1) = e^{\\beta t_1} x(t_1) = e^{\\beta t_1} e^{\\alpha t_1} x_0 = e^{(\\alpha + \\beta) t_1} x_0 \\).\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the position continues to evolve as \\( x(t) = e^{\\alpha t} x_0 \\), but now starting from \\( y(t_1) \\).\n\n5. **Final Position at Time \\( T \\)**:\n   - The position at time \\( T \\) after the intervention is \\( x(T) = e^{\\alpha T} y(t_1) = e^{\\alpha T} e^{(\\alpha + \\beta) t_1} x_0 = e^{\\alpha T + (\\alpha + \\beta) t_1} x_0 \\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\( x(T) = e^{\\alpha (T - t_1) + \\beta t_1 + \\alpha t_1} x_0 = e^{\\alpha (T - t_1) + \\alpha t_1 + \\beta t_1} x_0 \\).\n\n6. **Dependence Analysis**:\n   - The final position \\( x(T) \\) depends on both \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) through the terms \\( \\alpha (T - t_1) \\) and \\( \\beta t_1 \\).\n   - Therefore, the final position \\( x(T) \\) does depend on both \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
