    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original PDE**: The given PDE is \\( u_t + a u_x = 0 \\). This is a first-order linear PDE which can be solved using the method of characteristics. The general solution is \\( u(x,t) = f(x - at) \\), where \\( f \\) is an arbitrary function.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\( u(x,t) \\) gives us \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-i\\xi x} dx \\).\n\n3. **Effect of the PDE on the Fourier Transform**: Using the properties of Fourier transforms, we know that the Fourier transform of \\( u_t + a u_x \\) is \\( -i\\xi \\hat{u}_t - i a \\xi \\hat{u} \\). Since \\( u_t + a u_x = 0 \\), it follows that \\( \\hat{u}_t = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) \\) is independent of time \\( t \\) and is equal to \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t_0) \\) for any initial time \\( t_0 \\).\n\n4. **Filtering Operation**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a filtering operation is applied to \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t_1) \\) by multiplying it with \\( e^{-b\\xi^2} \\). This results in a new Fourier transform \\( \\tilde{\\hat{u}}(\\xi, t_1) = \\hat{u}(\\xi, t_1) e^{-b\\xi^2} \\).\n\n5. **Behavior for \\( T > t_1 \\)**: Since \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t) \\) is independent of time, the filtered Fourier transform \\( \\tilde{\\hat{u}}(\\xi, t) \\) remains \\( \\tilde{\\hat{u}}(\\xi, t_1) e^{-b\\xi^2} \\) for all \\( t \\geq t_1 \\). Thus, \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is still \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, t_1) e^{-b\\xi^2} \\), which is independent of the original constant \\( a \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the behavior of \\( \\hat{u}(\\xi, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is indeed independent of \\( a \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
