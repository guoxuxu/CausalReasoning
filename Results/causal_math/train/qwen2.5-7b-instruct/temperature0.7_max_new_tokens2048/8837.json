    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Given Differential Equation**: The function \\( z(t) \\) satisfies the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\n   \\]\n   This is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation. Its general solution can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0) e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Integral Transformation \\( T[z](t) \\)**: The transformation is defined as:\n   \\[\n   T[z](t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds\n   \\]\n   Applying this transformation at \\( t = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   T[z](0) = \\int_{0}^{0} e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds = 0\n   \\]\n   So, \\( T[z](0) = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Evolution from \\( T[z](0) \\) to \\( z(T) \\)**: We need to evolve \\( T[z](0) = 0 \\) under the same differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\n   \\]\n   Since \\( T[z](0) = 0 \\), the solution starting from 0 is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t\n   \\]\n\n4. **Comparison**: Now, let's compare this with the original solution \\( z(t) \\) starting from \\( z(0) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0) e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   At \\( t = T \\), the original solution is:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z(0) e^{i\\omega T}\n   \\]\n   However, the solution evolving from \\( T[z](0) = 0 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Clearly, \\( z(T) \\) will deviate from the trajectory of a solution directly evolved from \\( z(0) \\) if \\( z(0) \\neq 0 \\).
