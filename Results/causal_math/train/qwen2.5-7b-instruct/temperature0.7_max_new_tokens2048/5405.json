    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The initial temperature distribution on the rod is \\( u(0, x) = f(x) \\).\n\n2. **Heat Evolution Model**: The heat evolution is given by the transformation \\( g(t, x) = e^{-kt} \\). This suggests that the temperature distribution at any time \\( t \\) is influenced by this cooling factor.\n\n3. **Modified Initial Condition**: If the initial heat distribution is modified by some transformation (let's call it \\( h(x) \\)), the new initial condition becomes \\( u(0, x) = f(x) + h(x) \\).\n\n4. **Heat Equation with Cooling**: Considering the heat equation with the cooling term, the solution for the temperature distribution \\( u(t, x) \\) would involve solving the partial differential equation (PDE) with the new initial condition. The solution will take into account both the initial distribution and the cooling effect.\n\n5. **Effect of Cooling**: The cooling effect \\( g(t, x) = e^{-kt} \\) means that over time, the temperature distribution will decay exponentially.
