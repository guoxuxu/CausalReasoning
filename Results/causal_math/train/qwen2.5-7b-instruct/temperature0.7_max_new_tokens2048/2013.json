The Fourier transform fundamentally changes the nature of the system's evolution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To address this question, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation with Fourier Transform**:\n   - Apply the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to \\(y(x)\\). Let \\(Y(k)\\) denote the Fourier transform of \\(y(x)\\).\n   \n2. **Transformed Differential Equation**:\n   - The original integro-differential equation is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + p(x) \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(x, t) y(t) dt\n     \\]\n   - Applying the Fourier transform to both sides of this equation involves transforming each term. The Fourier transform of \\(\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2}\\) is \\(-k^2 Y(k)\\), the Fourier transform of \\(p(x) \\frac{dy}{dx}\\) is more complex but can be handled using properties of the Fourier transform, and the Fourier transform of the integral term \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(x, t) y(t) dt\\) is \\(G(k, k) Y(k)\\), where \\(G(k, k)\\) is the Fourier transform of \\(g(x, t)\\).\n\n3. **Evolution of Transformed System**:\n   - After applying the Fourier transform, we have a new differential equation in terms of \\(Y(k)\\). This new equation will evolve over time according to the transformed initial conditions and the transformed system parameters.\n   \n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:\n   - To find the solution in the original domain, we would need to apply the inverse Fourier transform to \\(Y(k)\\) to obtain \\(y(x, t)\\).\n\n5. **Comparison with Untransformed System**:\n   - If the system evolves without any Fourier transformation (i.e., starting with \\(y(x)\\) directly and evolving according to the original equation), the solution will be different from the one obtained by first transforming, evolving, and then transforming back. This is because the Fourier transform changes the form of the equation and the nature of the evolution.\n\nGiven these points, the transformed system at \\(X\\) after time \\(t\\) will not be the same as if \\(y(x)\\) evolved without applying \\(\\mathcal{F}\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
