    "To determine if the exact nature of interventions like \\( g(X) \\) or \\( h(X) \\) can be determined solely by examining \\( X(T) \\) at the endpoint, let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE):**\n   The SDE is given as:\n   \\[\n   dX_t = AX_t dt + BX_t dW_t\n   \\]\n   This describes a system driven by both deterministic forces (via matrix \\( A \\)) and stochastic forces (via matrix \\( B \\) and Brownian motion \\( W_t \\)).\n\n2. **Transformation Applied:**\n   The transformation applied to the system is:\n   \\[\n   g(X) = C e^{Dt}X_t\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( C \\) and \\( D \\) are constant matrices.
