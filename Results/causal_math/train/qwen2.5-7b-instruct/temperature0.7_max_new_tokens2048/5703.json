The presence of \\( \\omega' \\) in the exponential term means that the transform now includes the effect of the new angular frequency \\( \\omega' \\) for times \\( t > t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}u(t) \\) where \\( \\omega \\) is the angular frequency and \\( u(t) \\) is an initially real-valued function.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} u(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s - i\\omega)t} u(t) dt\n   \\]\n   This can be simplified using the known Laplace transform property for exponentials and convolutions.\n\n3. **Intervention**: At time \\( t_1 > 0 \\), the angular frequency \\( \\omega \\) is modified to \\( \\omega' \\). This means the function changes to \\( z'(t) = e^{i\\omega' t} u(t) \\).\n\n4. **New Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of the new function \\( z'(t) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   Z'(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{i\\omega' t} u(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s - i\\omega')t} u(t) dt\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison**: The key point here is whether the change in \\( \\omega \\) to \\( \\omega' \\) at \\( t_1 > 0 \\) affects the Laplace transform \\( Z'(s) \\) only through the change in \\( \\omega \\) and not through any effects on \\( u(t) \\).\n\n6. **Causal Reasoning**: Since the Laplace transform integrates over all time starting from \\( 0 \\) to \\( \\infty \\), any modification to \\( \\omega \\) at \\( t_1 > 0 \\) will affect the entire integral, not just the part after \\( t_1 \\). Therefore, the change in \\( \\omega \\) will be reflected in the transform \\( Z'(s) \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer is that the new transform \\( Z'(s) \\) will indeed show effects from the new \\( \\omega' \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
