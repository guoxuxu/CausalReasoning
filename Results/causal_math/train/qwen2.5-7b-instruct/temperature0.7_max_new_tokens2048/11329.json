    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original System**: The output \\( z(t) \\) is given by the integral transformation \\( z(t) = (K * x)(t) \\). This means:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K(\\tau) x(t - \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n\n2. **Modified Kernel**: The new kernel is \\( K'(t) = e^{At} K(t) \\).
