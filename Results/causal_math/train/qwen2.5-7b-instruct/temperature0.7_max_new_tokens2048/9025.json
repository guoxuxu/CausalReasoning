    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\) is given, which is an entire function (analytic everywhere in the complex plane).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The integral transformation \\( g(z) = \\int_0^z f(u) du \\) is defined. This integral is known as a contour integral when \\( z \\) is allowed to vary over a path in the complex plane.\n\n3. **Path Dependence of Contour Integrals**: For functions that are not analytic (holomorphic), the value of the integral can depend on the path taken from the starting point to the endpoint.

This is because the complex exponential function \\( e^{iz} \\) is not an entire function (it has singularities in the complex plane when considering multi-valued functions), and thus the integral can be path-dependent.\n\n5. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**: However, if \\( f(z) \\) were analytic (holomorphic) over the entire domain of interest, Cauchy's integral theorem would imply that the integral is path-independent. But since \\( e^{iz} \\) is periodic and can be considered multi-valued in the complex plane, the integral can indeed be path-dependent.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that \\( e^{iz} \\) is a periodic function and considering the potential for multi-valuedness in the complex plane, the change in \\( g(z) \\) as \\( z \\) evolves will not necessarily solely correspond to the integral of \\( f(z) \\) along that path due to possible path dependence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
