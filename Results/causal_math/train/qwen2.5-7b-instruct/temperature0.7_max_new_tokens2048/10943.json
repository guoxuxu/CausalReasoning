    "Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Transformation**:\n   - We start with \\( f(z) = e^z \\).\n   - Applying the Fourier transform to \\( f(z) \\), we get \\( g(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{zt} e^{-t^2/2} dt \\).\n\n2. **Filtering in Frequency Domain**:\n   - A filtering operation in the frequency domain is represented by multiplying \\( g(w) \\) by a function \\( h(w) \\). So, \\( g'(w) = g(w) \\cdot h(w) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:\n   - To recover the signal in the time domain after filtering, we apply the inverse Fourier transform to \\( g'(w) \\), which gives us \\( f''(z) \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Filtering**:\n   - The filtering operation changes the function in the frequency domain, which translates to a change in the time domain when the inverse Fourier transform is applied.\n   - Therefore, the resultant time domain function \\( f''(z) \\) will not remain unchanged from \\( f(z) \\) unless \\( h(w) \\) is the identity function (i.e., \\( h(w) = 1 \\) for all \\( w \\)).\n\nGiven that the filtering operation modifies the function in the frequency domain, it will result in a different function in the time domain unless no filtering is applied.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Transformation**:\n   - We start with \\( f(z) = e^z \\).\n   - Applying the Fourier transform, we get \\( g(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{zw} e^{-z^2 / 2} dz \\).\n\n2. **Filtering in the Frequency Domain**:\n   - A filtering operation is performed by multiplying \\( g(w) \\) with \\( h(w) \\), resulting in \\( g'(w) = g(w) \\cdot h(w) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Fourier Transform**:\n   - The inverse Fourier transform of \\( g'(w) \\) is applied to get \\( f''(z) \\).\n\nThe key question is whether \\( f''(z) \\) will be the same as \\( f(z) \\) after these operations.\n\n4. **Effect of Filtering**:\n   - Multiplying by \\( h(w) \\) in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution in the time domain.\n   - Convolution is a linear operation that generally changes the original signal unless \\( h(w) \\) is a very specific function (e.g., delta function for identity operation).\n\n5. **Recovery in Time Domain**:\n   - If \\( h(w) \\) is not a constant function (which would correspond to no change in the time domain), then the convolution will alter \\( f(z) \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( f''(z) \\) will not be identical to \\( f(z) \\) unless \\( h(w) \\) is a constant function.\n\nGiven the general case where \\( h(w) \\) is not a constant function, the resultant function \\( f''(z) \\) will be different from \\( f(z) \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
