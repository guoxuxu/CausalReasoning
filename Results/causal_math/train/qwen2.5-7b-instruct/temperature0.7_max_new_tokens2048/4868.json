The Fourier transform would show a phase shift corresponding to \\( \\phi \\), but without additional information, we cannot distinguish between different angles \\( \\theta \\) and \\( \\phi \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the Fourier transform output alone, there is no unique way to determine the specific rotation angles \\( \\theta \\) or \\( \\phi \\) that were applied.
