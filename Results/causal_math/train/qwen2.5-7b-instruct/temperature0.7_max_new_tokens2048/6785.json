  "Explanation": "Applying \\\\( h(z) \\\\) modifies the initial condition to \\\\( e^{aT}z_0 \\\\), and this transformation shifts the magnitude of the initial vector. The modified trajectory will thus differ due to the additional exponential scaling factor, altering both the magnitude and potentially the phase of the outcome at time T.",
