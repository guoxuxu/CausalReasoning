    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with an analytic function \\( f(z) \\).\n\n2. **Transformation 1**: The function \\( f(z) \\) is multiplied by \\( e^z \\). This results in a new function \\( h(z) = f(z) e^z \\).\n\n3. **Transformation 2**: The Fourier Transform \\( F \\) is applied to \\( h(z) \\).

Specifically, if \\( h(z) = f(z) e^z \\), then the Fourier Transform of \\( h(z) \\) will have a specific form that reflects this multiplication by \\( e^z \\).\n\n- **Uniqueness**: Given the Fourier Transform of \\( h(z) \\), it is possible to deduce the form of \\( h(z) \\) up to a certain extent. If the Fourier Transform shows a pattern that is characteristic of a function multiplied by \\( e^z \\), then we can infer that \\( e^z \\) was indeed the initial multiplier.\n\nHowever, without additional information about \\( g(z) \\) and its effects, we cannot definitively say that \\( e^z \\) was the only possible initial function. There might be other functions that, when multiplied by \\( f(z) \\) and then transformed, could produce a similar Fourier Transform result.\n\nSince the problem does not provide enough information to conclusively determine that \\( e^z \\) was the only possible initial function, we cannot definitively deduce the initial transformation.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
