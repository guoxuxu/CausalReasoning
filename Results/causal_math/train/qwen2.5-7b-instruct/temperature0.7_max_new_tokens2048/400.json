  "Explanation": "The end function \\\\( v(x) \\\\) at x = 1 could possibly result from different combinations of transformations and the behavior under the differential operator. The overlapping effects from the exponential transformations applied to the function at different points add ambiguities that prevent the pinpointing of specific interventions or their sequence.",
