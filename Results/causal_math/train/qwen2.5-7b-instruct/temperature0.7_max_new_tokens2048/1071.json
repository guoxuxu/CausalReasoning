    "To determine if the state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is independent of the initial \\( B \\) after the intervention at time \\( t_1 \\), let's analyze the given system step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the System Dynamics\nThe system is described by the differential equation:\n\\[ \\dot{z} = Az + B \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\)\n- \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are complex constants\n- \\( \\dot{z} \\) represents the derivative of \\( z \\) with respect to time \\( t \\)\n\n### Step 2: Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)\nAt time \\( t_1 \\), the constant \\( B \\) is replaced with a new constant \\( B' \\). This means that for \\( t < t_1 \\), the system follows:\n\\[ \\dot{z}(t) = Az(t) + B \\]\nAnd for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the system follows:\n\\[ \\dot{z}(t) = Az(t) + B' \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Differential Equation\nWe need to solve the differential equation for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\).\n\nFor \\( t \\geq t_1 \\):\n\\[ \\dot{z}(t) = Az(t) + B' \\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. The general solution can be written as:\n\\[ z(t) = e^{A(t-t_1)}z(t_1) + \\frac{B'}{A} (e^{A(t-t_1)} - 1) \\]\n\nHere:\n- \\( z(t_1) \\) is the state of the system at time \\( t_1 \\)\n- \\( e^{A(t-t_1)} \\) is the state transition matrix\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the State at Time \\( T \\)\nFor \\( T > t_1 \\), the state \\( z(T) \\) is:\n\\[ z(T) = e^{A(T-t_1)}z(t_1) + \\frac{B'}{A} (e^{A(T-t_1)} - 1) \\]\n\nNotice that the term \\( e^{A(T-t_1)}z(t_1) \\) depends on the initial state \\( z(t_1) \\) which itself depends on the initial condition before \\( t_1 \\) and the original \\( B \\). However, the term \\( \\frac{B'}{A} (e^{A(T-t_1)} - 1) \\) depends directly on \\( B' \\) and not on the initial \\( B \\).\n\n### Step 5: Independence Analysis\nThe state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) can be split into two parts:\n1. A part that depends on the initial state \\( z(t_1) \\), which includes the influence of the initial \\( B \\).\n2. A part that depends only on \\( B' \\).\n\nThus, while the initial state \\( z(t_1) \\) does depend on the initial \\( B \\), the term involving \\( B' \\) shows that the state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is also influenced by \\( B' \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is not independent of the initial \\( B \\) because the initial state \\( z(t_1) \\) still carries the influence of the initial \\( B \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
