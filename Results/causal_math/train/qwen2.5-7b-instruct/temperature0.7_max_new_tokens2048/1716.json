    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function \\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\) represents a complex number that rotates around the origin in the complex plane with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\). Here, \\( C \\) is a complex constant that determines the initial position and amplitude of the rotation.\n\n2. **Phase Shifts**: A phase shift can be introduced by multiplying the function by another complex exponential term. If there's a phase shift \\( \\phi \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), it would modify the function to \\( z(t) = Ce^{i(\\omega t + \\phi)} \\). Similarly, if there's an additional phase shift \\( \\theta \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\), it would further modify the function to \\( z(t) = Ce^{i(\\omega t + \\phi + \\theta)} \\).\n\n3. **Observing \\( z'(T) \\)**: We are given \\( z'(T) \\), which means we know the value of the function at some time \\( T \\). This gives us:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = Ce^{i(\\omega T + \\phi + \\theta)}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Determine Phase Shifts**:\n   - The phase shift \\( \\phi \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) can be directly determined from the initial value of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     z(0) = Ce^{i\\phi}\n     \\]\n     Since \\( z(0) \\) is known, we can solve for \\( \\phi \\).\n   - For the phase shift \\( \\theta \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\), we need to consider the change from \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = t_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     z(t_1) = Ce^{i(\\omega t_1 + \\phi + \\theta)}\n     \\]\n     Knowing \\( z(t_1) \\) and having already determined \\( \\phi \\), we can solve for \\( \\theta \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given \\( z'(T) \\) (which is essentially \\( z(T) \\)) and knowing the original frequency \\( \\omega \\), we can indeed uniquely determine both phase shifts \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\theta \\) because these phase shifts are directly observable from the changes in the function over time.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

If only \\( z'(T) \\) (which gives us \\( z(T) \\)) is provided, it is not sufficient to determine both phase shifts \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\theta \\) because \\( z(0) \\) and \\( z(t_1) \\) are required to fix the initial and intermediate phases.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot uniquely determine the phase shifts \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\theta \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To address this question, let's break down the given information and the steps required to determine if we can uniquely determine the phase shifts \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\theta \\).\n\n1. **Given Function**: The function is \\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\). Here, \\( C \\) is a constant complex number, and \\( \\omega \\) is the angular frequency.\n\n2. **Observations**:\n   - We observe \\( z'(T) \\).\n   - We know the original frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Objective**: Determine if we can uniquely determine the phase shifts \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\theta \\) applied at \\( t = 0 \\) and \\( t_1 \\) respectively.\n\n4. **Causal Relationships**:\n   - \\( z'(T) \\rightarrow \\omega \\): This implies we have the derivative of \\( z \\) at time \\( T \\) and the known frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n   - \\( \\omega \\rightarrow z(T) \\): With the frequency \\( \\omega \\) and the observation \\( z'(T) \\), we can calculate \\( z(T) \\).\n   - \\( z(0) \\rightarrow \\phi \\): At \\( t = 0 \\), the function is \\( z(0) = Ce^{i\\phi} \\), so we can determine the initial phase shift \\( \\phi \\) from \\( z(0) \\).\n   - \\( z(t_1) \\rightarrow \\theta \\): At \\( t = t_1 \\), the function is \\( z(t_1) = Ce^{i(\\omega t_1 + \\theta)} \\), so we can determine the phase shift \\( \\theta \\) from \\( z(t_1) \\).\n   - \\( \\phi \\rightarrow z(t_1) \\): Knowing \\( \\phi \\), we can predict the value of \\( z(t_1) \\).\n   - \\( \\theta \\rightarrow z(T) \\): Knowing \\( \\theta \\), we can predict the value of \\( z(T) \\).\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - From \\( z'(T) \\) and \\( \\omega \\), we can find \\( z(T) \\).\n   - Knowing \\( z(0) \\), we can directly determine \\( \\phi \\).\n   - Knowing \\( z(t_1) \\), we can determine \\( \\theta \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - We have enough information to determine both \\( \\phi \\) and \\( \\theta \\) uniquely based on the given observations and the known frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
