After \\( t_1 \\), the state evolves according to \\( x'(t) = Nx(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\). The transformation \\( M \\) acts on the state vector at \\( t_1 \\), i.e., \\( x(t_1) \\to Mx(t_1) \\).\n\n4. **Final State at \\( T \\)**: To determine if the final state \\( x(T) \\) depends solely on \\( D \\) and not on \\( M \\) or \\( N \\):\n\n   - From \\( t = 0 \\) to \\( t = t_1 \\), the state evolves according to \\( x'(t) = Dx(t) \\).\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), the state is transformed by \\( M \\) to \\( Mx(t_1) \\).\n   - From \\( t = t_1 \\) to \\( t = T \\), the state evolves according to \\( x'(t) = Nx(t) \\).\n\nThe key point here is that the transformation \\( M \\) only affects the state at \\( t_1 \\) and does not influence the subsequent evolution governed by \\( N \\). The evolution from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\) is solely dependent on \\( N \\), not on \\( M \\).\n\nTherefore, the final state \\( x(T) \\) will be influenced by both \\( D \\) (through the initial evolution) and \\( N \\) (through the intervention and subsequent evolution), but not directly by \\( M \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the final state \\( x(T) \\) does not depend solely on \\( D \\) but also on \\( N \\) due to the intervention at \\( t_1 \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
