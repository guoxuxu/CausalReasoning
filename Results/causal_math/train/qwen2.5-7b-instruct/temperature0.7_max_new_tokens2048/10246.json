This function is transformed by multiplying it by \\( e^{at} \\), resulting in \\( g(t) = e^{at} t^2 \\).\n3. The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} g(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{at} t^2 \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-a)t} t^2 \\, dt\n   \\]\n4. To find \\( G(s) \\), we recognize that this integral is the Laplace transform of \\( t^2 \\) with a shifted parameter \\( s - a \\):\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\frac{2!}{(s-a)^3} = \\frac{2}{(s-a)^3}\n   \\]\n5. Now, if we only know \\( G(s) \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\frac{2}{(s-a)^3}\n   \\]\n6. The form of \\( G(s) \\) does not uniquely determine \\( a \\), but it does tell us that the original function must be of the form \\( t^2 \\) after accounting for the shift.\n7. Since the Laplace transform of \\( t^2 \\) is known to be \\( \\frac{2}{s^3} \\), the presence of \\( (s-a)^3 \\) indicates that the original function was \\( t^2 \\) before the exponential multiplication.\n\nGiven these steps, even though we don't know \\( a \\) explicitly, the form of \\( G(s) \\) uniquely points back to \\( t^2 \\) as the original function.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the function \\( f(t) = t^2 \\).\n2. We apply the transformation \\( e^{at} \\) to \\( f(t) \\), resulting in \\( g(t) = e^{at} t^2 \\).\n3. The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{at} t^2 \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-a)t} t^2 \\, dt\n   \\]\n4. This integral is a standard form for the Laplace transform of \\( t^2 \\) shifted by \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\frac{2!}{(s-a)^3} = \\frac{2}{(s-a)^3}\n   \\]\n5. Now, if we only know \\( G(s) \\) and not the specific form of \\( g(t) \\), we cannot uniquely determine that \\( g(t) = e^{at} t^2 \\) was the original transformation.\n6. The Laplace transform \\( G(s) = \\frac{2}{(s-a)^3} \\) could result from other functions that have been transformed in a similar way (i.e., multiplied by \\( e^{at} \\)).\n\nGiven this reasoning, we conclude that knowing only the Laplace transform \\( G(s) \\) does not allow us to uniquely identify the original function \\( f(t) \\) as \\( t^2 \\) without additional information about the transformation.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
