    "To determine whether we can exactly trace back from \\( z(T) \\) to know both the original function \\( g(s) \\) and the intervention \\( k(s) \\) applied at \\( t_0 \\), let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understand the Transformation**: The function \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(t, s) g(s) ds\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( F(t, s) \\) is a kernel function and \\( g(s) \\) is the initial function. The transformation involves integrating the product of the kernel function and the initial function over all \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Intervention**: If an intervention \\( k(s) \\) is applied at \\( t_0 \\), the new function becomes \\( g(s) + k(s) \\). Therefore, the transformed function \\( z(t) \\) now includes this intervention:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(t, s) (g(s) + k(s)) ds = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(t, s) g(s) ds + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(t, s) k(s) ds\n   \\]\n\n3. **Impact on \\( z(T) \\)**: At time \\( T \\), the value of \\( z(T) \\) will be:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(T, s) g(s) ds + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F(T, s) k(s) ds\n   \\]\n\n4. **Invertibility**: To uniquely determine both \\( g(s) \\) and \\( k(s) \\) from \\( z(T) \\), we need to consider if the system is invertible. In general, without additional information about the form of \\( F(t, s) \\) and the specific nature of \\( g(s) \\) and \\( k(s) \\), it is not straightforward to separate these contributions. The convolution structure of the integral suggests that the effect of \\( g(s) \\) and \\( k(s) \\) is mixed, making it difficult to isolate one from the other solely based on \\( z(T) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the complexity and the convolution nature of the transformation, it is generally not possible to exactly trace back from \\( z(T) \\) to uniquely determine both \\( g(s) \\) and \\( k(s) \\) without additional constraints or information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
