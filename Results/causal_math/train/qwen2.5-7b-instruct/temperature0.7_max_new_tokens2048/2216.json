If \\( A \\neq -B \\), then \\( A+B \\neq 0 \\), and the value of \\( g(z) \\) is unique.\n   - However, if \\( A = -B \\), then \\( A+B = 0 \\), and the integral becomes undefined (or zero if interpreted as a limit). In this case, \\( g(z) = 0 \\) regardless of the value of \\( v \\), which means multiple functions could potentially map to \\( g(z) = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that \\( g(z) \\) is uniquely determined by \\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\) when \\( A \\neq -B \\), but not necessarily when \\( A = -B \\), we cannot conclusively determine whether the function applied was \\( e^{At}v \\) without additional information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the function applied was \\( e^{At}v \\) based on the transformation result \\( g(z) \\), we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Given Function and Transformation:**\n   - The function is \\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\).\n   - The transformation is \\( g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}z(t)\\, dt \\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\( z(t) \\) into \\( g(z) \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\) into the transformation:\n     \\[\n     g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{Bt}e^{At}v\\, dt.\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the integrand using the property of exponents \\( e^{Bt}e^{At} = e^{(A+B)t} \\):\n     \\[\n     g(z) = \\int_0^T e^{(A+B)t}v\\, dt.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the Integral:**\n   - Since \\( v \\) is a constant vector, it can be factored out of the integral:\n     \\[\n     g(z) = v \\int_0^T e^{(A+B)t}\\, dt.\n     \\]\n   - Evaluate the integral:\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^T e^{(A+B)t}\\, dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(A+B)t}}{A+B} \\right]_0^T = \\frac{e^{(A+B)T} - 1}{A+B}.\n     \\]\n   - Therefore,\n     \\[\n     g(z) = v \\cdot \\frac{e^{(A+B)T} - 1}{A+B}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine Uniqueness:**\n   - The expression for \\( g(z) \\) depends on the matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) and the time interval \\( T \\). If \\( A \\neq -B \\), then \\( g(z) \\) uniquely determines \\( e^{At}v \\) because the form of the expression is specific to the function \\( e^{At}v \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given \\( g(z) \\), \\( B \\), and \\( T \\), one can determine the form of \\( e^{At}v \\) uniquely as long as \\( A \\neq -B \\). If \\( A = -B \\), the integral simplifies to \\( \\int_0^T e^{0t}v\\, dt = Tv \\), which does not provide enough information to distinguish between different functions unless additional constraints are provided.\n\nSince the problem statement does not specify any conditions that would make \\( A = -B \\), we assume \\( A \\neq -B \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
