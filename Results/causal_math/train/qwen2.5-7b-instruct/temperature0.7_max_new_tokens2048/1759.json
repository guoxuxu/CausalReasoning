    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation Analysis**: The given differential equation is \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = i \\omega z \\). This is a first-order linear differential equation with the solution \\( z(t) = A e^{i \\omega t} \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the function \\( z(t) \\) is transformed into \\( f(z) = z^2 \\). Therefore, after the transformation, the function becomes \\( z^2(t) = (A e^{i \\omega t})^2 = A^2 e^{2i \\omega t} \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} A e^{i \\omega t} e^{-st} dt = A \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(i \\omega - s)t} dt = \\frac{A}{s - i \\omega}\n   \\]\n   Similarly, the Laplace transform of \\( z^2(t) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   Z^2(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z^2(t) e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} A^2 e^{2i \\omega t} e^{-st} dt = A^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(2i \\omega - s)t} dt = \\frac{A^2}{s - 2i \\omega}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Effect of Intervention**: The intervention \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) changes the form of \\( z(t) \\) but does not change the underlying relationship between \\( z(t) \\) and \\( \\omega \\). The Laplace transform of the transformed function \\( z^2(t) \\) still depends on \\( \\omega \\) because the exponent in the integrand is directly related to \\( \\omega \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The transformed Laplace transform \\( \\tilde{z}(s) \\) will indeed depend on \\( i \\omega \\) due to the form of the exponent in the integrand. The nature of the intervention (squaring the function) modifies the exponent but does not eliminate the dependence on \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
