    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\).

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\). Here, \\( e^{At} \\) and \\( e^{Bt} \\) are matrix exponentials which represent the evolution of the systems over time.\n\n2. **Modification at \\( t = 0 \\)**: At \\( t = 0 \\), the vector \\( y \\) is modified to \\( y' \\). So, for \\( t < 0 \\), the function remains as \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\).

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: The initial condition for \\( z(t) \\) is \\( z(0) = e^{A \\cdot 0}x + e^{B \\cdot 0}y = x + y \\).\n\n2. **Modification at \\( t = 0 \\)**: If we modify \\( y \\) to \\( y' \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), the new initial condition becomes \\( z(0) = x + y' \\).\n\n3. **Evolution Over Time**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\) describes how the system evolves over time.
