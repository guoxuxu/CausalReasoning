    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**:\n   - The function \\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\) maps a complex number \\( z \\) to another complex number using a matrix \\( B \\).\n   - The function \\( f(x) = Ax \\) is a linear transformation that maps a vector \\( x \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\) to another vector in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\).\n\n2. **Given Information**:\n   - We know the state of the system at \\( z = T \\) after both transformations.\n   - The transformations are applied sequentially: first \\( g(z) \\) and then \\( f(x) \\).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Problem**:\n   - To find the original vector \\( x_0 \\), we need to reverse these transformations.\n   - First, we need to reverse the effect of \\( f(x) \\) by applying the inverse of \\( A \\), assuming \\( A \\) is invertible.\n   - Then, we need to reverse the effect of \\( g(z) \\).\n\n4. **Reversing the Transformations**:\n   - Reversing \\( f(x) = Ax \\) gives us \\( x = A^{-1}y \\), where \\( y \\) is the state of the system at \\( z = T \\).\n   - Reversing \\( g(z) = e^{iBz} \\) involves finding the argument (angle) of the complex number \\( y \\) and solving for \\( z \\).
