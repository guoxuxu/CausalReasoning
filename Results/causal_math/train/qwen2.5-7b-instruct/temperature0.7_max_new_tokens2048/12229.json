    "To address this question, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform \\( S[f(t)] = F(s) \\) is defined as \\( F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}f(t) dt \\). This transforms a time-domain function \\( f(t) \\) into a frequency-domain function \\( F(s) \\).\n\n2. **Given Differential Equation**: The differential equation provided is \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} + ax = b \\), which describes a linear system with constant coefficients.
