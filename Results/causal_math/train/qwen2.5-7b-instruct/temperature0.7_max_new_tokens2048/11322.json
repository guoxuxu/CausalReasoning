This transformation is applied globally within the region \\(\\Omega\\).\n\n3. **Influence on the Laplace Equation**: Since the Laplace equation is linear, applying the transformation \\(f(u) = u + g(x)\\) does not change the fact that the transformed function \\(f(u)\\) still satisfies the Laplace equation if \\(u\\) did.
