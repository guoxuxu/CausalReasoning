This means the new initial condition for the heat equation becomes \\( u(x, 0) + h(x) \\).\n\n2. **Heat Equation Evolution**: The heat equation is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n   \\]\n   When we apply this equation to the transformed initial condition \\( u(x, 0) + h(x) \\), the solution will evolve according to the heat equation.
