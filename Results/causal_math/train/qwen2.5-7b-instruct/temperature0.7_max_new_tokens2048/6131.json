However, the intervention \\(S_d(z)\\) at \\(t_1\\) introduces \\(d\\) into the system. Since the differential equation is continuous and the intervention only affects the system after \\(t_1\\), the influence of \\(d\\) on \\(z(T)\\) (for \\(T > t_1\\)) is significant because it alters the subsequent behavior of \\(z(t)\\) starting from \\(t_1\\).\n\nThe cumulative effect of \\(c\\) up to \\(t_1\\) is captured in \\(T_c(z)\\), but the effect of \\(d\\) starting from \\(t_1\\) will be reflected in the subsequent evolution of \\(z(t)\\). Therefore, the final state \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will indeed depend on both \\(c\\) and \\(d\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
