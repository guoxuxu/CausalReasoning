    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Functions and Composition**:\n   - \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\)\n   - \\( g(z) = z^2 \\)\n   - The composition \\( h(z) = g(f(z)) = (f(z))^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{z^2} \\)\n\n2. **Integral Consideration**:\n   - We are considering the integral \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) where \\( C \\) is a contour in the complex plane.\n   - For \\( C \\) being a circular path around the origin, the integral \\( \\int_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz \\) is well-known to be \\( 2\\pi i \\) due to the residue theorem, since \\( \\frac{1}{z} \\) has a simple pole at \\( z = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Impact of Changing the Contour**:\n   - When changing the contour \\( C \\) from a circular path to a rectangular path, the integral \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) can change due to the different path taken, especially because \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) has a singularity at \\( z = 0 \\).\n   - However, the key point here is whether the integral depends solely on \\( f(z) \\) regardless of the shape of the contour.\n\n4. **Dependence on \\( f(z) \\)**:\n   - The integral \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) is fundamentally dependent on the behavior of \\( f(z) \\) along the path \\( C \\).\n   - Changing the contour from a circle to a rectangle might change the value of the integral, but it does not change the fact that the integral is defined based on the properties of \\( f(z) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the exact value of the integral may change with the contour, the dependency on \\( f(z) \\) remains unchanged. The integral is always defined in terms of \\( f(z) \\) and the path \\( C \\).\n\nTherefore, the result of \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) is still representative of a function solely dependent on the original function \\( f(z) \\), even when the contour \\( C \\) is altered.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

    "To determine whether the result of \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) remains solely dependent on the original function \\( f(z) \\) when the contour \\( C \\) changes from a circular path around the origin to a rectangular path, we need to analyze the properties of the integrals over different contours.\n\n1. **Understanding \\( f(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\):**\n   - \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\)\n   - \\( g(z) = z^2 \\)\n   - \\( h(z) = g(f(z)) = (f(z))^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{z^2} \\)\n\n2. **Integral Analysis:**\n   - The function \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) has a singularity at \\( z = 0 \\).\n   - For a closed contour \\( C \\) that encircles the origin, Cauchy's Integral Formula or the Residue Theorem tells us that:\n     \\[\n     \\int_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz = 2\\pi i\n     \\]\n   - However, for other contours, the value of the integral can vary depending on the path taken.\n\n3. **Change in Contour:**\n   - When the contour changes from a circular path around the origin to a rectangular path, the nature of the path affects the integral.\n   - A rectangular path may not enclose the origin, in which case the integral would be zero if there are no singularities inside the contour.\n   - If the rectangular path does enclose the origin, the integral will still depend on the residue at \\( z = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Dependence on Original Function \\( f(z) \\):**\n   - The integral \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) depends on the specific path \\( C \\).\n   - Changing \\( C \\) from a circle to a rectangle alters the value of the integral, even though the original function \\( f(z) \\) remains the same.\n\nGiven these points, the result of \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\) is not solely dependent on the original function \\( f(z) \\) because it also depends on the path \\( C \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
