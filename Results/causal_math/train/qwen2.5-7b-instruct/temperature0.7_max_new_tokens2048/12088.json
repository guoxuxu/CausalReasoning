    "To determine if the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s)\\) remains unaffected when \\(A\\) is modified to \\(A + \\Delta A\\), we need to analyze how the Laplace transform changes with the modification of \\(A\\).\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\(h(x) = e^{Ax}\\).\n2. **Laplace Transform of Original Function**: The Laplace transform of \\(h(x)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{h(t)\\}(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{At} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(A-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges for values of \\(s\\) such that the real part of \\(s - A\\) is positive.
