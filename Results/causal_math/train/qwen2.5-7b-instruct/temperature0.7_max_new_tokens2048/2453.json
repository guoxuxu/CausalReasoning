At \\( t = T \\), this becomes \\( z'(T) = e^{PT}(Qz_0) \\).\n\n7. **Comparison**: To determine if the states are equivalent, we need to compare \\( z(T) \\) and \\( z'(T) \\):\n   - Direct evolution: \\( z(T) = e^{PT}z_0 \\)\n   - Transformed evolution: \\( z'(T) = e^{PT}(Qz_0) \\)\n\nFor these two states to be equivalent, \\( Qz_0 \\) must equal \\( z_0 \\).
