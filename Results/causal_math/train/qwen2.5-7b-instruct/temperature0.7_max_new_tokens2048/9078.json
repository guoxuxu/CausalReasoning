This operation typically represents a linear time-invariant (LTI) system's effect on the input signal in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Recovering \\( F(s) \\)**: To recover \\( F(s) \\) from \\( H(s)F(s) \\), we need to isolate \\( F(s) \\). This would require dividing both sides by \\( H(s) \\), i.e., \\( F(s) = \\frac{H(s)F(s)}{H(s)} \\).\n\n4. **Conditions for Recovery**: For this division to be valid, \\( H(s) \\) must not have any zeros at the same points as \\( F(s) \\) (to avoid division by zero) and should not be identically zero in the region of interest.
