    "To determine if the transformed result \\( F(z) \\) remains unchanged when the path \\( C \\) is slightly varied without crossing or touching the singular point \\( a \\), let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Original Integral Definition**: The original integral is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{C} \\frac{e^{zt}}{(z-a)^2} dz\n   \\]\n   where \\( C \\) is a contour that encircles the singularity at \\( z = a \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Path Perturbation**: When we slightly vary the path \\( C \\) without crossing or touching the singularity at \\( z = a \\), we are essentially deforming the contour within a region that does not include the singularity. This deformation should not affect the value of the integral because the integrand \\( \\frac{e^{zt}}{(z-a)^2} \\) is analytic (holomorphic) everywhere except at the singularity \\( z = a \\).\n\n3. **Cauchy's Integral Theorem**: Cauchy's Integral Theorem states that for a function that is holomorphic inside and on a simple closed curve, the integral of the function over that curve is zero. However, in this case, the function \\( \\frac{e^{zt}}{(z-a)^2} \\) has a pole of order 2 at \\( z = a \\), so the integral is related to the residue at that point.

However, in our case, the integrand has a singularity inside the contour, so the integral is not zero.\n   - The key point here is that the integral is path-dependent when there is a singularity inside the contour. But since we are only deforming the contour and not changing the nature of the singularity, the value of the integral should remain the same for small deformations.\n\n3. **Effect of Modifying the Exponential Term's Coefficient**:\n   - If we modify the exponential term's coefficient, say from \\( e^{zt} \\) to \\( e^{\\alpha zt} \\) where \\( \\alpha \\neq 1 \\), then the integrand changes to \\( \\frac{e^{\\alpha zt}}{(z-a)^2} \\).\n   - This change would generally affect the value of the integral, unless specific conditions (like \\( \\alpha = 1 \\)) are met.
