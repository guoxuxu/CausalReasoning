    "To determine if we can always uniquely determine both \\(X(f)\\) and \\(H(f)\\) from \\(Y(f)\\), let's reason through the process step by step.\n\n1. **Convolution Theorem**: According to the Convolution Theorem, the Fourier Transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their individual Fourier Transforms. Therefore:\n   \\[\n   Y(f) = X(f) \\cdot H(f)\n   \\]\n   where \\(Y(f)\\) is the Fourier Transform of \\(y(t)\\), \\(X(f)\\) is the Fourier Transform of \\(x(t)\\), and \\(H(f)\\) is the Fourier Transform of \\(h(t)\\).\n\n2. **Factorization Problem**: Given \\(Y(f) = X(f) \\cdot H(f)\\), we need to determine whether \\(X(f)\\) and \\(H(f)\\) can be uniquely recovered from \\(Y(f)\\).\n\n3. **Uniqueness Consideration**: For \\(X(f)\\) and \\(H(f)\\) to be uniquely determined, \\(Y(f)\\) must not have any loss of information that would make it impossible to separate \\(X(f)\\) and \\(H(f)\\). However, in the general case, knowing only the product \\(Y(f) = X(f) \\cdot H(f)\\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine both \\(X(f)\\) and \\(H(f)\\) without additional constraints or prior knowledge about one of them.\n\n4. **Example**: Consider two different pairs of \\(X(f)\\) and \\(H(f)\\) such that their product is the same:\n   - Let \\(X_1(f) = 1\\) and \\(H_1(f) = Y(f)\\)\n   - Let \\(X_2(f) = 2\\) and \\(H_2(f) = \\frac{Y(f)}{2}\\)\n   \n   In both cases, \\(Y(f) = X(f) \\cdot H(f)\\) holds true, but \\(X(f)\\) and \\(H(f)\\) are not unique.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without additional information or constraints, it is not possible to uniquely determine both \\(X(f)\\) and \\(H(f)\\) from \\(Y(f)\\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
