This means it changes the state of the system but does not fundamentally alter the underlying dynamics governed by \\(D\\). It merely shifts the state vector according to the matrix \\(S\\).\n\n3. **Intervention Control \\(k(x) = Mx\\)**: At a specific time \\(t_1\\), an additional control \\(k(x) = Mx\\) is introduced.
