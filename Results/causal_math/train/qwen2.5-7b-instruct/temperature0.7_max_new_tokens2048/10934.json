    "Let's break down the problem step by step to determine if we can infer the order of operations (whether \\(L\\) was applied before or after \\(T\\)) based on the given information.\n\n1. **Signal Transformation**: We have a signal \\( x(t) \\) that undergoes a transformation by a linear operator \\( L \\).
