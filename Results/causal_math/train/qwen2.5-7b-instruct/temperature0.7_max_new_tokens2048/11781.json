This means that if \\(z(t)\\) is the solution to the differential equation, then the transformed function \\(z'(t) = z(t) \\cdot e^{Rt}\\) would satisfy a different differential equation due to the chain rule.\n\n3. **Transformed Function**: If \\(z(t)\\) satisfies the original differential equation, then:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(z \\cdot e^{Rt}) = \\frac{dz}{dt} \\cdot e^{Rt} + z \\cdot Re^{Rt}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz + Q\\) into the above expression:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(z \\cdot e^{Rt}) = (Pz + Q)e^{Rt} + zRe^{Rt} = (P + R)ze^{Rt} + Qe^{Rt}\n   \\]\n   Let \\(P' = P + R\\) and \\(Q' = Q\\).
