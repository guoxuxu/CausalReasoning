    "To determine if the transformed function \\(u(h(x, y))\\) satisfies the Laplace equation after the transformation \\(h(x, y) = (e^{ax}, e^{by})\\), we need to analyze how the Laplacian operator transforms under this mapping.\n\n1. **Original Laplace Equation**: The original potential function \\(u(x, y)\\) satisfies \\(\\nabla^2 u = 0\\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation is \\(h(x, y) = (x', y') = (e^{ax}, e^{by})\\).
