The solutions are given by:\n   \\[\n   z^* = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4c}}{2}\n   \\]\n   These are the potential fixed points, assuming they exist.\n\n3. **Stability of Fixed Points**: To determine if these fixed points are attracting (i.e., if the sequence \\( z_n \\) converges to them), we need to look at the derivative of \\( f(z) \\) evaluated at the fixed points. The derivative of \\( f(z) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   f'(z) = 2z\n   \\]\n   Evaluating at the fixed points \\( z^* \\):\n   \\[\n   f'(z^*) = 2z^*\n   \\]\n   For a fixed point to be attracting, \\( |f'(z^*)| < 1 \\).\n\n4. **Behavior of Iterations**: If \\( |f'(z^*)| < 1 \\), then the fixed point is attracting, meaning that if the initial value \\( z_0 \\) is close enough to \\( z^* \\), the sequence \\( z_n \\) will converge to \\( z^* \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Whether the sequence \\( z_n \\) converges to a fixed point depends on the initial value \\( z_0 \\) and the specific value of \\( c \\). In general, for most values of \\( c \\) and \\( z_0 \\), the sequence does not necessarily converge to a fixed point but rather may exhibit more complex behavior, such as periodic cycles or chaotic behavior.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that convergence to a fixed point is not guaranteed for arbitrary \\( z_0 \\) and \\( c \\), the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
