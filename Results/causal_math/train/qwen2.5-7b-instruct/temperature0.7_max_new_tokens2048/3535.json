Here, \\(k\\) is the diffusion coefficient.\n\n2. **Fourier Transformation Impact**: Applying the Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) to the initial condition \\(u(x, 0)\\) can help solve this PDE more easily. The Fourier transform converts the spatial derivatives into multiplications in the frequency domain, simplifying the PDE to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time.
