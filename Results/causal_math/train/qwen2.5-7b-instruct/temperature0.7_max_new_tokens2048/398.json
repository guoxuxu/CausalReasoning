However, since \\( u(0) = 0 \\) is a given boundary condition, we can directly conclude that \\( u(0) = 0 \\) regardless of the transformation.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Given Information**:\n   - The linear operator \\( L \\) is defined as \\( L[u] = -\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + cu \\).\n   - Boundary conditions are \\( u(0) = u(1) = 0 \\).\n   - Transformation: \\( u(x) = v(x)e^{\\alpha x} \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Analysis**:\n   - If \\( u(x) = v(x)e^{\\alpha x} \\), then applying the transformation back gives \\( v(x) = u(x)e^{-\\alpha x} \\).\n   - This means that if we know \\( v(x) \\) at any point, we can recover \\( u(x) \\) using the inverse transformation.\n\n3. **Observation at x = 1**:\n   - We observe \\( v(1) \\). Using the inverse transformation, we can find \\( u(1) = v(1)e^{-\\alpha} \\).\n\n4. **Boundary Condition at x = 0**:\n   - We need to determine \\( u(0) \\).\n   - From the transformation, \\( u(0) = v(0)e^{0} = v(0) \\).\n   - However, we do not have information about \\( v(0) \\) directly from the given observation at \\( x = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While we can use the transformation to find \\( u(1) \\), we cannot deduce \\( u(0) \\) without additional information about \\( v(0) \\) or more details about \\( v(x) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
