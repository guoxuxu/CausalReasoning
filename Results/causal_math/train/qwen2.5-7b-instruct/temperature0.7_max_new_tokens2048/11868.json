    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation given is \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\). This describes how the temperature \\( u \\) changes over time \\( t \\) due to spatial diffusion with a rate proportional to the second spatial derivative \\( u_{xx} \\).\n\n2. **Initial Condition**: The initial condition provided is \\( f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\). This means that at time \\( t = 0 \\), the temperature distribution along the rod is given by this Gaussian function.\n\n3. **Evolution of Temperature Distribution**: When the system evolves according to the heat equation, it means that the temperature distribution \\( u(x,t) \\) changes over time based on the heat equation dynamics alone.
