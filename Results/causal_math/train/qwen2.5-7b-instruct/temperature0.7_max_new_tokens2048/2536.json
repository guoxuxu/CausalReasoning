However, if we consider the Laplace transform in a generalized sense (e.g., in the context of complex analysis or certain integral transforms that can handle complex variables), we need to ensure that the integral converges appropriately.\n\n3. **Transformed Function \\( H(s) \\)**: If we apply a generalized Laplace transform to \\( g(z) \\), we would get a function \\( H(s) \\). For simplicity, let's assume we are considering a similar form of transformation that modifies the function in a way analogous to the Laplace transform but for complex variables. \n\n4. **Impact of Real Part Change**: If we change the real part of \\( z \\), say from \\( \\text{Re}(z) \\) to \\( \\text{Re}(z') \\), the function \\( g(z) \\) will change its behavior significantly because the exponential growth/decay rate depends on the real part of \\( \\lambda z \\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Parameters**: To determine if \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) can be uniquely determined from \\( H(s) \\), we need to consider whether the information provided by \\( H(s) \\) is sufficient to reconstruct \\( g(z) \\) up to these parameters. \n\n6. **Complex Analysis Insight**: In complex analysis, the behavior of functions like exponentials is highly dependent on their parameters. Without additional constraints or information about the original \\( z \\), it is generally not possible to uniquely determine \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) just from \\( H(s) \\). This is because multiple combinations of \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) could yield the same transformed function \\( H(s) \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

Assuming a similar form for simplicity, let's consider the \"transformed\" function \\( H(s) \\) which might be related to \\( g(z) \\).\n\n3. **Transforming \\( g(z) \\)**: If we assume a similar form for \\( H(s) \\), we might have:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(z) e^{-sz} dz\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( g(z) = e^{\\lambda z} \\):\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{\\lambda z} e^{-sz} dz = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(\\lambda - s)z} dz\n   \\]\n\n4. **Analyzing \\( H(s) \\)**: For the integral to converge, the real part of \\( \\lambda - s \\) must be negative.
