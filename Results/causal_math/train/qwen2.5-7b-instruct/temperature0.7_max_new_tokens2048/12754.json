    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Integral and Transformation:**\n   The original integral is \\( I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\cos(tx) \\, dx \\).\n   We apply the transformation \\( u = ax + b \\).

Specifically:\n   - \\( a \\) scales the width of the Gaussian function.\n   - \\( b \\) shifts the Gaussian function along the x-axis.\n\n4. **Intervention Analysis:**\n   If we change the function to \\( f(u) = e^{-au^2 + b} \\cos(tu) \\) halfway through the computation, this is not a standard or typical way to handle the integral. Typically, such changes would complicate the integral rather than simplify it.\n\n5. **Final Result Dependence:**\n   The key point is whether the final result depends solely on the original adjustments made by \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Changing the function mid-way introduces a new term \\( e^b \\) which does not directly follow from the initial transformation and could alter the integral's behavior significantly.\n\nGiven these points, the final result will not solely depend on the original variable adjustments made by \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) if the function is changed midway through the computation.\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Integral**: We start with the integral \\( I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\cos(tx) \\, dx \\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: The transformation suggested is \\( u = ax + b \\). To apply this, we need to change the limits of integration and the differential \\( dx \\):\n   - When \\( x = -\\infty \\), \\( u = -\\infty \\).\n   - When \\( x = \\infty \\), \\( u = \\infty \\).\n   - \\( dx = \\frac{du}{a} \\).\n\n3. **Transformed Integral**: Substituting these into the original integral gives:\n   \\[\n   I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(\\frac{u-b}{a})^2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{tu-bt}{a}\\right) \\frac{du}{a}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   I = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{(u-b)^2}{a^2}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{tu-bt}{a}\\right) du\n   \\]\n\n4. **Intervention**: The problem asks about changing the function to \\( f(u) = e^{-au^2+b} \\cos(tu) \\) halfway through computation.

Changing it to \\( e^{-au^2 + b} \\) introduces additional complexity because the shift \\( b \\) now appears linearly rather than as a shift in the argument of the exponential.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The intervention changes the form of the integrand significantly, and thus the final result will not only depend on the original variable adjustments but also on the new form introduced by the intervention.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Integral and Transformation**:\n   - We start with the integral \\( I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\cos(tx) \\, dx \\).\n   - We apply the transformation \\( u = ax + b \\). This implies \\( du = a \\, dx \\), and the limits of integration change accordingly (though for improper integrals from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), the limits remain \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\)).\n\n2. **Transforming the Integral**:\n   - Substituting \\( u = ax + b \\) into the integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(ax + b)^2} \\cos(t(ax + b)) \\frac{du}{a}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we have:\n     \\[\n     I = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-a^2x^2 - 2abx - b^2} \\cos(tax + tb) \\, du\n     \\]\n\n3. **Impact of Constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - The term \\(e^{-a^2x^2 - 2abx - b^2}\\) is transformed based on \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n   - The argument of the cosine function is affected by both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n4. **Intervention and New Function**:\n   - If an intervention changes the function to \\( f(u) = e^{-au^2 + b} \\cos(tu) \\) halfway through the computation, it means we are now dealing with a new form of the function.\n   - This new form does not follow the same transformation rules as the initial integral because it introduces a different structure in the exponent and the argument of the cosine.\n\n5. **Dependence on Original Adjustments**:\n   - The original integral's behavior was dependent on the constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) through the transformation \\(u = ax + b\\).\n   - The intervention changes the function to a form that no longer directly follows the transformation rules of the original integral. Therefore, the final result will not solely depend on the original variable adjustments made by \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the final result will not only depend on the original variable adjustments made by \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
