The effect of \\(T(y)\\) is more about how the state vector evolves over time due to the matrix \\(K\\).\n\n6. **Impact of Control Modification**: After \\(t_1\\), the control input \\(u(t)\\) changes. This change will be reflected in the dynamics of the system through the term \\(Nu(t)\\) in the differential equation.
