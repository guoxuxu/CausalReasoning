Since \\( z(0) = 1 \\), we have \\( T(1) = a \\cdot 1 + b = a + b \\).\n\n2. **Effect on \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - After applying \\( T \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), the new initial condition for \\( z(t) \\) becomes \\( z(0) = a + b \\).\n   - However, \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a periodic function with period \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega} \\). This means that regardless of the initial value \\( a + b \\) (as long as it lies on the unit circle in the complex plane), \\( z(t) \\) will still follow the same periodic behavior: \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n3. **Complex Logarithm Function**:\n   - The function \\( w(t) = \\log(z(t)) \\) involves taking the complex logarithm of \\( z(t) \\).\n   - For \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), the complex logarithm is \\( w(t) = \\log(e^{i\\omega t}) = i\\omega t + 2k\\pi i \\) for some integer \\( k \\). The principal value is \\( i\\omega t \\).\n\n4. **Effect of Transformation on \\( w(t) \\)**:\n   - When \\( z(t) \\) starts from \\( a + b \\) instead of 1, the phase of \\( z(t) \\) is shifted.\n   - If \\( a + b = e^{i\\phi} \\) (where \\( \\phi \\) is the phase shift), then \\( z(t) = e^{i(\\omega t + \\phi)} \\).\n   - Consequently, \\( w(t) = \\log(e^{i(\\omega t + \\phi)}) = i(\\omega t + \\phi) + 2k\\pi i = i\\omega t + i\\phi + 2k\\pi i \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The transformation \\( T \\) affects the initial phase of \\( z(t) \\), but the overall form of \\( w(t) \\) remains \\( i\\omega t \\) plus a constant phase shift \\( i\\phi \\).\n   - Therefore, the trajectory of \\( w(t) \\) is affected by the transformation \\( T \\), specifically by adding a constant phase shift.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
