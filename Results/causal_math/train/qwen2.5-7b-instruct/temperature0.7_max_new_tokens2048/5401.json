    "To answer this question, let's break down the problem and analyze it step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k\\Delta u\\) describes how the temperature \\(u(x,t)\\) changes over time due to heat diffusion.

Here, \\( k \\) is the thermal diffusivity, and \\( \\Delta \\) is the Laplacian operator.\n\n2. **Localized Heating Representation**: The function \\( \\delta(x - x_0) \\) represents a Dirac delta function centered at \\( x_0 \\). This function is used to model a sudden, intense heating event at a specific spatial location \\( x_0 \\).\n\n3. **Application at Time \\( t_0 \\)**: The problem specifies that this localized heating occurs at time \\( t_0 \\).
