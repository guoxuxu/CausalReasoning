    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what the Laplace transform does to the function \\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\).\n\n2.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function \\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\) where \\( z \\) is a complex number and \\( A \\) is a complex matrix. Here, \\( e^{Az} \\) is understood as the matrix exponential of \\( A \\) times \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**: We need to apply the Laplace transform to \\( w(z) \\).
