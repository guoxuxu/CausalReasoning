    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Complex Function**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a complex exponential function. This function oscillates with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Applying to a Signal**: If we apply this function to a time-domain signal \\( x(t) \\), it results in \\( x(t) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\). This multiplication in the time domain corresponds to a modulation in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Analysis**: The Fourier Transform \\( F(\\omega) \\) converts the time-domain signal into its frequency-domain representation. When we multiply \\( x(t) \\) by \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), the Fourier Transform of the resulting signal \\( x(t) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} \\) will show a shift in the frequency spectrum. Specifically, it will cause a phase shift and a possible amplitude change depending on the properties of \\( x(t) \\).\n\n4. **Effect of the Phase Shift**: The term \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) introduces a phase shift in the frequency spectrum. This means that the frequency components of \\( x(t) \\) will appear at the same frequencies but with a different phase. The amplitude of these components might also change, but the presence of the phase shift indicates that the frequency spectrum alone does not determine the outcome.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since applying \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) introduces a phase shift, the frequency spectrum \\( F(\\omega) \\) at \\( \\omega \\) will not be solely determined by \\( x(t) \\).
