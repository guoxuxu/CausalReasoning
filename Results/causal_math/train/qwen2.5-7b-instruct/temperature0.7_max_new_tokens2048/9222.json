    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the PDE \\(u_t = Lu\\), which describes how the function \\(u\\) changes over time.\n\n2.

The key point here is that the Fourier transform is a one-to-one transformation. This means that each unique function has a unique Fourier transform, and vice versa.\n\n6. Therefore, if we know \\(\\hat{u}(T)\\) and can solve the ODE backwards, we can uniquely determine \\(\\hat{u}(0)\\).\n\n7.
