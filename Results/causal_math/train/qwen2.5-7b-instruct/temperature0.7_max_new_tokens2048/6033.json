    "To determine if doubling the initial conditions \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) will result in the Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) being twice that of the original system at \\( s = a \\), we need to consider the properties of the Laplace transform and how it relates to initial conditions.\n\n1. **Laplace Transform Definition**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-st} dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = X(s) + i Y(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), respectively.\n\n2. **Initial Conditions and Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a function with initial conditions can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{X(s)}{s - p} + \\frac{x(0)}{s}\n   \\]\n   for some parameter \\( p \\). Similarly for \\( Y(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{s - q} + \\frac{y(0)}{s}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are parameters depending on the system.\n\n3. **Effect of Doubling Initial Conditions**: If \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) are doubled, the new initial conditions become \\( 2x(0) \\) and \\( 2y(0) \\). Therefore, the new Laplace transforms \\( X'(s) \\) and \\( Y'(s) \\) will be:\n   \\[\n   X'(s) = \\frac{X(s)}{s - p} + \\frac{2x(0)}{s}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Y'(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{s - q} + \\frac{2y(0)}{s}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Transform at \\( s = a \\)**: At \\( s = a \\), the transforms become:\n   \\[\n   X'(a) = \\frac{X(a)}{a - p} + \\frac{2x(0)}{a}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Y'(a) = \\frac{Y(a)}{a - q} + \\frac{2y(0)}{a}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the new transform \\( Z'(a) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z'(a) = X'(a) + i Y'(a) = \\left( \\frac{X(a)}{a - p} + \\frac{2x(0)}{a} \\right) + i \\left( \\frac{Y(a)}{a - q} + \\frac{2y(0)}{a} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison with Original Transform**: The original transform at \\( s = a \\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z(a) = X(a) + i Y(a)\n   \\]\n   Clearly, \\( Z'(a) \\neq 2Z(a) \\) because the terms involving \\( \\frac{x(0)}{a} \\) and \\( \\frac{y(0)}{a} \\) do not scale linearly with the entire transform.\n\nTherefore, the Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) at \\( s = a \\) for the modified system is not simply twice that of the original system.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions and Laplace Transform**:\n   - The Laplace transform of a function \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z(t)e^{-st} dt \\).\n   - For \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\), the Laplace transform is \\( Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s) \\), where \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\) are the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), respectively.\n\n2. **Initial Conditions**:\n   - The initial conditions for \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\).\n   - The Laplace transforms of these initial conditions are \\( X(0) \\) and \\( Y(0) \\), respectively.\n   - Therefore, the initial values contribute directly to the Laplace transforms as follows:\n     \\[\n     X(0) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} sX(s)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     Y(0) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} sY(s)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Doubling the Initial Conditions**:\n   - If \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) are doubled at \\( t = 0 \\), the new initial conditions become \\( 2x(0) \\) and \\( 2y(0) \\).\n   - The Laplace transforms of these new initial conditions are:\n     \\[\n     2X(0) = 2\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} sX(s)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2Y(0) = 2\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} sY(s)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Effect on the Transform**:\n   - The Laplace transform of a function with doubled initial conditions at \\( t = 0 \\) does not simply double the entire transform \\( Z(s) \\). Instead, it affects the behavior of the transform near \\( s = 0 \\).\n   - Specifically, if we consider the effect on \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\) individually, doubling the initial conditions would change the behavior of \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\) such that:\n     \\[\n     X(s) \\rightarrow X(s) + \\frac{2x(0)}{s}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     Y(s) \\rightarrow Y(s) + \\frac{2y(0)}{s}\n     \\]\n   - However, the overall transform \\( Z(s) \\) would not simply double because the transform includes the integral from 0 to infinity, which is affected by the entire function \\( z(t) \\), not just the initial conditions.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Doubling the initial conditions does not result in the Laplace transform being exactly twice the original transform at any specific point \\( s = a \\). The relationship is more complex due to the nature of the Laplace transform and the contributions from the entire time domain.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
