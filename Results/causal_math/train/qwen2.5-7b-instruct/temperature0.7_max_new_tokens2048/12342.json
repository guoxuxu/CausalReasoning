Specifically, it is a shifted delta function with a complex shift:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}\\{y(t)\\} = \\frac{1}{i (\\omega - \\omega_0) + \\alpha}\n     \\]\n   - This indicates that the frequency spectrum now includes a single frequency component, but the presence of \\( \\alpha \\) modifies the amplitude and phase of this frequency component.\n\nGiven the above steps, the final frequency spectrum still only includes the frequency \\( \\omega \\), but the perturbation alters its amplitude and phase. Therefore, the frequencies other than \\( \\omega \\) are not introduced; the frequency \\( \\omega \\) remains the same but is modified.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Fourier Transform:**\n   - The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( Z(f) = \\delta(f - \\omega) + \\delta(f + \\omega) \\). This indicates that the frequency content is purely at \\( \\pm \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Perturbation:**\n   - We introduce a perturbation by multiplying \\( z(t) \\) with \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\).\n   - The new function becomes \\( y(t) = h(t) \\cdot z(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\cdot e^{i \\omega t} = e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t} \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of the Perturbed Function:**\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( y(t) = e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t} \\) is \\( Y(f) = \\delta(f - (\\omega - \\alpha)) + \\delta(f + (\\omega - \\alpha)) \\).\n   - This shows that the frequency content of \\( y(t) \\) is now centered around \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\) and \\( -(\\omega - \\alpha) \\).\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - The original frequency content was at \\( \\omega \\) and \\( -\\omega \\).\n   - The perturbed frequency content is now at \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\) and \\( -(\\omega - \\alpha) \\).\n\nSince the perturbation (multiplying by \\( h(t) \\)) shifts the frequency content from \\( \\omega \\) to \\( \\omega - \\alpha \\), it does indeed alter the final frequency spectrum to include different frequencies other than \\( \\omega \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Fourier Transform:**\n   - We start with the function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\).\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     Z(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i \\omega t} e^{-2\\pi i f t} dt = \\delta(f - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\n     \\]\n     This shows that the Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\( f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\). Thus, the initial frequency spectrum only includes the frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Perturbation by Multiplication with \\( h(t) \\):**\n   - Now, we consider multiplying \\( z(t) \\) by \\( h(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} \\) for \\( t > 0 \\) (assuming \\( h(t) = 0 \\) for \\( t \\leq 0 \\) for simplicity):\n     \\[\n     w(t) = h(t) \\cdot z(t) = e^{-\\alpha t} e^{i \\omega t} = e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t}\n     \\]\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( w(t) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     W(f) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(i \\omega - \\alpha)t} e^{-2\\pi i f t} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{t(i \\omega - \\alpha - 2\\pi i f)} dt\n     \\]\n     This integral converges if \\( \\alpha > 2\\pi f \\):\n     \\[\n     W(f) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{t(i \\omega - \\alpha - 2\\pi i f)}}{i \\omega - \\alpha - 2\\pi i f} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha - 2\\pi i f - i \\omega}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final Fourier Transform:**\n   - After applying the Fourier Transform to \\( w(t) \\), we get \\( W(f) \\), which is not just a delta function centered at \\( \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\). Instead, it is a more complex expression involving \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( f \\).\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that the perturbation by multiplying with \\( h(t) \\) does indeed alter the final frequency spectrum to include frequencies other than \\( \\omega \\). The Fourier Transform of the perturbed function \\( w(t) \\) includes contributions from all frequencies \\( f \\) such that \\( \\alpha > 2\\pi f \\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
