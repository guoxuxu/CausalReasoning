If we apply the Laplace transform to \\( w(t) \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   W(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} w(t) e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^t e^{-st} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(1-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n   For \\( s > 1 \\), this integral converges to \\( \\frac{1}{s-1} \\).

However, since the Fourier transform does not exist for \\( e^t \\), reverting it is not possible in the conventional sense.\n\n5. **Predictability of \\( w(T) \\) for \\( T > t_2 \\)**: Given that the Fourier transform does not exist for \\( e^t \\), applying and then reverting it would not provide any meaningful information about the behavior of \\( w(T) \\) for \\( T > t_2 \\).

However, since \\( w(z) = e^z \\) is already in a form that doesn't directly involve time derivatives (it's simply an exponential function), the Laplace transform might not add much new information in this context.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Application**: The Fourier transform is used to decompose a signal into its constituent frequencies.

It merely decomposes it into a sum of sinusoidal functions with different frequencies.
