The input \\( u(t) \\) is transformed using the Laplace transform to get \\( U(s) \\).\n\n2. **Intervention**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the control function is changed from \\( u(t) \\) to \\( v(t) = P(t)u(t) \\). This means that the new input to the system becomes \\( v(t) \\).\n\n3. **System Response**: The system response \\( x(t) \\) is given by the solution to the differential equation with the new input \\( v(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t) + Kv(t)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( v(t) = P(t)u(t) \\) into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t) + KP(t)u(t)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**: To find the final state \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\), we need to solve the differential equation from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\):\n   \\[\n   \\dot{x}(t) = Dx(t) + KP(t)u(t)\n   \\]\n   The solution to this differential equation will depend on both \\( D \\) and the product \\( KP(t)u(t) \\). Since \\( KP(t)u(t) \\) involves the transformation \\( P(t) \\) and the input \\( u(t) \\), the final state \\( x(T) \\) will be influenced by these factors.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the final state \\( x(T) \\) is determined by solving the differential equation from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\), and this equation includes the term \\( KP(t)u(t) \\), it is clear that the final state \\( x(T) \\) does depend on both \\( D \\) and the transformations \\( P(t) \\) and \\( U(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
