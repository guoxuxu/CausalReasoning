    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Convolution**: The original convolution between \\( f(x) \\) and \\( h(x) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   u(x) = (h * f)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) f(x - \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n\n2. **Transformation of Input**: The input \\( f(x) \\) is transformed by the linear operator \\( T \\) such that \\( f'(x) = f(x - a) \\). Now we need to find the convolution of \\( h(x) \\) with \\( f'(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   u'(x) = (h * f')(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) f'(x - \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( f'(x - \\tau) = f((x - \\tau) - a) = f(x - \\tau - a) \\):\n   \\[\n   u'(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) f(x - \\tau - a) d\\tau\n   \\]\n\n3. **Comparison with Original Convolution**: Compare \\( u'(x) \\) with \\( u(x) \\):\n   \\[\n   u(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) f(x - \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   Notice that \\( u'(x) \\) can be rewritten by shifting the variable of integration:\n   \\[\n   u'(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) f(x - \\tau - a) d\\tau = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) f((x - a) - \\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   By making a change of variables \\( \\tau' = \\tau + a \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   u'(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau' - a) f(x - \\tau') d\\tau'\n   \\]\n   Since \\( h(\\tau) \\) is the impulse response function, it should not depend on \\( a \\) in a way that changes its value for different \\( \\tau \\). Therefore:\n   \\[\n   u'(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) f(x - \\tau - a) d\\tau = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} h(\\tau) f(x - \\tau) d\\tau \\Bigg|_{\\tau \\rightarrow \\tau + a}\n   \\]\n   This shows that \\( u'(x) \\) is indeed the same as \\( u(x) \\) but evaluated at \\( x - a \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The transformed input \\( f'(x) = f(x - a) \\) when convolved with \\( h(x) \\) results in a shifted version of the original convolution \\( u(x) \\).
