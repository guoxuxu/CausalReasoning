Therefore, the initial conditions will affect the overall shape and magnitude of the frequency spectrum, but specifically at \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\), the value will depend on the entire history of \\(z(t)\\), not just the initial condition.\n\nGiven this analysis, the initial conditions do influence the Fourier transform as a whole, but the value at a specific frequency \\(\\omega = \\omega_0\\) is not solely determined by the initial condition at \\(t=0\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
