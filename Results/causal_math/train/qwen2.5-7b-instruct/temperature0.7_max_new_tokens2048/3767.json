    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original Differential Equation**:\n   The original differential equation governing the charge \\( Q(t) \\) on the capacitor is:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{Q} = -\\frac{Q}{RC} + I(t)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( R \\) is the resistance, \\( C \\) is the capacitance, and \\( I(t) \\) is the external current source.\n\n2. **Modification to the Circuit**:\n   At time \\( t_1 \\), the resistance is changed to \\( R' \\). This means the differential equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{Q} = -\\frac{Q}{R'C} + I(t)\n   \\]\n   for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Intervention with Pulse Current**:\n   A controlled current pulse \\( J(t) = \\alpha e^{-\\beta t} \\) is introduced at \\( t = t_1 \\). This pulse will affect the system starting from \\( t_1 \\). The new differential equation now includes the pulse current:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{Q} = -\\frac{Q}{R'C} + I(t) + J(t)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Endpoint Analysis**:\n   To determine if \\( Q(T) \\) depends only on the initial resistance \\( R \\) and not on \\( R' \\) or the pulse parameters, we need to consider the behavior of \\( Q(t) \\) after the pulse starts.\n\n   - **Before \\( t_1 \\)**: The system behaves as if it had resistance \\( R \\).\n   - **After \\( t_1 \\)**: The system has resistance \\( R' \\) and the pulse current \\( J(t) \\) is added.\n\n5. **Impact of Changing \\( R \\) to \\( R' \\)**:\n   The change in resistance \\( R \\) to \\( R' \\) affects the rate of change of \\( Q(t) \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\). However, the initial conditions (which depend on the state of the system just before \\( t_1 \\)) will still be influenced by the original resistance \\( R \\).\n\n6. **Inclusion of Pulse Current**:\n   The pulse current \\( J(t) \\) adds a transient component to the system. This pulse will modify the charge \\( Q(t) \\) but its effect will decay over time due to the exponential term \\( e^{-\\beta t} \\).\n\n7. **Final State Analysis**:\n   For \\( T > t_1 \\), the system will have evolved under the influence of both the modified resistance \\( R' \\) and the pulse current \\( J(t) \\). The final charge \\( Q(T) \\) will be a combination of these factors.\n\nGiven that the system's behavior is influenced by both the initial resistance \\( R \\) and the changes made (new resistance \\( R' \\) and pulse current \\( J(t) \\)), the endpoint \\( Q(T) \\) cannot be said to depend solely on the initial resistance \\( R \\) without considering \\( R' \\) and the pulse parameters.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
