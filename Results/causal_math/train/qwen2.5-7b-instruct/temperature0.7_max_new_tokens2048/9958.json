    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE**: The given PDE is \\(\\nabla^2 u(x,t) = -\\lambda u(x,t)\\). This is a Helmholtz equation, which describes wave-like phenomena in a medium with constant properties.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\(F(u)\\) converts the spatial component of the function \\(u(x,t)\\) into the frequency domain. For the Helmholtz equation, the Fourier transform results in a simple algebraic relationship in the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Frequency Domain Representation**: Taking the Fourier transform of both sides of the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   -k^2 F(u)(k,t) = -\\lambda F(u)(k,t)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we find:\n   \\[\n   (k^2 - \\lambda) F(u)(k,t) = 0\n   \\]\n   Since \\(k^2 - \\lambda = 0\\) implies \\(k = \\pm\\sqrt{\\lambda}\\), the solution in the frequency domain is:\n   \\[\n   F(u)(k,t) = A e^{-i\\sqrt{\\lambda}t} + B e^{i\\sqrt{\\lambda}t}\n   \\]\n   where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants that depend on the initial conditions.\n\n4. **Initial Condition**: To determine the constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we need the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\). The inverse Fourier transform of \\(F(u)(k,0)\\) gives us \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\n5. **Deduction of Initial State**: Given \\(F(u)(k,T)\\) at some time \\(T\\), we know:\n   \\[\n   F(u)(k,T) = A e^{-i\\sqrt{\\lambda}T} + B e^{i\\sqrt{\\lambda}T}\n   \\]\n   However, without knowing \\(u(x,0)\\) or \\(F(u)(k,0)\\), we cannot uniquely determine \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). These constants are dependent on the initial state \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we cannot deduce the initial transformed state \\(F(u)(k,0)\\) from \\(F(u)(k,T)\\) alone, as it requires knowledge of the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To address this problem, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Understand the given PDE**: The given partial differential equation (PDE) is \\(\\nabla^2 u(x,t) = -\\lambda u(x,t)\\). This is a wave-like equation with a negative eigenvalue \\(-\\lambda\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform \\(F\\) to both sides of the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[\\nabla^2 u(x,t)] = \\mathcal{F}[-\\lambda u(x,t)]\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Fourier transform for the Laplacian operator, \\(\\mathcal{F}[\\nabla^2 u(x,t)] = (ik)^2 F(u)(k,t) = -k^2 F(u)(k,t)\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   -k^2 F(u)(k,t) = -\\lambda F(u)(k,t)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   k^2 F(u)(k,t) = \\lambda F(u)(k,t)\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\lambda > 0\\), this implies that \\(F(u)(k,t)\\) must be an eigenfunction of the operator \\(k^2 - \\lambda\\).\n\n3. **Eigenfunctions in the Frequency Domain**: The solution to the above equation in the frequency domain is of the form:\n   \\[\n   F(u)(k,t) = A(k)e^{-i\\sqrt{\\lambda}kt} + B(k)e^{i\\sqrt{\\lambda}kt}\n   \\]\n   where \\(A(k)\\) and \\(B(k)\\) are the Fourier transforms of the initial conditions at \\(t=0\\).\n\n4. **Initial Condition Transformation**: To find \\(F(u)(k,0)\\), we consider the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\):\n   \\[\n   F(u)(k,0) = A(k) + B(k)\n   \\]\n   From the solution above, we see that \\(F(u)(k,t)\\) at any time \\(t\\) can be expressed in terms of the initial Fourier transform \\(F(u)(k,0)\\) with a time-dependent phase factor.\n\n5. **Deducing Initial State from Transformed State**: Given \\(F(u)(k,T)\\) at some time \\(T\\), we need to determine if it allows us to deduce \\(F(u)(k,0)\\) without knowing \\(u(x,0)\\). Since \\(F(u)(k,t)\\) evolves as:\n   \\[\n   F(u)(k,t) = (A(k) + B(k))e^{-i\\sqrt{\\lambda}kt} + (A(k) - B(k))e^{i\\sqrt{\\lambda}kt}\n   \\]\n   At \\(t=0\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   F(u)(k,0) = A(k) + B(k)\n   \\]\n   And at \\(t=T\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   F(u)(k,T) = (A(k) + B(k))e^{-i\\sqrt{\\lambda}kT} + (A(k) - B(k))e^{i\\sqrt{\\lambda}kT}\n   \\]\n   By comparing these two expressions, we can solve for \\(A(k)\\) and \\(B(k)\\), but we do not need to know \\(u(x,0)\\) directly because \\(A(k)\\) and \\(B(k)\\) are already determined by the initial Fourier transform \\(F(u)(k,0)\\).\n\nTherefore, knowing \\(F(u)(k,T)\\) allows us to deduce \\(F(u)(k,0)\\) without needing the explicit form of \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
