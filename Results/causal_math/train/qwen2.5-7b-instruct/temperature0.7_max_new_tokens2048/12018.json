    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function and Integral Transformation**:\n   - The original function is \\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\).\n   - Under the integral transformation \\( T[f](z) = \\int_0^z f(s) ds \\), we need to consider the effect on \\( w(z) \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation of \\( w(z) \\)**:\n   - Applying the integral transformation to \\( w(z) \\):\n     \\[\n     T[w](z) = \\int_0^z e^{As} ds\n     \\]\n   - To solve this integral, we use the antiderivative of \\( e^{As} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int e^{As} ds = \\frac{e^{As}}{A}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore,\n     \\[\n     T[w](z) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{As}}{A} \\right]_0^z = \\frac{e^{Az} - 1}{A}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Intervention Operation**:\n   - An intervention operation \\( g(w) = e^{Bw} \\) is applied at \\( z_2 \\). This means at \\( z = z_2 \\), the function becomes \\( e^{B \\cdot e^{Az_2}} \\).\n\n4. **Behavior for \\( z_1 > z_2 \\)**:\n   - For \\( z_1 > z_2 \\), we need to consider the integral transformation from \\( z_2 \\) to \\( z_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     T[g](z_1) = \\int_{z_2}^{z_1} e^{Bs} ds\n     \\]\n   - Using the antiderivative again:\n     \\[\n     \\int e^{Bs} ds = \\frac{e^{Bs}}{B}\n     \\]\n   - Thus,\n     \\[\n     T[g](z_1) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{Bs}}{B} \\right]_{z_2}^{z_1} = \\frac{e^{Bz_1} - e^{Bz_2}}{B}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Comparison with Original Integral Transformation**:\n   - The original integral transformation of \\( w(z) \\) up to \\( z_1 \\) would be:\n     \\[\n     T[w](z_1) = \\frac{e^{Az_1} - 1}{A}\n     \\]\n   - The effect of the intervention \\( g(w) = e^{Bw} \\) at \\( z_2 \\) changes the function dynamics, introducing a new exponential term \\( e^{Bz_2} \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The presence of the intervention \\( g(w) = e^{Bw} \\) at \\( z_2 \\) modifies the function in a way that it cannot simply be described as the integral transformation of \\( e^{Az} \\) alone.
