However, the presence of the sinusoidal signal would introduce a periodic fluctuation into the voltage waveform.\n\n4. **Inference Without Additional Data**: Without additional data such as the exact form of the voltage waveform over a range of times, the presence of fluctuations alone does not definitively prove that the sinusoidal signal was added. Fluctuations could be caused by other factors as well. For example, if the system were initially at rest and then suddenly received a sinusoidal input, the transient response might include significant fluctuations.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While the sinusoidal signal would contribute to the observed fluctuations, it is not sufficient to definitively conclude that the sinusoidal signal was the cause of the fluctuations without further analysis or data.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the reasoning above, we cannot definitively infer that the sinusoidal signal was added to the input voltage without additional data.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
