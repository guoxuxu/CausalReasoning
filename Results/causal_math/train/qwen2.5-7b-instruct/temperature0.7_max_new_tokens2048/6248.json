    "To determine if we can specifically identify whether the transformation \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) or \\( e^{i\\beta t} \\) was applied based on the integral transform \\( Z(s) \\), let's analyze the effect of each transformation on \\( Z(s) \\).\n\n1. **Transformation with \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\):**\n   - Given \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\),\n   - Applying the transformation \\( z(t) \\rightarrow e^{i\\omega t}z(t) \\),\n   - We get \\( z'(t) = e^{i\\omega t}(x(t) + iy(t)) \\).\n   - The new \\( Z(s) \\) would be:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} z(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i\\omega)t} z(t) dt.\n     \\]\n   - This can be rewritten as:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i\\omega)t} z(t) dt = \\frac{Z(s-i\\omega)}{1}.\n     \\]\n\n2. **Transformation with \\( e^{i\\beta t} \\):**\n   - Similarly, applying the transformation \\( z(t) \\rightarrow e^{i\\beta t}z(t) \\),\n   - We get \\( z''(t) = e^{i\\beta t}(x(t) + iy(t)) \\).\n   - The new \\( Z(s) \\) would be:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{i\\beta t} z(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i\\beta)t} z(t) dt.\n     \\]\n   - This can be rewritten as:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i\\beta)t} z(t) dt = \\frac{Z(s-i\\beta)}{1}.\n     \\]\n\nFrom the above derivations, we see that the integral transform \\( Z(s) \\) changes in a specific way depending on the frequency shift introduced by the exponential term.

Applying this transformation, the new function becomes:\n   \\[\n   z''(t) = e^{i\\beta t}z(t)\n   \\]\n   Taking the Laplace transform of \\( z''(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   Z''(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{i\\beta t} z(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i\\beta)t} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   Similarly, this can be rewritten using the property of Laplace transforms:\n   \\[\n   Z''(s) = e^{i\\beta t} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt = e^{i\\beta t} Z(s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Observing \\( Z(s) \\) at Time \\( T \\)**: At any time \\( t \\), the Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) is a function of the original \\( z(t) \\) and does not directly reveal the specific transformation applied unless we know the form of \\( Z(s) \\) before the transformation.
