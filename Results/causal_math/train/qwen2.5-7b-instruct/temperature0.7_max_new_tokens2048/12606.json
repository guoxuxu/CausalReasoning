If they commute, the order of applying them does not matter, and thus the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) would be independent of the initial transformation by \\( h(z) \\). However, if they do not commute, the order matters, and the endpoint would depend on the sequence of transformations.\n\nIn general, for arbitrary operators \\( D \\) and \\( E \\) and matrices \\( S \\) and \\( Q \\), there is no guarantee that \\( h(z) \\) and \\( k(z) \\) will commute.
