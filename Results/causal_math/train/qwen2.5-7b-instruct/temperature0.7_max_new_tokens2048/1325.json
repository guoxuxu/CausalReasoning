  "Explanation": "The squaring function \\\\( g(z) = z^2 \\\\) alters the input for the exponential function significantly. The function \\\\( e^{iz^2} \\\\) and \\\\( e^{iz} \\\\) represent vastly different transformations; squaring affects the rate and nature of oscillations in the complex exponential.",
