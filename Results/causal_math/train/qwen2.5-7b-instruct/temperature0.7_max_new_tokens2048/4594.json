Therefore, for small \\( x \\), the term \\( e^{-sx} \\approx 1 \\).\n\n3. **Behavior Near \\( x = 0 \\)**:\n   - For \\( H(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} h(x)g(x) \\, dx\n     \\]\n   - Near \\( x = 0 \\), if \\( h(x) \\) is continuous and non-zero at \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( h(x) \\approx h(0) \\) for small \\( x \\). Thus,\n     \\[\n     H(s) \\approx h(0) \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) \\, dx = h(0) G(s)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Deducing \\( g(0) \\)**:\n   - From the above approximation, \\( H(s) \\approx h(0) G(s) \\).\n   - If we know \\( H(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\), we can solve for \\( h(0) \\):\n     \\[\n     h(0) = \\frac{H(s)}{G(s)}\n     \\]\n   - However, to find \\( g(0) \\), we need to consider the behavior of the integrals more carefully. Specifically, we need to evaluate the integrals at \\( x = 0 \\) directly:\n     \\[\n     G(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} g(x) \\, dx \\quad \\text{and} \\quad H(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} h(x)g(x) \\, dx\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( e^{-sx} \\approx 1 \\) near \\( x = 0 \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     H(s) \\approx h(0) G(s)\n     \\]\n   - But to isolate \\( g(0) \\), we need to consider the limit as \\( s \\to \\infty \\):\n     \\[\n     \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} H(s) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-sx} h(x)g(x) \\, dx = h(0) g(0)\n     \\]\n   - This implies that \\( g(0) \\) cannot be directly deduced from \\( H(s) \\) alone without knowledge of \\( h(0) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Without additional information about \\( h(x) \\), particularly \\( h(0) \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine \\( g(0) \\) from \\( H(s) \\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
