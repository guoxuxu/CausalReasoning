    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral**: \n   - The function \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) has a singularity at \\( z = 0 \\).\n   - For a closed curve around \\( z = 0 \\), the integral of \\( f(z) \\) is known to be \\( 2\\pi i \\). This is a consequence of the Cauchy Integral Formula for the derivative of a holomorphic function.\n\n2. **Cauchy Integral Theorem**:\n   - According to the Cauchy Integral Theorem, if a function is holomorphic (analytic) in a simply connected domain, then the integral of the function over any closed curve in that domain is zero.\n   - However, \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{z} \\) is not holomorphic at \\( z = 0 \\), which means the theorem does not apply directly here.\n\n3. **Integral Over Different Circles**:\n   - Consider a circle \\( C_R \\) of radius \\( R \\) centered at the origin.
