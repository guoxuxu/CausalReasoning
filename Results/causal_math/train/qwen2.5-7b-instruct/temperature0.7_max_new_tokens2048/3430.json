    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Fourier Transform Basics**: The Fourier transform converts a function from its original domain (often time or space) into a representation in the frequency domain. For a function \\(f(x)\\), its Fourier transform is \\(F(\\omega)\\).\n\n2. **Convolution in Time Domain**: Convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain. If \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) are two functions, their convolution in the time domain, denoted as \\((f * g)(x)\\), results in a function whose Fourier transform is \\(F(\\omega)G(\\omega)\\).\n\n3. **Given Information**: We know that the result of the convolution in the time domain leads to a multiplication by \\(G(\\omega)\\) in the frequency domain. This means we have \\(F(\\omega)G(\\omega)\\) but not individual \\(F(\\omega)\\) and \\(G(\\omega)\\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness Problem**: The question asks if we can uniquely determine \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) from just \\(F(\\omega)G(\\omega)\\). \n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To go back from \\(F(\\omega)G(\\omega)\\) to the time domain, we would need to perform an inverse Fourier transform. However, without knowing the individual transforms \\(F(\\omega)\\) and \\(G(\\omega)\\), we cannot directly separate them from the product \\(F(\\omega)G(\\omega)\\).\n\n6. **Non-uniqueness**: There are multiple pairs of \\(F(\\omega)\\) and \\(G(\\omega)\\) that could multiply to give the same \\(F(\\omega)G(\\omega)\\).

Mathematically, if \\( h(x) = f(x) * g(x) \\) (where * denotes convolution), then \\( H(\\omega) = F(\\omega)G(\\omega) \\).\n\n2. **Given Information**:\n   - We know \\( F(\\omega)G(\\omega) \\) in the frequency domain.\n   - We want to determine if \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) can be uniquely determined from \\( F(\\omega)G(\\omega) \\).\n\n3. **Reversing the Process**:\n   - To find \\( f(x) \\) and \\( g(x) \\) from \\( F(\\omega)G(\\omega) \\), we would need to reverse the process:\n     1.
