    "To determine if adding a constant matrix \\( C \\) to both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) changes the outcome of the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, let's reason through the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Initial Conditions and Differential Equations:**\n   - Before time \\( t_1 \\), we have \\( \\dot{x}(t) = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y}(t) = By \\).\n   - After time \\( t_1 \\), we have \\( \\dot{x}'(t) = (A + C)x \\) and \\( \\dot{y}'(t) = (B + C)y \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Properties:**\n   - The Laplace transform of a derivative \\( \\dot{x}(t) \\) is given by \\( sX(s) - x(0) \\), where \\( X(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( x(t) \\).\n   - For \\( \\dot{x}(t) = Ax \\), the Laplace transform is \\( sX(s) - x(0) = AX(s) \\). Solving for \\( X(s) \\), we get \\( X(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}x(0) \\).\n   - Similarly, for \\( \\dot{y}(t) = By \\), the Laplace transform is \\( Y(s) = (sI - B)^{-1}y(0) \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Adding \\( C \\):**\n   - After \\( t_1 \\), the new differential equations become \\( \\dot{x}'(t) = (A + C)x \\) and \\( \\dot{y}'(t) = (B + C)y \\).\n   - The Laplace transforms for these new equations would be:\n     - \\( sX'(s) - x'(t_1) = (A + C)X'(s) \\)\n     - \\( sY'(s) - y'(t_1) = (B + C)Y'(s) \\)\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - The Laplace transforms before and after \\( t_1 \\) are different due to the change in the system dynamics.\n   - Specifically, the matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are replaced by \\( A + C \\) and \\( B + C \\) respectively.\n   - This change affects the poles of the transfer functions, which in turn changes the form of the Laplace transforms.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are altered by adding \\( C \\), the Laplace transforms of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) will change from \\( t_1 \\) onwards.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
