    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Transformation**: The transformation given is \\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\).

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**:\n   - The transformation \\( f(z) = e^{St}z \\) scales the complex number \\( z \\) by a factor of \\( e^{St} \\).
