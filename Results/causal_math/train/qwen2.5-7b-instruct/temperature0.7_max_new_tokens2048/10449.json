In the first case, the integration is performed immediately after substituting \\( f(x, y) \\) into \\( g(z) \\). In the second case, the substitution is made first, and then the integration is performed at a specific time \\( t = T \\).\n\nSince the form of the integrand \\( e^{zt} \\) changes based on whether \\( t \\) is treated as a variable or a constant, the results will generally differ unless \\( t \\) is explicitly set to 0 immediately (which is not the case here).\n\nTherefore, the result does differ.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the result of applying the transformation \\( g(z) \\) to \\( f(x, y) \\) immediately differs from directly applying \\( g(z) \\) on \\( z = x^2 + iy^2 \\) at a later time \\( t = T \\), let's break down the process step-by-step.\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The given function is \\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( g(z) \\)**: The transformation is defined as \\( g(z) = \\int e^{zt} dz \\), where \\( t \\) is a real parameter.\n\n3. **Immediate Application**: If we apply \\( g(z) \\) immediately to \\( f(x, y) \\):\n   - We substitute \\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\) into \\( g(z) \\).\n   - This gives us \\( g(f(x, y)) = \\int e^{(x^2 + iy^2)t} dt \\).\n\n4. **Application at Later Time \\( t = T \\)**: If we apply \\( g(z) \\) on \\( z = x^2 + iy^2 \\) at a later time \\( t = T \\):\n   - We substitute \\( z = x^2 + iy^2 \\) and \\( t = T \\) into \\( g(z) \\).\n   - This gives us \\( g(x^2 + iy^2) = \\int e^{(x^2 + iy^2)T} dT \\).\n\n5. **Comparison**:\n   - In the immediate application, \\( t \\) is integrated over, which means the integral is performed with respect to \\( t \\).\n   - In the application at a later time \\( t = T \\), \\( t \\) is fixed at \\( T \\), and the integral is performed with respect to \\( T \\).\n\nThe key difference lies in the nature of the integration. In the first case, the integral is over \\( t \\), and in the second case, it is over \\( T \\). However, since \\( T \\) is just a specific value of \\( t \\), the two expressions are essentially the same in terms of the form of the integral. The only difference is that in the first case, the integral is taken over all values of \\( t \\), while in the second case, it is taken for a specific value of \\( t \\).\n\nGiven that the transformation \\( g(z) \\) is defined as an integral over \\( t \\), and the variable \\( t \\) is the same in both cases (just with different notations), the results should be equivalent when considering the integral form.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with the function \\( z = f(x, y) = x^2 + iy^2 \\), where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are real variables and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\n2. **Transformation \\( g(z) \\)**: The transformation is defined as \\( g(z) = \\int e^{zt} dt \\). Here, \\( t \\) is a real parameter.\n\n3. **Immediate Application of \\( g(z) \\)**: If we apply \\( g(z) \\) to \\( f(x, y) \\) immediately, we substitute \\( z = x^2 + iy^2 \\) into \\( g(z) \\):\n   - \\( g(f(x, y)) = \\int e^{(x^2 + iy^2)t} dt \\).\n\n4. **Evolution with Time \\( t \\)**: Letting \\( t \\) evolve over time, the expression becomes:\n   - \\( g(f(x, y)) = \\int_0^T e^{(x^2 + iy^2)t} dt \\), where \\( T \\) is some final time.\n\n5. **Direct Application at Later Time \\( t = T \\)**: Directly applying \\( g(z) \\) on \\( z = x^2 + iy^2 \\) at a later time \\( t = T \\) means:\n   - \\( g(x^2 + iy^2) = \\int e^{(x^2 + iy^2)t} dt \\) evaluated at \\( t = T \\).\n\n6. **Comparison**:\n   - The immediate application involves integrating from 0 to \\( T \\).\n   - The direct application at \\( t = T \\) involves evaluating the integral at a single point \\( t = T \\).\n\nThe difference lies in the bounds of integration. In the first case, we integrate over a range of \\( t \\) from 0 to \\( T \\), while in the second case, we evaluate the integral at a specific point \\( t = T \\).
