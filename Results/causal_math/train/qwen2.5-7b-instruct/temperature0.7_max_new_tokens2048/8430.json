    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine if we can deduce \\( z(0) \\) from \\( z(T) \\) without knowing whether the transformation \\( Tz \\) was applied.\n\n1. **Given Differential Equation**:\n   The function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) satisfies the differential equation \\( \\frac{d}{dt}z = Az \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex number. This implies that \\( z(t) \\) is an exponential function of time:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(0)e^{At}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( z(0) \\) is the initial condition at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Analysis**:\n   The transformation \\( Tz = \\int_0^t e^{B(t-\\tau)}z(\\tau)d\\tau \\) is applied.
