    "To determine whether the original or modified system governed the effect based on the given integral transformation results after an intervention, let's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Integral Transformation**: The integral \\(\\int_{C} \\frac{f(z)}{z - \\lambda_i} dz\\) is related to the residue theorem in complex analysis.
