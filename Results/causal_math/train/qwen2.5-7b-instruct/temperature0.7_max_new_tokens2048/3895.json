This implies that \\( z(t) = e^{Pt}z(0) \\).\n\n2. **Transformation T**: The transformation \\( T(z) = Me^{Qt}z \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\). So, we have:\n   \\[\n   T(z(t)) = Me^{Qt}e^{Pt}z(0) = Me^{(Q+P)t}z(0)\n   \\]\n   At time \\( t = t_1 \\), the transformed function is:\n   \\[\n   T(z(t_1)) = Me^{(Q+P)t_1}z(0)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Additional Transformation U**: An additional transformation \\( U(z) = Ne^{Rt}z \\) is applied at \\( t = t_1 \\). Applying this transformation to \\( T(z(t_1)) \\):\n   \\[\n   U(T(z(t_1))) = Ne^{Rt_1}Me^{(Q+P)t_1}z(0) = (NM)e^{(Q+P)t_1 + R t_1}z(0)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Endpoint**: The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) involves further evolution of the function from \\( t = t_1 \\) to \\( T \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{P(T - t_1)}U(T(z(t_1))) = e^{P(T - t_1)}(NM)e^{(Q+P)t_1 + R t_1}z(0)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = (NM)e^{P(T - t_1 + t_1 + t_1)}z(0) = (NM)e^{P(T)}z(0)\n   \\]\n\nFrom the above steps, it is clear that the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends on \\( P \\) through the term \\( e^{P(T)} \\), and does not directly depend on \\( Q \\) or \\( R \\) after the initial application of \\( T \\) and \\( U \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend only on \\( P \\) and not on \\( Q \\) or \\( R \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine if the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on \\( P \\) and not on \\( Q \\) or \\( R \\).\n\n1. **Initial Dynamics**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz\n   \\]\n   This implies that:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{Pt}z(0)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Transformation T**: Applying the transformation \\( T(z) = Me^{Qt}z \\):\n   - Substituting \\( z(t) \\) into \\( T \\):\n     \\[\n     T(z(t)) = Me^{Qt}e^{Pt}z(0) = Me^{(Q+P)t}z(0)\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, after applying \\( T \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     z(t_1) = Me^{(Q+P)t_1}z(0)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Additional Transformation U**: Applying the transformation \\( U(z) = Ne^{Rt}z \\) at \\( t = t_1 \\):\n   - Substituting \\( z(t_1) \\) into \\( U \\):\n     \\[\n     U(z(t_1)) = Ne^{R(t-t_1)}Me^{(Q+P)t_1}z(0) = Ne^{R(t-t_1)}Me^{(Q+P)t_1}z(0)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the exponentials:\n     \\[\n     U(z(t_1)) = Ne^{R(t-t_1)+Q+P}z(0)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Final Dynamics Post-U**: After applying \\( U \\), the function continues to evolve under the original dynamics:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{P(t-t_1)}Ne^{R(t-t_1)+Q+P}z(0) = e^{P(t-t_1)}Ne^{R(t-t_1)}e^{Q+P}z(0)\n   \\]\n   - Let \\( t > t_1 \\), then:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{P(T-t_1)}Ne^{R(T-t_1)}e^{Q+P}z(0)\n     \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**: The expression for \\( z(T) \\) includes terms involving both \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\). Specifically, \\( e^{Q+P} \\) and \\( e^{R(T-t_1)} \\) are dependent on \\( Q \\) and \\( R \\), respectively.
