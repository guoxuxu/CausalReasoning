At \\( t = 0 \\), \\( z(0) = e^{i\\omega \\cdot 0} = 1 \\). So, the initial form of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( 1 \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**:\n   The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{z(t)\\}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-2\\pi i \\xi t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{t(i\\omega - 2\\pi i \\xi)} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges only if \\( \\omega = 2\\pi \\xi \\), which simplifies the Fourier transform to a Dirac delta function:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i\\omega t}\\}(\\xi) = \\delta(\\xi - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Applying Linear Operator \\( L \\)**:\n   The linear operator \\( L \\) defined by \\( Lf(t) = tf(t) \\) modifies the function \\( z(t) \\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   Lz(t) = t e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   The Fourier transform of \\( Lz(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{Lz(t)\\}(\\xi) = \\mathcal{F}\\{t e^{i\\omega t}\\}(\\xi)\n   \\]\n   Using the property of Fourier transforms that \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{tf(t)\\}(\\xi) = -i \\frac{d}{d\\xi} \\mathcal{F}\\{f(t)\\}(\\xi)\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{t e^{i\\omega t}\\}(\\xi) = -i \\frac{d}{d\\xi} \\delta(\\xi - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}) = -i \\delta'(\\xi - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\delta' \\) is the derivative of the Dirac delta function.\n\n4. **Observing \\( z(T) \\)**:\n   Observing \\( z(T) \\) gives us the value of the function at a specific time point, but it does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the initial form of \\( z(t) \\) because \\( z(t) \\) is periodic and any phase shift can result in the same value at \\( t = T \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Without additional information about whether \\( L \\) was applied or the exact value of \\( T \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine the initial form of \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) from just observing its Fourier transform at \\( t = T \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
