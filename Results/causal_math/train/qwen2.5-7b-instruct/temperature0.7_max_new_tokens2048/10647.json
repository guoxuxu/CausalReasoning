Multiplying by \\( e^z \\) does not affect the analyticity (since \\( e^z \\) is also entire). The Fourier Transform of an analytic function generally does not preserve analyticity in the same sense, but the overall structure can be transformed. However, the subsequent multiplication by \\( g(z) \\) and another Fourier Transform do not inherently restore the original analytic properties of \\( f(z) \\) in a straightforward manner.\n  \n- **Behavior**: The Fourier Transform and multiplication by \\( g(z) \\) introduce new behaviors that are not directly linked to the original \\( f(z) \\). Specifically, the Fourier Transform converts the function from the time domain to the frequency domain, and the multiplication by \\( g(z) \\) in the frequency domain can significantly alter the function.\n\nGiven these considerations, the end state after these transformations will not exhibit the original traits of \\( f(z) \\) in a meaningful way that would allow us to directly infer the properties of \\( f(z) \\) from the transformed function.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
