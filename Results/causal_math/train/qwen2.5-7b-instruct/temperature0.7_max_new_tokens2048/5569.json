    "To determine whether the solution \\(y(t)\\) depends strictly on the parameters \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) of the differential equation, let's analyze the given information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation**: The differential equation is \\(\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0\\).\n\n2. **Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions are \\(y(0) = y_0\\) and \\(y'(0) = y'_0\\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform Application**: Applying the Laplace transform to the differential equation converts it into an algebraic equation involving \\(Y(s)\\), the Laplace transform of \\(y(t)\\).\n\n4. **Transformed Equation**: The transformed equation will be in terms of \\(s\\), \\(p\\), \\(q\\), \\(y_0\\), and \\(y'_0\\). Solving for \\(Y(s)\\) involves these parameters.\n\n5. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The solution \\(y(t)\\) is obtained by taking the inverse Laplace transform of \\(Y(s)\\).\n\n6. **Dependence Analysis**:\n   - \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) directly appear in the transformed equation.\n   - \\(y_0\\) and \\(y'_0\\) are constants that appear in the transformed equation as well but do not affect the form of the solution in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n   - The form of the solution \\(y(t)\\) will inherently include \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) because they determine the characteristic equation whose roots influence the nature of the solution (e.g., exponential, oscillatory).\n\nGiven this analysis, the solution \\(y(t)\\) does indeed depend on \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) through the characteristic equation and its roots, which dictate the form of the solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation**: The given differential equation is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation of the form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0\n   \\]\n   This type of equation can be solved using various methods, including the Laplace transform.\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform**:\n   - Let \\(Y(s)\\) be the Laplace transform of \\(y(t)\\).\n   - Applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation, we get:\n     \\[\n     s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) + p(sY(s) - y(0)) + qY(s) = 0\n     \\]\n   - Substituting the initial conditions \\(y(0) = y_0\\) and \\(y'(0) = y'_0\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     s^2Y(s) - sy_0 - y'_0 + psY(s) - py_0 + qY(s) = 0\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     (s^2 + ps + q)Y(s) = sy_0 + y'_0 + py_0\n     \\]\n   - Therefore,\n     \\[\n     Y(s) = \\frac{sy_0 + y'_0 + py_0}{s^2 + ps + q}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - To find \\(y(t)\\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\(Y(s)\\):\n     \\[\n     y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left[\\frac{sy_0 + y'_0 + py_0}{s^2 + ps + q}\\right]\n     \\]\n   - This expression depends on \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) through the denominator polynomial \\(s^2 + ps + q\\).\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The solution \\(y(t)\\) is influenced by \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) because these parameters appear in the denominator of the transformed equation.\n   - However, the initial conditions \\(y_0\\) and \\(y'_0\\) also influence the solution but in a way that is not independent of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the form of the solution \\(y(t)\\) involves \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) in the denominator, it is clear that \\(y(t)\\) does depend on \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
