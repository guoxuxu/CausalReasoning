However, the term \\(V(s)\\) does depend on the new function \\(v(t)\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the future state of \\(Z(s)\\) (for \\(t > t_1\\)) includes the Laplace Transform of \\(v(t)\\) (\\(V(s)\\)), the future state of \\(Z(s)\\) does indeed depend on the new function \\(v(t)\\) after the adjustment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",
    "To determine whether the future state of \\( Z(s) \\) depends solely on the new function \\( v(t) \\) after the adjustment at \\( t_1 \\), we need to analyze how the Laplace transform behaves with respect to changes in the input function.\n\n1. **Initial System**: The initial system is described by \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} + u(t) \\). Applying the Laplace transform to this equation gives:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\} + \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the known Laplace transform properties, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i \\omega t}\\} = \\frac{s - i \\omega}{(s - i \\omega)^2 + \\omega^2}\n   \\]\n   So,\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{s - i \\omega}{(s - i \\omega)^2 + \\omega^2} + \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Change in Input**: At \\( t = t_1 \\), the input function is changed from \\( u(t) \\) to \\( v(t) \\). This change affects the system's behavior starting from \\( t_1 \\). The new system can be described as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} + v(t) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\geq t_1\n   \\]\n   Applying the Laplace transform to the new system for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\frac{s - i \\omega}{(s - i \\omega)^2 + \\omega^2} + \\mathcal{L}\\{v(t)\\}_{t \\geq t_1}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Impulse Response**: To fully capture the effect of the change, we need to consider the impulse response of the system. The impulse response due to the change in input from \\( u(t) \\) to \\( v(t) \\) at \\( t_1 \\) can be represented as:\n   \\[\n   h(t) = \\delta(t - t_1)(v(t) - u(t))\n   \\]\n   The Laplace transform of this impulse response is:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = e^{-t_1 s} (V(s) - U(s))\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the complete Laplace transform \\( Z_{\\text{new}}(s) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   Z_{\\text{new}}(s) = \\frac{s - i \\omega}{(s - i \\omega)^2 + \\omega^2} + e^{-t_1 s} (V(s) - U(s))\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The term \\( e^{-t_1 s} (V(s) - U(s)) \\) indicates that the future state of \\( Z(s) \\) does indeed depend on both the original function \\( u(t) \\) and the new function \\( v(t) \\) through the impulse response. Thus, the future state of \\( Z(s) \\) does not solely depend on the new function \\( v(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
