    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the equation \\(Ax = b\\). Let \\(x_0\\) be a solution to this equation.

Applying this transformation to \\(x_0\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   f(x_0) = Mx_0 + c\n   \\]\n\n3. **Using Transformed Vector**: Now, let’s use the transformed vector \\(f(x_0)\\) to solve for \\(x\\) in the equation \\(Ax = b\\).

    "Let's analyze the situation step by step:\n\n1. **Original System**: The original system of linear equations is \\(Ax = b\\).\n\n2. **Transformation Applied**: A transformation \\(f(x) = Mx + c\\) is applied to a solution vector \\(x_0\\).
