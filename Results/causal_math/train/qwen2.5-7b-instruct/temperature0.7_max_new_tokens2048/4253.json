The form of the current in the frequency domain shows that the change in frequency affects the real part of the pole locations in the denominator, but the overall structure of the current expression remains influenced by the entire impedance of the circuit, not just the frequency change alone.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: While the frequency change directly impacts the form of the current in the frequency domain, the precise output current \\(I(T)\\) at any time \\(T\\) will also depend on the transient response due to the initial conditions and the specific values of \\(R\\), \\(L\\), and \\(C\\).

Therefore, the precise form of \\(I(T)\\) will include contributions from both the original frequency \\(\\omega_1\\) and the new frequency \\(\\omega_2\\), but the dominant behavior will be governed by the new frequency \\(\\omega_2\\) as \\(T\\) increases.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the output current \\(I(T)\\) will not precisely reflect just the change in frequency \\(\\omega_2\\) by time \\(T\\); it will also incorporate the initial conditions and the values of the circuit parameters.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Circuit**: We have an RLC series circuit with input voltage \\(V(t) = V_0 \\cos(\\omega t)\\). The goal is to investigate how the output current \\(I(t)\\) changes when the frequency of the input voltage changes from \\(\\omega_1\\) to \\(\\omega_2\\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform and Frequency Response**: The Laplace transform can be used to analyze the behavior of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems like RLC circuits. For a sinusoidal input, the system's response is characterized by its frequency response. The output current \\(I(t)\\) can be found using the transfer function of the circuit, which relates the Laplace transforms of the input and output voltages.\n\n3. **Transfer Function for RLC Series Circuit**: The transfer function \\(H(s)\\) for an RLC series circuit is given by:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 + \\frac{s}{RC} + \\frac{1}{LC}}\n   \\]\n   where \\(s = j\\omega\\) for sinusoidal analysis.\n\n4. **Frequency Change Analysis**: When the input frequency changes from \\(\\omega_1\\) to \\(\\omega_2\\), the transfer function \\(H(j\\omega)\\) will change accordingly. This means that the system's behavior (i.e., the output current \\(I(t)\\)) will change as well.\n\n5. **Output Current Dependence on Frequency**: The output current \\(I(t)\\) will depend on both the input voltage and the circuit parameters (R, L, C). Specifically, the amplitude and phase of \\(I(t)\\) will change based on the new frequency \\(\\omega_2\\). However, the exact form of the current will also depend on the initial conditions and the transition time from \\(\\omega_1\\) to \\(\\omega_2\\).\n\n6. **Precision of Output Current**: The output current \\(I(T)\\) at any time \\(T\\) after the frequency change will reflect not only the change in frequency but also the transient behavior due to the transition from \\(\\omega_1\\) to \\(\\omega_2\\). The transient behavior includes the initial conditions and the time constant of the circuit.\n\nGiven these points, the output current \\(I(T)\\) will not precisely reflect just the change in frequency \\(\\omega_2\\) by time \\(T\\); it will include the transient effects due to the change in frequency.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
