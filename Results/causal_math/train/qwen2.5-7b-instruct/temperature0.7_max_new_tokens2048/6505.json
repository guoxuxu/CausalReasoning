    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Original System Definition:**\n   The system is defined by the integral transformation:\n   \\[\n   y(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} e^{As}(t-s)X(s) ds\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(A\\) is a constant matrix and \\(X(s)\\) is the input function.\n\n2. **Modified Input Function:**\n   The input function \\(X(t)\\) is modified using the transformation:\n   \\[\n   g(X) = e^{Bt}X(t)\n   \\]\n   This transformation is applied only at \\(t=0\\).\n\n3. **Impact of Transformation at \\(t=0\\):**\n   At \\(t=0\\), the modified input function becomes:\n   \\[\n   g(X)(0) = e^{B \\cdot 0}X(0) = X(0)\n   \\]\n   However, this transformation is only applied at \\(t=0\\).
