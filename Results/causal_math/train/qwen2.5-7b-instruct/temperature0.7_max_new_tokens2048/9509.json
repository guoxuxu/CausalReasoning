    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **System Description**: The system is governed by the differential equation \\(\\dot{x} = Dx\\), where \\(D\\) is a diagonalizable matrix.

This equality holds true if \\(M = P\\) or \\(M = P e^{\\Lambda T} P^{-1}\\), which implies that \\(M\\) must be a similarity transformation of \\(P\\).\n\nSince the problem does not specify that \\(M\\) is a similarity transformation of \\(P\\), generally, the two solutions will not be the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
