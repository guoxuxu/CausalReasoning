    "To determine if the final state \\( z(T) \\) will be independent of \\( \\omega \\), we need to analyze the effects of the transformations applied to \\( z(t) \\).\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The function \\( z(t) \\) satisfies the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N\n   \\]\n   where \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are complex constants.\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( f(z) \\)**: Applying the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{i\\omega t}z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{i\\omega t}z) = i\\omega e^{i\\omega t}z + e^{i\\omega t}\\frac{dz}{dt}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{i\\omega t}z) = i\\omega e^{i\\omega t}z + e^{i\\omega t}(Mz + N)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{i\\omega t}z) = (M + i\\omega)e^{i\\omega t}z + N\n   \\]\n   This shows that the transformed function \\( e^{i\\omega t}z \\) also satisfies a similar differential equation with modified parameters.\n\n3. **Intervention by \\( g(z) \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), the intervention is made by applying \\( g(z) = e^{-i\\omega t}z \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-i\\omega t}z) = -i\\omega e^{-i\\omega t}z + e^{-i\\omega t}\\frac{dz}{dt}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-i\\omega t}z) = -i\\omega e^{-i\\omega t}z + e^{-i\\omega t}(Mz + N)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-i\\omega t}z) = (M - i\\omega)e^{-i\\omega t}z + N\n   \\]\n   This again modifies the parameters of the differential equation but does not eliminate \\( \\omega \\).\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**: To find \\( z(T) \\), where \\( T > t_1 \\), we solve the differential equation for \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz + N\n   \\]\n   The general solution to this differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{Mt} \\left( C + \\int_0^t e^{-Ms} N \\, ds \\right)\n   \\]\n   where \\( C \\) is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n5. **Effect of Transformations**: The transformations \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) do not change the underlying dynamics described by \\( M \\) and \\( N \\). They only modify the form of \\( z(t) \\) temporarily. However, these modifications do not affect the long-term behavior of \\( z(t) \\) as described by the original differential equation.\n\nTherefore, the final state \\( z(T) \\) will depend on \\( M \\) and \\( N \\), but not on \\( \\omega \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
