    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation Analysis**:\n   - The given differential equation is \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = i\\omega z\\).\n   - This is a first-order linear differential equation with the solution \\(z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t}\\), where \\(A\\) is a constant determined by the initial condition.\n\n2. **Initial Condition**:\n   - At \\(t=0\\), we have \\(z(0) = A\\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Definition**:\n   - The Fourier Transform \\(F(z)(\\omega)\\) is defined as \\(F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t}z(t)dt\\).\n\n4. **Applying the Fourier Transform to \\(z(t)\\)**:\n   - For \\(z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t}\\), the Fourier Transform becomes:\n     \\[\n     F(z)(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega' t} (A e^{i\\omega t}) dt = A \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - \\omega') t} dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral is the definition of the Dirac delta function, \\(\\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\\). Therefore,\n     \\[\n     F(z)(\\omega') = 2\\pi A \\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\n     \\]\n\n5. **Initial Condition and Fourier Transform**:\n   - If we apply the Fourier Transform at \\(t=0\\), we get \\(z(0) = A\\).\n   - Applying the Fourier Transform to \\(z(0)\\) would give us:\n     \\[\n     F(z(0)) = F(A) = 2\\pi A \\delta(\\omega - 0)\n     \\]\n   - However, this interpretation is incorrect because \\(z(0)\\) is a constant and not a function of time.\n\n6. **Correct Interpretation**:\n   - The correct way to interpret the Fourier Transform of \\(z(t)\\) is that it reveals the frequency content of \\(z(t)\\).\n   - Since \\(z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t}\\) has only one frequency component \\(\\omega\\), the Fourier Transform will show a peak at \\(\\omega\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - The Fourier Transform \\(F(z)(\\omega)\\) will indeed accurately reflect the original frequency component \\(\\omega\\) of \\(z(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
