This function evolves over time with the constant angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( h(z) \\)**: The transformation \\( h(z) = z^2 \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\). This means that at any given time \\( t \\), the function becomes \\( z(t) = (e^{i\\omega t})^2 = e^{i2\\omega t} \\).\n\n3. **Intervention \\( j(z) \\)**: At time \\( t = T_1 \\), a new transformation \\( j(z) = z^3 \\) is introduced. This means that from \\( t = T_1 \\) onwards, the function is transformed to \\( z(t) = (z(t))^3 \\).\n\n4. **Endpoint Analysis**: We need to determine if the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > T_1 \\) depends only on \\( \\omega \\) and not on the earlier applied transformation \\( h(z) \\).\n\nTo analyze this, let's consider the evolution of \\( z(t) \\):\n\n- For \\( t \\leq T_1 \\):\n  - The function is \\( z(t) = e^{i2\\omega t} \\).\n  - At \\( t = T_1 \\), the function becomes \\( z(T_1) = e^{i2\\omega T_1} \\).\n\n- For \\( t > T_1 \\):\n  - The function is now transformed by \\( j(z) \\), so \\( z(t) = (z(t))^3 \\).\n  - Starting from \\( t = T_1 \\), we have:\n    \\[\n    z(T_1 + \\Delta t) = \\left(e^{i2\\omega T_1}\\right)^3 = e^{i6\\omega T_1}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    z(T_1 + 2\\Delta t) = \\left(e^{i6\\omega T_1}\\right)^3 = e^{i18\\omega T_1}\n    \\]\n    - Generally, for any \\( \\Delta t \\):\n      \\[\n      z(T_1 + n\\Delta t) = \\left(e^{i6\\omega T_1}\\right)^{3^n} = e^{i6\\omega T_1 \\cdot 3^n}\n      \\]\n\n- To find \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > T_1 \\):\n  - Let \\( T = T_1 + \\tau \\), where \\( \\tau \\geq 0 \\).\n  - Then:\n    \\[\n    z(T) = z(T_1 + \\tau) = \\left(e^{i6\\omega T_1}\\right)^{3^\\tau} = e^{i6\\omega T_1 \\cdot 3^\\tau}\n    \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > T_1 \\) depends on both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( T_1 \\), which is influenced by the earlier transformation \\( h(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > T_1 \\) does not depend only on \\( \\omega \\) and not on the earlier applied transformation.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
