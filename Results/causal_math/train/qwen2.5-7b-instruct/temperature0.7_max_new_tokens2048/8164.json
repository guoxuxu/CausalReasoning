It assumes no external heat sources initially.\n\n2. **Initial Condition with External Heat Source**: The problem states that an external heat source modifies the initial temperature distribution according to \\( f(x) = e^{-ax} \\). This implies that at \\( t=0 \\), the initial condition for the temperature is \\( T(x,0) = e^{-ax} \\).\n\n3. **Observing \\( T(x,t) \\)**: When we observe the temperature profile \\( T(x,t) \\) at a particular time \\( t \\), it will be influenced by both the initial condition and the heat diffusion process.
