    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation**: The original differential equation for the circuit is \\(L \\frac{dI}{dt} + RI = V(t)\\).\n\n2. **Transformation**: We apply a transformation \\(g(I) = I + ct\\), where \\(c\\) is a constant.

To find how this affects the original equation, we need to express \\(\\frac{dI}{dt}\\) in terms of \\(\\frac{dg}{dt}\\).\n\n3. **Differentiation**: Since \\(g = I + ct\\), differentiating both sides with respect to \\(t\\) gives \\(\\frac{dg}{dt} = \\frac{dI}{dt} + c\\).
