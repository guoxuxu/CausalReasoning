This represents a complex exponential function with time \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Transformation \\( T_1 \\)**: The transformation \\( T_1(z) = e^z \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\). However, since \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) and \\( e^{it} \\) is already in exponential form, applying \\( T_1 \\) would result in:\n   \\[\n   T_1(e^{it}) = e^{e^{it}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transformation \\( T_2 \\)**: The transformation \\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\). Applying \\( T_2 \\) to \\( z(t) \\) results in:\n   \\[\n   T_2(e^{it}) = (e^{it})^2 = e^{2it}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**: The question asks if the final state of \\( z(T) \\) depends only on the original function \\( e^{it} \\) and not on the transformation \\( T_1 \\) or \\( T_2 \\).\n\n   - If \\( T_1 \\) is applied at some time \\( t_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     z(t_1) = e^{it_1} \\rightarrow T_1(e^{it_1}) = e^{e^{it_1}}\n     \\]\n     If this transformed value is then used to find \\( z(T) \\), it will be:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{e^{it_1}}\n     \\]\n     This final state depends on both \\( t_1 \\) and the original function \\( e^{it} \\).\n\n   - If \\( T_2 \\) is applied at some time \\( t_1 \\):\n     \\[\n     z(t_1) = e^{it_1} \\rightarrow T_2(e^{it_1}) = e^{2it_1}\n     \\]\n     If this transformed value is then used to find \\( z(T) \\), it will be:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{2it_1}\n     \\]\n     This final state also depends on \\( t_1 \\) and the original function \\( e^{it} \\).\n\nIn both cases, the final state of \\( z(T) \\) depends on the specific time \\( t_1 \\) when the transformation is applied. Therefore, the final state does depend on the transformation applied.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is given as \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\). This represents a point on the unit circle in the complex plane, moving counterclockwise with angular velocity 1 radian per unit time.\n\n2. **Transformation \\( T_1 \\)**: \\( T_1(z) = e^z \\). Applying this transformation to \\( z(t) \\) would change the phase and magnitude of \\( z(t) \\).\n\n3. **Transformation \\( T_2 \\)**: \\( T_2(z) = z^2 \\). Applying this transformation to \\( z(t) \\) would square the argument of \\( z(t) \\) while keeping the magnitude squared.\n\n4. **Applying \\( T_2 \\) at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: If \\( T_2 \\) is applied at time \\( t_1 \\), then the function becomes \\( z(t_1) = e^{it_1} \\). Applying \\( T_2 \\) gives \\( z(t_1)^2 = (e^{it_1})^2 = e^{2it_1} \\).\n\n5. **Final State at Time \\( T \\)**: The final state at time \\( T \\) after applying \\( T_2 \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) is \\( z(T) = e^{i(T - t_1)} \\cdot e^{2it_1} = e^{i(T + t_1)} \\).\n\n6. **Independence from \\( T_1 \\)**: Since \\( T_1 \\) does not affect the final state directly (it's not applied at \\( t_1 \\)), we can consider its influence separately. However, if we were to apply \\( T_1 \\) at some point, it would change the initial condition but the subsequent application of \\( T_2 \\) at \\( t_1 \\) would still lead us to \\( e^{i(T + t_1)} \\) because \\( T_1 \\)'s effect is already integrated into the initial condition.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on the original function \\( e^{it} \\) and the time \\( t_1 \\) when \\( T_2 \\) is applied. It does not depend on whether \\( T_1 \\) was applied or not, as long as \\( T_1 \\) is not applied at \\( t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
