    "To determine whether the final state \\( u(x, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the original PDE and not on the convolution operation, let's reason through the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State and PDE**: The initial state is given by \\( u(x, t) \\). The system evolves according to the partial differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (A u) = 0\n   \\]\n   where \\( A \\) is a constant vector field.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform \\( F(u) = \\hat{u}(k, t) \\) converts the spatial domain function \\( u(x, t) \\) into its frequency domain representation \\( \\hat{u}(k, t) \\).\n\n3. **Convolution Operation**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a convolution with a function \\( g(x) \\) is applied to the state \\( u(x, t) \\). This operation modifies the state from \\( u(x, t) \\) to \\( u(x, t_1) * g(x) \\), where \\( * \\) denotes convolution.\n\n4. **Post-Convolution Evolution**: After the convolution at \\( t_1 \\), the modified state \\( u(x, t_1) * g(x) \\) continues to evolve according to the same PDE:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial (u * g)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (A (u * g)) = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final State Analysis**: To determine if the final state \\( u(x, T) \\) depends only on the original PDE and not on the convolution, we need to consider the properties of the convolution operation and the PDE.\n\n   - **Linearity of Convolution and PDE**: Both convolution and the PDE are linear operations. The convolution operation can be considered a linear transformation applied to the state at \\( t_1 \\).\n   - **Superposition Principle**: Since both operations (convolution and PDE evolution) are linear, the solution to the PDE after the convolution can be seen as a superposition of the original solution and the effect of the convolution.\n   - **Effect of Convolution**: The convolution operation introduces a new term that affects the state at \\( t_1 \\). However, once this modification is incorporated, the subsequent evolution of the state follows the same PDE.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The final state \\( u(x, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend on the convolution operation applied at \\( t_1 \\). This is because the convolution modifies the state at \\( t_1 \\), which then evolves according to the original PDE.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial System**: The given PDE is \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (A u) = 0\\). This describes how the state \\(u\\) evolves over time \\(t\\) under the influence of the vector field \\(A\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\(F(u) = \\hat{u}(k, t)\\) converts the spatial domain representation \\(u(x, t)\\) into its frequency domain representation \\(\\hat{u}(k, t)\\). The PDE in the frequency domain becomes simpler due to the properties of the Fourier transform.\n\n3. **Convolution Operation**: At time \\(t_1\\), a convolution with a function \\(g(x)\\) is applied to \\(u(x, t)\\). Convolution can be represented as:\n   \\[\n   u'(x, t) = (u * g)(x, t)\n   \\]\n   This operation modifies the state \\(u(x, t)\\) at time \\(t_1\\).\n\n4. **Continued Evolution**: After the convolution at \\(t_1\\), the system continues to evolve according to the same PDE. However, the initial condition at \\(t_1\\) is now different due to the convolution.\n\n5. **Effect on Final State**: To determine if the final state \\(u(x, T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) depends only on the original PDE and not on the convolution, we need to consider how the convolution affects the subsequent evolution of the system.\n\n6. **Independence Check**: The convolution operation at \\(t_1\\) introduces a new initial condition that influences the solution of the PDE from \\(t_1\\) onward. Therefore, the final state \\(u(x, T)\\) will indeed depend on the convolution because it changes the initial condition at \\(t_1\\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the final state \\(u(x, T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) will depend on both the original PDE and the convolution applied at \\(t_1\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
