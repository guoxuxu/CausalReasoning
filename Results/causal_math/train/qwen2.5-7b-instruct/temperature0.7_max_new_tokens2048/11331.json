This changes the output to:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = (K' * x)(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K'(t-\\tau) x(\\tau) d\\tau = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{A(t-\\tau)}K(t-\\tau) x(\\tau) d\\tau\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = e^{At} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-A\\tau} K(t-\\tau) x(\\tau) d\\tau = e^{At} z(t)\n   \\]\n   So, the new output is:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = e^{At} z(t)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Modification 2**: An additional modification is introduced at time \\( t_1 \\) such that the new kernel becomes \\( K''(t) = e^{Bt}K(t) \\).
