    "To determine if the steady-state current \\(I(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) depends solely on the initial \\(R\\) and \\(C\\), ignoring the inductor's properties, let's analyze the system step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Initial System\nThe initial system consists of a capacitor \\(C\\), a resistor \\(R\\), and a sinusoidal voltage source \\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i \\omega t}\\). The impedance of these components can be expressed as:\n- Capacitor: \\(Z_C = \\frac{1}{i \\omega C} = -i \\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\)\n- Resistor: \\(Z_R = R\\)\n\nThe total impedance \\(Z_{total}\\) of the series combination is:\n\\[ Z_{total} = R + Z_C = R - i \\frac{1}{\\omega C} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Steady-State Current Before Introducing the Inductor\nThe steady-state current \\(I(t)\\) can be found using Ohm's law in the frequency domain:\n\\[ I(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{Z_{total}} = \\frac{V_0 e^{i \\omega t}}{R - i \\frac{1}{\\omega C}} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Introduce the Inductor\nAt time \\(t_1\\), an inductor \\(L\\) is introduced into the circuit. The new total impedance becomes:\n- Inductor: \\(Z_L = i \\omega L\\)\n\nThe new total impedance \\(Z'_{total}\\) is:\n\\[ Z'_{total} = R + Z_C + Z_L = R - i \\frac{1}{\\omega C} + i \\omega L \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the New Steady-State Current\nAfter the introduction of the inductor, the new steady-state current \\(I'(t)\\) is:\n\\[ I'(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{Z'_{total}} = \\frac{V_0 e^{i \\omega t}}{R - i \\frac{1}{\\omega C} + i \\omega L} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Dependence on the Inductor\nThe expression for \\(I'(t)\\) now includes the term \\(i \\omega L\\), which was not present in the original expression for \\(I(t)\\). This means that the presence of the inductor \\(L\\) affects the steady-state current \\(I'(t)\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the introduction of the inductor \\(L\\) changes the total impedance and thus affects the steady-state current \\(I'(t)\\), the steady-state current \\(I(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) cannot depend solely on the initial \\(R\\) and \\(C\\). The inductor's properties must be taken into account.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
