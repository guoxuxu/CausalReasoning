    "To determine if the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the initial differential equation and not on \\( k \\) or \\( \\lambda \\), we need to analyze the effects of both transformations \\( g(z) \\) and \\( h(z) \\) on the function \\( z(t) \\).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Initial Differential Equation\nThe given differential equation is:\n\\[ \\frac{dz}{dt} = iz \\]\n\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation. The solution to this equation can be found by separation of variables or using the integrating factor method. The general solution is:\n\\[ z(t) = Ce^{it} \\]\nwhere \\( C \\) is a complex constant determined by the initial condition.\n\n### Step 2: Apply Transformation \\( g(z) \\)\nThe transformation \\( g(z) = e^{kt}z \\) modifies the function \\( z(t) \\) as follows:\n\\[ g(z(t)) = e^{kt}z(t) = e^{kt}Ce^{it} = Ce^{(k+i)t} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Apply Transformation \\( h(z) \\)\nThe transformation \\( h(z) = e^{\\lambda t}z \\) further modifies the function \\( z(t) \\) as follows:\n\\[ h(g(z(t))) = e^{\\lambda t}g(z(t)) = e^{\\lambda t}Ce^{(k+i)t} = Ce^{(\\lambda + k + i)t} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Endpoint \\( z(T) \\)\nThe endpoint \\( z(T) \\) after applying both transformations is:\n\\[ z(T) = Ce^{(\\lambda + k + i)T} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Dependence on \\( k \\) and \\( \\lambda \\)\nFrom the expression above, it is clear that the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( k \\) and \\( \\lambda \\). Specifically, the exponent includes both \\( k \\) and \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) explicitly depends on both \\( k \\) and \\( \\lambda \\), it does not depend only on the initial differential equation.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
