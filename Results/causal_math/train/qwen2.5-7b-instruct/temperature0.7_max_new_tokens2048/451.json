The goal is to compute the contour integral of \\( F \\) over some contour in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Contour Integral Basics**: For a single variable function \\( f(z) \\), the contour integral around a closed path \\( C \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\oint_C f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i \\sum \\text{Res}(f, p_i)\n   \\]\n   where the sum is over all poles \\( p_i \\) enclosed by \\( C \\), and \\(\\text{Res}(f, p_i)\\) is the residue at each pole \\( p_i \\).\n\n3. **Multi-Variable Function**: In the case of a multi-variable function \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\), the concept of residues and poles is more complex. However, the fundamental idea remains similar: the value of the integral depends on the behavior of the function near singularities (poles).\n\n4. **Effect of Re-positioning Contour**: If we intentionally reposition part of the contour to enclose an additional pole, we are changing the set of poles enclosed by the contour. This directly affects the residues that contribute to the integral.\n\n5. **Change in Integral Value**: Since the residues change when new poles are enclosed, the value of the contour integral will also change. This is because the integral is sensitive to the poles inside the contour, and adding or removing poles changes the contribution from these poles.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, repositioning the contour to enclose an additional pole will indeed change the result of the contour integral of \\( F(z_1, z_2) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
