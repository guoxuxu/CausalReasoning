    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition and Transformation:**\n   - The initial condition is \\( z_0 \\).\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), we apply the transformation \\( g(z) = Cz \\) to \\( z_0 \\).

    "To determine if the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) will be notably changed when the initial condition \\( z_0 \\) is transformed by \\( g(z) \\) compared to when it remains \\( z_0 \\), let's analyze the given functions and their implications step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Condition Transformation**:\n   - The original initial condition is \\( z_0 \\).\n   - When \\( g(z) = Cz \\) is applied to \\( z_0 \\), the new initial condition becomes \\( g(z_0) = Cz_0 \\).\n\n2. **Trajectory Without Transformation**:\n   - The trajectory of \\( z(t) \\) starting from \\( z_0 \\) is given by \\( z(t) = e^{At}z_0 \\).\n\n3. **Trajectory With Transformation**:\n   - If the transformation \\( g(z) \\) is applied, the new initial condition is \\( Cz_0 \\).
