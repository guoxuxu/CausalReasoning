This is modeled by the function \\( T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + H(t)S \\), where \\( H(t) \\) is the Heaviside step function that is 0 for \\( t < 0 \\) and 1 for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\n3. **Equilibrium Temperature**:\n   At equilibrium, the temperature \\( T \\) remains constant over time. Therefore, \\( \\frac{dT}{dt} = 0 \\). Substituting this into the differential equation gives:\n   \\[\n   0 = -k(T - (T_{base} + S))\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   T = T_{base} + S\n   \\]\n\n4. **Observation of Equilibrium Temperature**:\n   The observed equilibrium temperature \\( T_{eq} \\) is equal to \\( T_{base} + S \\). However, we do not know the value of \\( S \\).\n\n5. **Deduction of \\( T_{base} \\)**:\n   Since \\( T_{eq} = T_{base} + S \\) and we do not have the value of \\( S \\), we cannot directly solve for \\( T_{base} \\) without additional information about \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce the original environmental temperature \\( T_{base} \\) without knowing the constant shift \\( S \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can deduce the original environmental temperature \\( T_{base} \\) from the equilibrium temperature \\( T_{eq} \\) without knowing \\( S \\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Differential Equation:**\n   The given differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dT}{dt} = -k(T - T_{env})\n   \\]\n   This describes how the temperature \\( T \\) changes over time due to the difference between \\( T \\) and the environmental temperature \\( T_{env} \\).\n\n2. **Effect of the Sudden Shift:**\n   The environmental temperature \\( T_{env}(t) \\) changes suddenly at \\( t = 0 \\) from some initial value to \\( T_{base} + S \\). This is modeled as:\n   \\[\n   T_{env}(t) = T_{base} + H(t)S\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( H(t) \\) is the Heaviside step function, which is 0 for \\( t < 0 \\) and 1 for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\n3. **Equilibrium Condition:**\n   At equilibrium, the rate of change of temperature \\( \\frac{dT}{dt} \\) is zero:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dT_{eq}}{dt} = 0\n   \\]\n   Substituting into the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   0 = -k(T_{eq} - T_{env}(t))\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   T_{eq} = T_{env}(t)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine \\( T_{env}(t) \\) at Equilibrium:**\n   Since \\( T_{env}(t) \\) is constant at equilibrium (for \\( t > 0 \\)), we have:\n   \\[\n   T_{eq} = T_{base} + S\n   \\]\n\n5. **Isolate \\( T_{base} \\):**\n   To find \\( T_{base} \\), we need to isolate it in the above equation:\n   \\[\n   T_{base} = T_{eq} - S\n   \\]\n   However, we do not know \\( S \\), so we cannot directly solve for \\( T_{base} \\) without additional information about \\( S \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   Without knowing \\( S \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( T_{base} \\) from \\( T_{eq} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
