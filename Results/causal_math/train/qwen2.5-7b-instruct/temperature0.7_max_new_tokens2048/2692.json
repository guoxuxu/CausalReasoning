Mathematically, if \\( u \\) is the original velocity field, then \\( u' = T(u) \\).\n   - Since rotations preserve the norm of vectors, the magnitude of \\( u' \\) will be the same as \\( u \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Other Transformations (Transformation \\( S \\))**:\n   - If \\( S \\) is a non-rotational transformation like scaling or shearing, it would change the magnitude of \\( u \\). For example, if \\( S \\) scales \\( u \\) by a factor \\( k \\), then \\( u' = S(u) \\) would have a different magnitude than \\( u \\).\n\n4. **Determining the Transformations**:\n   - Given \\( u' \\), if the magnitude of \\( u' \\) is the same as \\( u \\), we cannot distinguish between a pure rotation and other transformations that might also preserve the magnitude.
