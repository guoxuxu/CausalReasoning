    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have \\( z(t) = \\int_0^t e^{As}x(s) ds \\), which means \\( z(t) \\) is determined by the integral of \\( x(s) \\) from 0 to \\( t \\), scaled by \\( e^{As} \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Before Intervention**: Before any intervention, the system evolves according to the dynamics governed by \\( A \\).
