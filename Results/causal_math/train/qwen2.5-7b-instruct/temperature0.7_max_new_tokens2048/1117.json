The new integral transformation using \\( z'(t) \\) is:\n   \\[ Z'(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z'(t) dt \\]\n   Since \\( z'(t) = z(t) \\) for \\( t > 0 \\), we can split the integral into two parts:\n   \\[ Z'(s) = \\int_0^0 e^{-st} z'(t) dt + \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\]\n\n4. The first part of the integral from 0 to 0 is 0, so we have:\n   \\[ Z'(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\]\n\n5. However, due to the modification at \\( t = 0 \\), we need to consider the value of \\( z'(t) \\) specifically at \\( t = 0 \\):\n   \\[ Z'(s) = \\int_0^0 e^{-st} \\alpha z(0) dt + \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt \\]\n   The first term simplifies to:\n   \\[ \\alpha z(0) \\int_0^0 e^{-st} dt = 0 \\]\n\n6. Therefore, the modified integral transformation becomes:\n   \\[ Z'(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z(t) dt = Z(s) \\]\n\n7. But this is not the full story because we need to consider the contribution at \\( t = 0 \\) more carefully.

The key point is that the integral transformation \\( Z(s) \\) does not include the value at \\( t = 0 \\) in its definition, so the transformation itself does not change. However, the initial condition or boundary value at \\( t = 0 \\) affects the overall behavior of the function, but not the integral transformation itself.\n\n9.
