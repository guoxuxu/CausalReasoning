    "To determine if the temperature distribution at time \\( T \\) depends only on \\( k \\) and the original heat source \\( h(x, t) \\), and not on the new source \\( j(x, t) \\), we need to analyze how the introduction of \\( j(x, t) \\) affects the solution to the heat equation.\n\n1. **Original Heat Equation**: The original heat equation with just the heat source \\( h(x, t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   u_t = k \\Delta u + h(x, t)\n   \\]\n   This equation describes how the temperature \\( u \\) changes over time due to both conduction and the external heat source \\( h(x, t) \\).\n\n2. **Introduction of New Heat Source**: When a new heat source \\( j(x, t) \\) is introduced at time \\( t_1 \\), the heat equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   u_t = k \\Delta u + h(x, t) + \\delta(t - t_1) j(x, t_1)\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\delta(t - t_1) \\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\( t_1 \\), indicating that the new source \\( j(x, t_1) \\) is active only at time \\( t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Solution Dependence**: The presence of the Dirac delta function \\( \\delta(t - t_1) \\) means that the solution \\( u(x, t) \\) at any time \\( t > t_1 \\) will be influenced by \\( j(x, t_1) \\). Specifically, the solution \\( u(x, t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) will include a term that accounts for the impulse provided by \\( j(x, t_1) \\).\n\n4. **Temperature Distribution at Time \\( T \\)**: At time \\( T \\) (where \\( T > t_1 \\)), the temperature distribution \\( u(x, T) \\) will reflect the effects of both the original heat source \\( h(x, t) \\) and the new heat source \\( j(x, t_1) \\). This is because the impulse from \\( j(x, t_1) \\) propagates through the material over time, contributing to the temperature distribution at later times.\n\nGiven this analysis, the temperature distribution at time \\( T \\) does indeed depend on the new heat source \\( j(x, t) \\) as well as the original heat source \\( h(x, t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
