    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The heat equation is given by \\( u_t = \\kappa \\Delta u \\).

This means that the temperature at the boundary evolves according to this function.\n\n3. **Steady-State Solution**: A steady-state solution satisfies \\( \\kappa \\Delta u = 0 \\). For a given set of boundary conditions, there exists a unique steady-state solution \\( u_{ss}(x) \\).\n\n4. **Comparison at Time T**: We need to compare the temperature distribution \\( u(x,T) \\) after evolving for time \\( T \\) with the steady-state solution \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) under the same boundary conditions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n- **Evolution of Boundary Condition**: The boundary condition \\( h(t,x) = e^{\\lambda t} g(x) \\) introduces a time-dependent term. This means that the boundary temperature is not constant but grows exponentially with time.\n  \n- **Heat Equation Dynamics**: The heat equation \\( u_t = \\kappa \\Delta u \\) describes how temperature evolves over time due to diffusion. With the initial condition being \\( h(t,x) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), the temperature distribution will evolve differently compared to starting from a steady-state condition.\n\n- **Steady-State vs. Transient Response**: The steady-state solution \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) is the solution when the system has reached a state where the temperature no longer changes with time. However, the initial condition here is not a steady-state but a time-varying function \\( h(t,x) \\).\n\n- **Different Initial Conditions**: Starting from \\( h(t,x) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) means the system will have a transient response that eventually approaches a steady-state. The initial condition \\( h(t,x) \\) does not directly correspond to a steady-state solution; it represents a perturbation from a potential initial state.\n\nGiven these points, the temperature distribution \\( u(x,T) \\) at a later time \\( T \\) will generally not be the same as the steady-state solution \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) under the same boundary conditions. The initial condition \\( h(t,x) \\) introduces a dynamic behavior that the steady-state solution does not capture.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition and Steady-State Solution**:\n   - The steady-state solution \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) of the heat equation \\( u_t = \\kappa \\Delta u \\) under the given boundary conditions \\( h(t,x) \\) satisfies \\( \\kappa \\Delta u_{ss} = 0 \\). This means that \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) is a solution that does not change with time, i.e., \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) is independent of \\( t \\).\n\n2. **Boundary Conditions**:\n   - At \\( t = 0 \\), the boundary condition is given by \\( h(t,x) = e^{\\lambda t}g(x) \\). This implies that initially, the temperature distribution at the boundaries is given by \\( g(x) \\) scaled by \\( e^{\\lambda \\cdot 0} = 1 \\), so it matches the initial condition for the steady-state solution \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Evolution of Temperature Distribution**:\n   - If we start from the initial condition \\( u(x,0) = u_{ss}(x) \\), the solution to the heat equation will evolve over time while respecting the given boundary conditions \\( h(t,x) \\). However, since \\( h(t,x) = e^{\\lambda t}g(x) \\) is applied at \\( t = 0 \\) and remains unchanged after that, the boundary conditions do not change with time.\n\n4. **Comparison with Steady-State Solution**:\n   - For the steady-state solution \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) under the same boundary conditions, it would remain constant over time because the Laplacian of \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) is zero, and there is no time dependence.\n   - In contrast, when starting from \\( u(x,0) = u_{ss}(x) \\) and evolving according to the heat equation with the given boundary conditions, the temperature distribution \\( u(x,t) \\) will generally not remain exactly equal to \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) for \\( t > 0 \\). The term \\( e^{\\lambda t}g(x) \\) will affect the evolution of \\( u(x,t) \\), causing it to deviate from the steady-state solution.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, the temperature distribution \\( u(x,t) \\) at a later time \\( T \\) will not be the same as the steady-state solution \\( u_{ss}(x) \\) unless \\( \\lambda = 0 \\), which is a special case where the boundary condition does not change over time.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
