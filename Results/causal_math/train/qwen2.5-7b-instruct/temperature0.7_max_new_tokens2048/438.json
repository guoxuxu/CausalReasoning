For example, if \\(D = I\\) (the identity matrix), \\(x_0\\) would be directly obtainable. However, any other diagonal matrix \\(D\\) would scale the components differently, leading to different possible \\(x_0\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without knowing \\(D\\), we cannot uniquely determine \\(x_0\\) from \\(x(T)\\) because there are infinitely many possibilities depending on the unknown scaling factors in \\(D\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

This transformation scales each component of \\(x(t)\\) independently.\n\n3. **State at Time T**: At time \\(t = T\\), we know the state of the system after the transformation, which we'll call \\(y(T) = g(x(T)) = Dx(T)\\).\n\n4. **Reversing the Transformation**: To determine if we can uniquely recover \\(x_0\\) (the initial state), we need to reverse the transformation \\(g(x)\\).
