    "To determine whether the final response \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on the natural frequency \\( k \\) and not on \\( \\omega \\) or \\( \\omega' \\), let's analyze the given system and the interventions step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Homogeneous System\nThe homogeneous equation governing the displacement \\( x \\) is:\n\\[ \\ddot{x} + kx = 0 \\]\nThis is a simple harmonic oscillator with the general solution:\n\\[ x_h(t) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{k}t) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t) \\]\nwhere \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are constants determined by initial conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Introduce the Forcing Function \\( f(t) \\)\nWhen the forcing function \\( f(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is applied, the particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation can be assumed as:\n\\[ x_p(t) = C e^{i\\omega t} \\]\nSubstituting into the differential equation:\n\\[ -\\omega^2 C e^{i\\omega t} + k C e^{i\\omega t} = e^{i\\omega t} \\]\n\\[ C(k - \\omega^2) = 1 \\]\nThus,\n\\[ C = \\frac{1}{k - \\omega^2} \\]\nSo, the particular solution is:\n\\[ x_p(t) = \\frac{e^{i\\omega t}}{k - \\omega^2} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Combine Solutions for Initial Response\nThe total response to the forcing function \\( f(t) \\) is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n\\[ x(t) = x_h(t) + x_p(t) \\]\n\\[ x(t) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{k}t) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t) + \\frac{e^{i\\omega t}}{k - \\omega^2} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Introduce the Second Forcing Function \\( g(t) \\)\nAt time \\( t_1 \\), another forcing function \\( g(t) = e^{-i\\omega' t} \\) is introduced. The particular solution to the new forcing term is:\n\\[ x_{p2}(t) = D e^{-i\\omega' t} \\]\nSubstituting into the differential equation:\n\\[ -(-\\omega')^2 D e^{-i\\omega' t} + k D e^{-i\\omega' t} = e^{-i\\omega' t} \\]\n\\[ D(k - (\\omega')^2) = 1 \\]\nThus,\n\\[ D = \\frac{1}{k - (\\omega')^2} \\]\nSo, the particular solution due to \\( g(t) \\) is:\n\\[ x_{p2}(t) = \\frac{e^{-i\\omega' t}}{k - (\\omega')^2} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Final Response After Intervention\nThe total response after the intervention at \\( t_1 \\) is the sum of the previous response and the new particular solution:\n\\[ x(t) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{k}t) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t) + \\frac{e^{i\\omega t}}{k - \\omega^2} + \\frac{e^{-i\\omega' t}}{k - (\\omega')^2} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate Response at Time \\( T > t_1 \\)\nFor \\( T > t_1 \\), the response will include all terms from the initial forcing function and the additional forcing function introduced at \\( t_1 \\). However, the natural frequency \\( k \\) governs the behavior of the cosine and sine terms, which will dominate the long-term behavior of the system.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe final response \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend on the natural frequency \\( k \\) because it determines the oscillatory behavior of the system. The terms involving \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\omega' \\) represent transient effects that decay over time and do not affect the long-term oscillatory behavior dominated by \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System Dynamics**:\n   - The system is described by the differential equation \\( \\ddot{x} = -kx \\). This is a simple harmonic oscillator with a natural frequency \\( \\sqrt{k} \\).\n   - The natural response (without any external forcing) is oscillatory with frequency \\( \\sqrt{k} \\).\n\n2. **Initial Forcing Function**:\n   - A forcing function \\( f(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is applied. This represents a sinusoidal input with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n   - The response to such a forcing function can be found using Fourier analysis or Laplace transforms, but it will generally include components with frequencies \\( \\omega \\) and \\( -\\omega \\).\n\n3. **Intervention with Another Forcing Function**:\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), an additional forcing function \\( g(t) = e^{-i\\omega' t} \\) is introduced.\n   - This introduces a new frequency component \\( -\\omega' \\) into the system's response.\n\n4. **Response Analysis**:\n   - The response to the initial forcing function \\( f(t) \\) will persist as long as the forcing continues, and it will also continue to influence the system even after the forcing stops.\n   - The new forcing function \\( g(t) \\) will add a component to the system's response with frequency \\( -\\omega' \\).\n\n5. **Final Response at Time \\( T \\)**:\n   - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the response will include contributions from both the original forcing and the new forcing.\n   - The response will have multiple frequency components: \\( \\omega \\), \\( -\\omega \\), \\( -\\omega' \\), and potentially others depending on the interaction of these forces.\n\n6. **Dependency on Frequencies**:\n   - The final response \\( x(T) \\) will depend on all the frequencies involved, including \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\omega' \\), due to the superposition principle.\n   - The natural frequency \\( k \\) will still dominate the overall behavior but does not eliminate the dependency on the introduced frequencies.\n\nGiven this analysis, the final response \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend on \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\omega' \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
