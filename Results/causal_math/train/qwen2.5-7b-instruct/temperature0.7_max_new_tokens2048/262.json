At time \\( T \\), this becomes:\n   \\[ z(T) = e^{AT}x + e^{BT}y \\]\n\n2. **Uniqueness of Solution**: For \\( z(T) \\) to uniquely determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), the system must be well-posed with a unique solution for any given \\( z(T) \\).\n\n3. **Dependence on Matrices and Vectors**: The matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) play a crucial role. If \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are distinct (i.e., they have different eigenvalues or structures), then the terms \\( e^{AT} \\) and \\( e^{BT} \\) will generally behave differently over time. This difference could potentially allow us to isolate \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n4. **Linear Independence**: For \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to be uniquely determined, the vectors \\( e^{AT}x \\) and \\( e^{BT}y \\) need to be linearly independent.

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The function given is \\( z(t) = e^{At}x + e^{Bt}y \\).\n2.

To determine if \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can be uniquely identified from \\( z(T) \\), we need to consider the nature of the exponential matrix functions \\( e^{AT} \\) and \\( e^{BT} \\).\n\n4. For \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to be uniquely identifiable:\n   - The equations must provide enough information to solve for both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n   - This implies that the system of equations derived from \\( z(T) \\) should have a unique solution for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n5.
