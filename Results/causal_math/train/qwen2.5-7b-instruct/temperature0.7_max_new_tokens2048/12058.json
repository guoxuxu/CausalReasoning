    "To address this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The given function is \\( z(t) = e^{(a+ib)t} \\). This function represents a complex exponential with a real part \\( ae^{at} \\) and an imaginary part \\( be^{ibt} \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation \\( T(z) \\)**: The first transformation is an integral over the interval from 0 to \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{(a+ib)s} ds.\n   \\]\n   To solve this integral, we use the fact that:\n   \\[\n   \\int e^{(a+ib)s} ds = \\frac{e^{(a+ib)s}}{a+ib}.\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(a+ib)s}}{a+ib} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{e^{(a+ib)t} - 1}{a+ib}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Additional Transformation \\( U(z) \\)**: At a specific time \\( t_1 \\), the function undergoes an additional transformation:\n   \\[\n   U(z) = z(t_1) e^{-ct_1} = e^{(a+ib)t_1} e^{-ct_1} = e^{(a-c+ib)t_1}.\n   \\]\n   This introduces a new factor \\( e^{-(c-a)t_1} \\) into the function.\n\n4. **Second Integral Transformation \\( T(z) \\) after \\( U(z) \\)**: Now, we need to consider the integral of the transformed function from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   T(U(z)) = \\int_{t_1}^t e^{(a+ib)s} ds.\n   \\]\n   Using the same method as before, we get:\n   \\[\n   T(U(z)) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(a+ib)s}}{a+ib} \\right]_{t_1}^t = \\frac{e^{(a+ib)t} - e^{(a+ib)t_1}}{a+ib}.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Integrated Value**: The final integrated value \\( T(z)(T) \\) includes both transformations.
