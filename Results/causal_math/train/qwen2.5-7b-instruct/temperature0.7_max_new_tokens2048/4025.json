    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have the original system output \\( z(t) \\) governed by the relationship \\( Z(s) = H(s)X(s) \\), where:\n   - \\( Z(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\),\n   - \\( H(s) \\) is the transfer function of the system,\n   - \\( X(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of the input \\( x(t) \\).\n\n2. **Control Intervention**: When a control intervention \\( u(t) \\) is introduced, the new output \\( y(t) \\) is described by \\( Y(s) = H(s)(X(s) + U(s)) \\), where:\n   - \\( Y(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( y(t) \\),\n   - \\( U(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of the control input \\( u(t) \\).\n\n3. **Without Control Intervention**: If there is no control intervention, then \\( U(s) = 0 \\).
