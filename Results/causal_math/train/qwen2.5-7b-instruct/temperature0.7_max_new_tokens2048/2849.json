    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**:\n   - The given equation \\(u_t = ku_{xx}\\) is the heat equation, which describes how the temperature \\(u(x,t)\\) changes over time \\(t\\) due to diffusion (heat conduction) with a diffusion coefficient \\(k\\).\n\n2. **Initial Condition**:\n   - The initial condition is given as \\(u(x,0) = e^{-ax^2}\\).

This represents a Gaussian distribution centered at \\( x = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Heat Equation**: The heat equation \\( u_t = ku_{xx} \\) describes how the temperature evolves over time due to diffusion. It's a linear PDE, meaning that if we start with an initial condition and let it evolve, the solution will depend only on the initial condition and the diffusion coefficient \\( k \\).\n\n3. **Solution Form**: For the heat equation with the given initial condition, the solution can be expressed as a convolution of the initial condition with the fundamental solution (Green's function) of the heat equation.
