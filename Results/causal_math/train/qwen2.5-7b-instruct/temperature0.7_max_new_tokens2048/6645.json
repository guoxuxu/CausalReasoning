    "To determine whether applying \\( p(z) \\) before the integral transformation \\( I[f(z)] \\) will result in the same outcome as applying \\( p(z) \\) after the transformation, we need to analyze both scenarios.\n\n### Scenario 1: Applying \\( p(z) \\) Before the Transformation\n\nGiven:\n\\[ I[p(z)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (z^2 + 1) e^{-z^2} dz \\]\n\nWe can split this into two integrals:\n\\[ I[p(z)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z^2 e^{-z^2} dz + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-z^2} dz \\]\n\nThe first integral is:\n\\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z^2 e^{-z^2} dz = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\]\nThis result comes from the known Gaussian integral properties.\n\nThe second integral is:\n\\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-z^2} dz = \\sqrt{\\pi} \\]\n\nAdding these results together:\n\\[ I[p(z)] = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} + \\sqrt{\\pi} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\]\n\n### Scenario 2: Applying \\( p(z) \\) After the Transformation\n\nGiven:\n\\[ I[f(z)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(z) e^{-z^2} dz \\]\n\nThen applying \\( p(z) \\) to the result of the transformation:\n\\[ p(I[f(z)]) = (I[f(z)])^2 + 1 \\]\n\nSince \\( I[f(z)] \\) is a complex number (as it involves integrating over all real numbers with a complex function), let's denote \\( I[f(z)] = A + Bi \\) where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are real numbers. Then:\n\\[ p(I[f(z)]) = (A + Bi)^2 + 1 = A^2 - B^2 + 2ABi + 1 \\]\n\nThis expression is generally different from \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (z^2 + 1) e^{-z^2} dz \\), which is a real number.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe application of \\( p(z) \\) before the transformation \\( I[f(z)] \\) does not yield the same result as applying \\( p(z) \\) after the transformation \\( I[f(z)] \\). The former results in a specific numerical value, while the latter results in a more complex expression involving the integral itself.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
