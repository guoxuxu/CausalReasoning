  "Explanation": "Given the nature of the exponential function and the lack of external influence, the natural evolution of \\\\( z(t) \\\\) from \\\\( z(0) = 1 \\\\) inherently traces out the arc \\\\( e^{iωt} \\\\), arriving at the same position at time T as if \\\\( z(T) = e^{iωT} \\\\) had been applied directly.",
