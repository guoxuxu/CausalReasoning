    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant and \\( z \\) is a complex variable.\n\n2. **Transformation Using Inverse Laplace Transform**: We apply the inverse Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\) to \\( f(z) \\). However, the inverse Laplace transform typically deals with functions of \\( s \\) (the complex frequency variable), not \\( z \\). Assuming \\( z \\) is related to \\( s \\) in some way, let's consider the function \\( F(s) = e^{As} \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform of \\( F(s) \\)**: The inverse Laplace transform of \\( F(s) = e^{As} \\) is \\( \\delta(t - A) \\), where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function. This represents an impulse response at time \\( t = A \\).\n\n4. **Intervention at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), there is an intervention that modifies \\( z \\) to \\( z' = z + B \\). Since \\( z \\) is transformed into \\( z' \\), we need to see how this affects the function and its inverse Laplace transform.\n\n5. **Effect of Intervention**: The modification \\( z' = z + B \\) implies that the argument of the exponential function changes from \\( Az \\) to \\( A(z + B) \\). Thus, the new function after the intervention is \\( f'(z) = e^{A(z + B)} = e^{Az} \\cdot e^{AB} \\).\n\n6. **Inverse Laplace Transform After Intervention**: Applying the inverse Laplace transform to the modified function \\( f'(z) = e^{Az} \\cdot e^{AB} \\), we get \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1}[f'(z)] = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}[e^{Az}] \\cdot e^{AB} \\). Given that the inverse Laplace transform of \\( e^{Az} \\) is \\( \\delta(t - A) \\), the inverse Laplace transform of \\( f'(z) \\) would be \\( \\delta(t - A) \\cdot e^{AB} \\).\n\n7. **Dependency Analysis**: The resulting function \\( y(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) will include the term \\( e^{AB} \\), which depends on both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Therefore, \\( y(t) \\) is not solely dependent on \\( A \\); it also depends on \\( B \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Transformation**:\n   - The initial function is \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\).\n   - Applying the inverse Laplace transform to this function gives us \\( y(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{e^{Az}\\} \\).\n\n2. **Adjustment at Time \\( t_1 \\)**:\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention modifies \\( z \\) from its original value to \\( z' = z + B \\).\n   - This implies that after \\( t_1 \\), the function now becomes \\( f(z') = e^{A(z+B)} = e^{Az} \\cdot e^{AB} \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform Post-Intervention**:\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\( e^{Az} \\cdot e^{AB} \\) is \\( y(t) = e^{At} \\cdot e^{AB} \\).\n   - Note that \\( e^{AB} \\) is a constant with respect to \\( t \\).\n\n4. **Analysis of \\( y(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\)**:\n   - For \\( t > t_1 \\), the expression for \\( y(t) \\) remains \\( y(t) = e^{At} \\cdot e^{AB} \\).\n   - Since \\( e^{AB} \\) is a constant (not dependent on \\( t \\)), it does not change the dependence of \\( y(t) \\) on \\( A \\).

    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with the function \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\).\n\n2. **Transformation via Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\) is used to convert \\( f(z) \\) from the z-domain to the time domain. For \\( f(z) = e^{Az} \\), the inverse Laplace transform gives us:\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{1}{s - A}\n   \\]\n   where \\( s \\) is the complex frequency variable in the Laplace domain.\n\n3. **Adjustment at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), we modify \\( z \\) to \\( z' = z + B \\).
