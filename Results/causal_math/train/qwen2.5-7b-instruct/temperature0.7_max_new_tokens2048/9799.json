We need to determine if this modification affects \\( g(z) \\) at a later time \\( T > t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Behavior of \\( g(z) \\) after Transformation**:\n   - Before the transformation, \\( g(z) \\) is defined with respect to the original \\( z \\).\n   - After the transformation at \\( t_1 \\), \\( z \\) changes to \\( z^2 \\). Therefore, we need to consider \\( g(z^2) \\) from \\( t_1 \\) onwards.\n\n4. **Form of \\( g(z^2) \\)**:\n   The new function \\( g(z^2) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   g(z^2) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (z^2)^s \\, ds = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z^{2s} \\, ds\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison with Original \\( g(z) \\)**:\n   - The original \\( g(z) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z^s \\, ds\n     \\]\n   - The transformed \\( g(z^2) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     g(z^2) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z^{2s} \\, ds\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   Since the integrals defining \\( g(z) \\) and \\( g(z^2) \\) are different due to the exponentiation of \\( s \\) in the integrand, the function \\( g(z) \\) will indeed change when \\( z \\) is modified to \\( z^2 \\) at time \\( t_1 \\). Therefore, the final form of \\( g(z) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) will be affected by the early transformation of \\( z \\).\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function \\( g(z) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z^s \\, ds\n   \\]\n   This integral converges under certain conditions on \\( s \\) and \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Transformation at Time \\( t_1 \\)**: At time \\( t_1 \\), \\( z \\) is transformed to \\( z^2 \\). This means that for all \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the value of \\( z \\) used in the function \\( g(z) \\) is \\( z^2 \\).\n\n3. **Effect on \\( g(z) \\) after \\( t_1 \\)**: We need to determine if the final form of \\( g(z) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) remains unaffected by the early transformation of \\( z \\).\n\n4. **Revised Function After Transformation**:\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\), \\( g(z) \\) is computed using \\( z \\).\n   - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), \\( g(z) \\) is computed using \\( z^2 \\).\n\n5. **Analyzing the Integral**:\n   - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\), the integral becomes:\n     \\[\n     g(z^2) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} (z^2)^s \\, ds = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z^{2s} \\, ds\n     \\]\n   - This is different from the original function \\( g(z) \\), which would be:\n     \\[\n     g(z) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} z^s \\, ds\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the integrand changes from \\( z^s \\) to \\( z^{2s} \\) after \\( t_1 \\), the form of \\( g(z) \\) at \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed be affected by the transformation of \\( z \\) to \\( z^2 \\) at \\( t_1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
