Therefore, the temperature distribution at time \\(t = T\\) after applying the transformation will not be identical to the situation without applying the transformation, but it will be a scaled and shifted version of the original distribution.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the temperature distribution \\(u(x, t)\\) at time \\(t = T\\) will be identical after applying the transformation \\(g(x) = ax + b\\), we need to consider how this transformation affects the heat equation and the initial conditions.\n\n1. **Original Heat Equation**: The original heat equation is given by:\n   \\[\n   u_t = ku_{xx}\n   \\]\n   where \\(k\\) is the thermal diffusivity constant.\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: Applying the transformation \\(g(x) = ax + b\\) to the spatial coordinate \\(x\\) means that the new spatial variable is \\(y = g(x) = ax + b\\). To maintain consistency with the original variables, we need to express the temperature function \\(u(x, t)\\) in terms of the new variable \\(y\\).\n\n3. **Chain Rule for Partial Derivatives**: Using the chain rule, we can express the partial derivatives in terms of \\(y\\):\n   \\[\n   u_x = \\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dy} \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx} = a \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   u_{xx} = \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(a \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right) = a \\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx} = a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Transformed Heat Equation**: Substituting these into the original heat equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   u_t = k u_{xx} \\implies u_t = k (a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2})\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   u_t = k a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Initial Condition Transformation**: The initial condition \\(u(x, 0)\\) transforms to \\(u(y, 0) = u(ax + b, 0)\\).\n\n6. **Solution Invariance**: The transformed heat equation \\(u_t = k a^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\) with the transformed initial condition \\(u(y, 0) = u(ax + b, 0)\\) describes the same physical process but in a different coordinate system. The solution to this transformed equation is equivalent to the solution of the original heat equation up to a change of variables. Specifically, the temperature distribution at any later time \\(t = T\\) will be the same as if the original equation had been solved with the transformed initial condition.\n\nGiven this analysis, the temperature distribution \\(u(x, t)\\) at time \\(t = T\\) will indeed be identical to the situation without applying \\(g(x)\\), provided we account for the transformed initial condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```\n\nThe reason for \"No\" is that while the form of the heat equation remains similar under the transformation, the initial condition changes, and thus the solutions are not identical unless the initial condition itself is transformed accordingly. However, the essence of the question seems to imply a direct comparison without considering the transformed initial condition, which would make the answer \"Yes\" if we only consider the form of the equation."
