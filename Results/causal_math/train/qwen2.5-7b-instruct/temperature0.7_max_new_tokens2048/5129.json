    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Fourier Transform and Differential Equation**: The Fourier transform of a function \\(x(t)\\) is given by \\(X(ω) = ℱ\\{x(t)\\}\\). For a linear system described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{y} = Ky\\), where \\(K\\) is a constant matrix, we need to understand how the Fourier transform behaves with respect to differentiation.\n\n2. **Differentiation in Frequency Domain**: In the frequency domain, the Fourier transform of the derivative of a function is related to the original Fourier transform by multiplication with \\(iω\\). Specifically, if \\(Y(ω) = ℱ\\{y(t)\\}\\), then the Fourier transform of \\(\\dot{y}(t)\\) is \\(iωY(ω)\\).\n\n3. **Applying the Differential Equation**: Given the differential equation \\(\\dot{y} = Ky\\), taking the Fourier transform on both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   iωY(ω) = K Y(ω)\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   Y(ω) = \\frac{iω}{K} Y(ω)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Analysis**: The equation \\(iωI = K\\) suggests that \\(K\\) must have eigenvalues equal to \\(iω\\) for each corresponding frequency. However, since \\(K\\) is a constant matrix, it cannot change based on frequency \\(\\omega\\). Therefore, for different frequencies \\(\\omega\\), \\(Y(ω)\\) would generally not simply be a differential transformation of \\(X(ω)\\) under the influence of \\(K\\), unless \\(K\\) is specifically designed to match the form \\(iωI\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: In general, \\(Y(ω)\\) will not be the differential transformation of \\(X(ω)\\) under the influence of \\(K\\) because the relationship between \\(X(ω)\\) and \\(Y(ω)\\) involves more than just a simple multiplication by \\(iω\\). Instead, \\(Y(ω)\\) will depend on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \\(K\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Fourier Transform Application**: The input signal \\(x(t)\\) is transformed into the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform to get \\(X(ω)\\):\n   \\[\n   X(ω) = ℱ\\{x(t)\\}\n   \\]\n\n2. **System Characterization**: The system is described by the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{y} = Ky\n   \\]\n   where \\(K\\) is a constant matrix.\n\n3. **Output in Frequency Domain**: The output \\(y(t)\\) is transformed to the frequency domain as:\n   \\[\n   Y(ω) = ℱ\\{y(t)\\}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Frequency Response**: For linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, the Fourier transform of the output \\(Y(ω)\\) can be expressed in terms of the Fourier transform of the input \\(X(ω)\\) and the frequency response \\(H(ω)\\) of the system. Specifically, for a first-order differential equation like this, the frequency response \\(H(ω)\\) is typically related to the eigenvalues of the matrix \\(K\\).\n\n5. **Differential Transformation Under Influence of \\(K\\)**: The relationship between \\(X(ω)\\) and \\(Y(ω)\\) for such an LTI system would generally be:\n   \\[\n   Y(ω) = H(ω)X(ω)\n   \\]\n   where \\(H(ω)\\) is the frequency response function that depends on the eigenvalues of \\(K\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the above, \\(Y(ω)\\) at any frequency \\(\\omega\\) will indeed be the differential transformation of \\(X(ω)\\) under the influence of \\(K\\), since it is directly proportional to \\(X(ω)\\) with the proportionality factor being the frequency response \\(H(ω)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Fourier Transform of Input Signal**: We start with an input signal \\(x(t)\\) and apply the Fourier Transform to it, resulting in \\(X(ω) = ℱ\\{x(t)\\}\\).\n\n2. **System Characterization**: The system is described by the differential equation \\(\\dot{y} = Ky\\), where \\(K\\) is a constant matrix, and \\(y(t)\\) is the output.\n\n3. **Output in Frequency Domain**: When we take the Fourier Transform of both sides of the differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   ℱ\\{\\dot{y}(t)\\} = ℱ\\{Ky(t)\\}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Properties of Fourier Transform**: The Fourier Transform of the derivative \\(\\dot{y}(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   ℱ\\{\\dot{y}(t)\\} = jωY(ω)\n   \\]\n   And the Fourier Transform of \\(Ky(t)\\) is simply:\n   \\[\n   ℱ\\{Ky(t)\\} = KY(ω)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Equating the Transforms**: Therefore, equating the Fourier Transforms, we have:\n   \\[\n   jωY(ω) = K Y(ω)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solving for \\(Y(ω)\\)**: Rearranging the equation gives:\n   \\[\n   Y(ω) (jω - K) = 0\n   \\]\n   This implies that either \\(Y(ω) = 0\\) or \\(jω = K\\).
