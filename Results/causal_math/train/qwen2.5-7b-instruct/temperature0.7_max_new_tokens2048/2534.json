It needs to be reformulated in a way that it fits the Laplace transform framework.\n\n3. **Reformulating \\(g(z)\\)**: To apply the Laplace transform, we need to consider \\(g(z)\\) in terms of a time domain function. If we let \\(z = x + iy\\) (where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers and \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit), then:\n   \\[\n   g(z) = e^{\\lambda(x+iy)} = e^{\\lambda x}e^{i\\lambda y}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Laplace Transform of \\(g(z)\\)**: For a function involving both real and imaginary parts, the Laplace transform would typically involve a complex frequency shift.
