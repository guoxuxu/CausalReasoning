  "Ground Truth": "yes",
  "Explanation": "The transformation \\( T(z) \\) directly scales the magnitude and rotates the phase of the trajectory. Since the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\lambda t} \\) is periodic, applying \\( T(z) \\) still preserves the natural evolution under \\( z'(t) = (e^{i\\lambda t})^k \\).
