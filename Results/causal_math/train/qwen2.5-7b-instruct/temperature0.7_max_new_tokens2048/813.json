Specifically, \\( \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt}x(t)\\right\\} = i\\omega X(\\omega) \\). For our differential equation, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{\\frac{d}{dt}x(t) + ax(t)\\right\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{0\\} = 0\n   \\]\n   Substituting the Fourier transform properties, we get:\n   \\[\n   i\\omega X(\\omega) + aX(\\omega) = 0\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   X(\\omega) (i\\omega + a) = 0\n   \\]\n   Since \\( X(\\omega) \\neq 0 \\) (assuming non-trivial \\( x(t) \\)), we have:\n   \\[\n   i\\omega + a = 0 \\implies \\omega = -ia\n   \\]\n   However, this is not directly useful for our purposes here. Instead, we should note that the Fourier transform of the evolved signal \\( x(t) = x(0)e^{-at} \\) will be:\n   \\[\n   X(\\omega, t) = X(\\omega) e^{-iat}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Comparison at Time T**: At time \\( t = T \\), the Fourier transform of the signal \\( x(T) = x(0)e^{-aT} \\) will be:\n   \\[\n   X(\\omega, T) = X(\\omega) e^{-iaT}\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Fourier transform at \\( t = T \\) is a phase-shifted version of the initial Fourier transform \\( X(\\omega) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The Fourier transform \\( X(\\omega) \\) at \\( t = T \\) does not represent the initial transformation accurately because it has undergone a phase shift due to the time evolution governed by the differential equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
