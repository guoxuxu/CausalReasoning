This describes how \\(X_t\\) evolves over time.\n\n2. **Transformation of \\(X_t\\)**: We have \\(Z_t = e^{\\lambda t}X_t\\). This means \\(Z_t\\) is a transformed version of \\(X_t\\).\n\n3. **Derivative of \\(Z_t\\)**: To understand how \\(Z_t\\) changes over time, we need to find \\(dZ_t\\). Using Ito's lemma:\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = d(e^{\\lambda t}X_t) = \\lambda e^{\\lambda t}X_t dt + e^{\\lambda t}dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 \\cdot (e^{\\lambda t})^2 dt\n   \\]\n   Since the term involving the second derivative is zero, we get:\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = \\lambda e^{\\lambda t}X_t dt + e^{\\lambda t}dX_t\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\):\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = \\lambda e^{\\lambda t}X_t dt + e^{\\lambda t}(\\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = (\\lambda e^{\\lambda t}X_t + \\mu e^{\\lambda t}X_t) dt + \\sigma e^{\\lambda t}X_t dW_t\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = e^{\\lambda t}( \\lambda X_t + \\mu X_t ) dt + \\sigma e^{\\lambda t}X_t dW_t\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   dZ_t = e^{\\lambda t}( \\lambda + \\mu ) X_t dt + \\sigma e^{\\lambda t}X_t dW_t\n   \\]\n\n4. **Implication for \\(Z_t\\)**: The above expression shows that \\(Z_t\\) follows a similar SDE but with modified drift and volatility terms. Importantly, the initial condition \\(X_0\\) directly translates to \\(Z_0 = e^{\\lambda \\cdot 0}X_0 = X_0\\).\n\n5. **Inference of \\(X_0\\)**: Knowing the trajectory of \\(Z_t\\) does not allow us to directly infer \\(X_0\\) without knowing \\(\\lambda\\). Even though we know \\(Z_0 = X_0\\), the value of \\(Z_0\\) alone is insufficient to determine \\(X_0\\) because it could be scaled by any \\(\\lambda\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the given SDE**: The SDE for \\(X_t\\) is \\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\). This describes how \\(X_t\\) changes over time due to both deterministic (drift) and random (diffusion) factors.\n\n2. **Transformation of \\(X_t\\) to \\(Z_t\\)**: We have \\(Z_t = e^{\\lambda t} X_t\\). To understand how \\(Z_t\\) evolves, we need to apply Ito's lemma to find \\(dZ_t\\).\n\n3. **Applying Ito's Lemma**:\n   - Let \\(f(X_t, t) = e^{\\lambda t} X_t\\).\n   - Then, \\(df = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} dt + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_t} dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial X_t^2} (dX_t)^2\\).\n   - Calculating the partial derivatives:\n     - \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\lambda e^{\\lambda t} X_t\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_t} = e^{\\lambda t}\\)\n     - \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial X_t^2} = 0\\)\n   - Substituting these into Ito's lemma:\n     - \\(dZ_t = \\lambda e^{\\lambda t} X_t dt + e^{\\lambda t} dX_t + 0\\)\n     - Since \\(dX_t = \\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t\\):\n     - \\(dZ_t = \\lambda e^{\\lambda t} X_t dt + e^{\\lambda t} (\\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t)\\)\n     - Simplifying, we get:\n     - \\(dZ_t = e^{\\lambda t} (\\lambda X_t + \\mu X_t) dt + e^{\\lambda t} \\sigma X_t dW_t\\)\n     - \\(dZ_t = e^{\\lambda t} (\\lambda + \\mu) X_t dt + e^{\\lambda t} \\sigma X_t dW_t\\)\n\n4. **Analyzing the transformed SDE for \\(Z_t\\)**:\n   - The SDE for \\(Z_t\\) now has a drift term that includes \\(\\lambda\\), which means the drift term of \\(Z_t\\) depends on \\(\\lambda\\).\n   - Without knowing \\(\\lambda\\), it's impossible to directly extract the initial condition \\(X_0\\) from the trajectory of \\(Z_t\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Knowing only the trajectory of \\(Z_t\\) does not allow us to uniquely determine \\(X_0\\) because \\(\\lambda\\) affects the drift term in the transformed process.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
