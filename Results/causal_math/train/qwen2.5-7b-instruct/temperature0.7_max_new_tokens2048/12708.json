At \\( t = T \\):\n   \\[ z'(T) = e^{i (\\omega T + \\phi)} \\cdot z_0 \\]\n\n6. Comparing \\( z(T) \\) and \\( z'(T) \\):\n   - Without phase shift: \\( z(T) = e^{i \\omega T} \\cdot z_0 \\)\n   - With phase shift: \\( z'(T) = e^{i (\\omega T + \\phi)} \\cdot z_0 = e^{i \\omega T} \\cdot e^{i \\phi} \\cdot z_0 \\)\n\n7. Clearly, \\( z'(T) \\neq z(T) \\) unless \\( e^{i \\phi} = 1 \\), which means \\( \\phi = 0 \\) or \\( \\phi = 2\\pi k \\) for integer \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, adding an initial phase shift \\( \\phi \\) to \\( z_0 \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) will not result in the same \\( z(T) \\) regardless of the phase shift.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
