This means that if the contour \\( C \\) encloses the origin, the integral \\( \\int_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz \\) will not be zero due to the residue theorem.

Therefore, if \\(0\\) is inside the contour \\(C\\), the integral will not be zero due to the singularity.\n\n3. **Integral Calculation for \\( f(z) \\)**:\n   - If \\(0\\) is inside the contour \\(C\\), the integral \\(\\int_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz = 2\\pi i\\).\n   - If \\(0\\) is outside the contour \\(C\\), the integral \\(\\int_C \\frac{1}{z} \\, dz = 0\\).\n\n4. **Considering Interventions and Transformations**:\n   - The problem mentions transformations \\(f(z)\\) and \\(g(z)\\). Since only \\(f(z)\\) is provided, we assume \\(g(z)\\) is not relevant to the current discussion.\n   - The integral \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\) will give us information about the presence of the singularity at \\(0\\) within the contour \\(C\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the value of \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz\\):\n     - If \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz = 2\\pi i\\), it indicates that the contour \\(C\\) encloses the origin \\(0\\).\n     - If \\(\\int_C f(z) \\, dz = 0\\), it indicates that the contour \\(C\\) does not enclose the origin \\(0\\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, we can conclusively identify the presence or absence of the singularity at \\(0\\) based on the integral value. However, since only \\(f(z)\\) is considered and no other transformation \\(g(z)\\) is mentioned, we cannot distinguish between the application of \\(f(z)\\) and \\(g(z)\\) directly from the integral alone.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
