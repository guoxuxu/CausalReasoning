    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Equation**:\n   - The Laplace equation \\( \\nabla^2 \\phi = 0 \\) describes a potential function \\( \\phi \\) in a field. It is a second-order partial differential equation (PDE) that holds under steady-state conditions.\n\n2. **Transformation by \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\)**:\n   - Applying the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\) does not change the underlying Laplace equation because it is a conformal mapping in the complex plane. Conformal mappings preserve angles and do not alter the solutions to the Laplace equation in terms of the PDE itself. However, it can change the form of the boundary conditions or the specific solution depending on the region in the complex plane being mapped.\n\n3. **Intervention with \\( g(z) = e^{-iz} \\)**:\n   - The function \\( g(z) = e^{-iz} \\) is also a conformal mapping, similar to \\( f(z) \\). It is essentially a rotation and scaling in the complex plane.

Since both \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) are conformal mappings, they do not change the fundamental nature of the Laplace equation.

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Setup**: We start with Laplace's equation \\(\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0\\). This equation describes a potential function \\(\\phi\\) that is harmonic (i.e., its second derivatives sum to zero).\n\n2. **Transformation \\(f(z) = e^{iz}\\)**: The function \\(f(z) = e^{iz}\\) is a complex exponential function. Applying this transformation to the Laplace equation doesn't change the fact that the transformed function still needs to satisfy Laplace's equation. However, it changes the form of the solution from the original \\(\\phi(x, y)\\) to a new function involving \\(z\\).\n\n3. **Intervention \\(g(z) = e^{-iz}\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), we introduce another transformation \\(g(z) = e^{-iz}\\).

The solutions to Laplace's equation remain harmonic regardless of these transformations.
