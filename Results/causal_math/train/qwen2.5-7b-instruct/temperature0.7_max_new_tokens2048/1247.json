    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Laplace Equation**: The Laplace equation \\(\\nabla^2 u = 0\\) describes a potential \\(u(x, y)\\) that is harmonic. In two dimensions, this means that the second partial derivatives of \\(u\\) with respect to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) sum to zero.\n\n2. **Fourier Transformation**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\(u(x, y)\\) results in \\(U(k, y)\\), where \\(k\\) is the wavenumber and \\(y\\) is the spatial coordinate.

The potential \\(u(x, y)\\) satisfies this equation. Applying the Fourier transform in the x-direction, we obtain the transformed function \\(U(k, y)\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of Laplace Equation**: The Fourier transform of the Laplace equation \\(\\nabla^2 u = 0\\) results in an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for \\(U(k, y)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2 U}{dy^2} - k^2 U = 0.\n   \\]\n   This is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients, whose general solution is:\n   \\[\n   U(k, y) = A(k) e^{ky} + B(k) e^{-ky},\n   \\]\n   where \\(A(k)\\) and \\(B(k)\\) are constants that can be determined from initial or boundary conditions.\n\n3. **Initial Conditions**: Initially, the potential is \\(u_0(x)\\), which means the Fourier transform at \\(y=0\\) is \\(U(k, 0) = \\mathcal{F}\\{u_0(x)\\}(k)\\).\n\n4. **Intervention at \\(y = Y_1\\)**: If we modify \\(u(x, Y_1)\\) by some intervention, it changes the boundary condition at \\(y = Y_1\\).

Since the ODE is linear and homogeneous away from the boundary, the effect of the intervention at \\(y = Y_1\\) will propagate as a wave along the y-axis. However, the influence of the original boundary condition at \\(y = 0\\) will also be present.\n\n6. **Propagation of Changes**: The solution \\(U(k, y)\\) is a combination of exponential terms, each representing a wave propagating in both directions from the boundaries.
