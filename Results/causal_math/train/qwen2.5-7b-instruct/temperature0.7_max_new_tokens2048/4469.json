Specifically, the eigenvalues of \\( A + tB \\) will not directly correspond to those of \\( A \\) because \\( A \\) and \\( A + tB \\) are fundamentally different matrices, even though they share some properties due to the commutativity of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n5. **Final State Analysis**: At time \\( T \\), if we evaluate the characteristic polynomial of the matrix \\( A + TB \\), it will describe the eigenvalues of \\( A + TB \\), which are influenced by both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).
