    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: We start with \\( u(x, 0) \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: Applying the integral transformation \\( T(u) \\) gives us:\n   \\[\n   T(u) = \\int e^{ikx} u(x, 0) \\, dx\n   \\]\n   This transformation converts the spatial domain into the frequency domain (Fourier transform).\n\n3. **Evolution Equation**: The PDE \\( \\partial_t u = D \\partial_x^2 u \\) describes how \\( u(x, t) \\) evolves over time. This is the heat equation, which is linear and has solutions that can be expressed in terms of the initial condition.\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of the Heat Equation**: Taking the Fourier transform of both sides of the heat equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\partial_t \\hat{u}(k, t) = -D k^2 \\hat{u}(k, t)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\hat{u}(k, t) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( u(x, t) \\).\n\n5. **Solution in Frequency Domain**: The above ODE can be solved easily:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-D k^2 t}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\hat{u}(k, 0) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( u(x, 0) \\).\n\n6. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find \\( u(x, t) \\), we take the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   u(x, t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int e^{-ikx} \\hat{u}(k, t) \\, dk = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int e^{-ikx} \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-D k^2 t} \\, dk\n   \\]\n\n7. **Comparison**: Notice that the expression for \\( u(x, t) \\) obtained by evolving \\( u(x, 0) \\) directly and applying the Fourier transform to \\( u(x, 0) \\) and then evolving it back is exactly the same. This means that the process of transforming, evolving in the frequency domain, and then transforming back is equivalent to evolving directly in the spatial domain.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
