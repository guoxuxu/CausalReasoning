This is a standard heat equation, which models the spread of heat (or any diffusive quantity) in a medium.\n\n2. **Transformation Function**: The transformation \\(h(z) = \\int e^{-sD}z \\, ds\\) suggests that \\(z\\) is being modified by an exponential factor involving time.

    "Let's break down the problem to determine if we can reconstruct the initial vector \\(z_0\\) from observing \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\).\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE**: The given PDE is \\(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = D\\Delta z\\). This describes how the function \\(z(x,t)\\) changes over time due to diffusion, where \\(D\\) is the diffusion coefficient and \\(\\Delta\\) is the Laplacian operator. The solution to this PDE is well-known and can be expressed using the heat kernel (or fundamental solution of the diffusion equation).\n\n2. **Heat Kernel Solution**: The solution to the PDE can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(x,t) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} K_t(x-y) z_0(y) dy,\n   \\]\n   where \\(K_t(x)\\) is the heat kernel:\n   \\[\n   K_t(x) = \\frac{1}{(4\\pi Dt)^{n/2}} e^{-\\frac{|x|^2}{4Dt}}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Transformation Function**: The transformation function is defined as \\(h(z) = \\int e^{-sD} z ds\\).

The heat kernel \\(K_T(x)\\) is a known function, and the integral equation above suggests that \\(z(x,T)\\) is a convolution of \\(z_0\\) with \\(K_T(x)\\). Inverting such a convolution is possible using techniques from integral transforms (e.g., Fourier transform methods).\n\nGiven these steps, we can indeed reconstruct the initial condition \\(z_0\\) from the observation of \\(z(t)\\) at \\(t = T\\), provided we know the exact form of the heat kernel and apply appropriate inversion techniques.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
