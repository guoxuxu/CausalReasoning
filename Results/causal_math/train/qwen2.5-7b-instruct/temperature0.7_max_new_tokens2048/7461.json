The linear transformation is represented by a matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and the nonlinear function is \\\\( h(z) = z^2 + c \\\\), where \\\\( c \\\\) is a complex constant and \\\\( z \\\\) represents the state vector in a complex function space.\n\nIf the state vector \\\\( z_0 \\\\) is initially transformed by the matrix \\\\( M \\\\) and then the function \\\\( h(z) \\\\) is applied without further manipulation, will the final state at some time \\\\( t \\\\) be predictable solely based on \\\\( M \\\\) without knowledge of \\\\( h \\\\)?",
