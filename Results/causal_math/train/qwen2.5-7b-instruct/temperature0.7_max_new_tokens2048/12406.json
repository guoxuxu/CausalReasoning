    "To address this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the differential equation \\( \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = f(t) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Taking the Fourier transform of both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\left(\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}\\right) + \\mathcal{F}(y) = \\mathcal{F}(f(t))\n   \\]\n   Using properties of the Fourier transform, specifically that \\( \\mathcal{F}\\left(\\frac{d^n y}{dt^n}\\right) = (is)^n Y(s) \\), we can rewrite this as:\n   \\[\n   (s^2 Y(s)) - sy(0) - y'(0) + Y(s) = F(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( Y(s) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( y(t) \\) and \\( F(s) \\) is the Fourier transform of \\( f(t) \\).\n\n3. **Intervention Introduction**: Now, consider the introduction of a damping term \\( e^{-at} \\) to the function \\( f(t) \\). This means we are now dealing with the function \\( f(t)e^{-at} \\).\n\n4. **Effect on Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( f(t)e^{-at} \\) will be \\( F(s + a) \\). This is because the Fourier transform of \\( e^{-at}f(t) \\) is \\( F(s + a) \\).\n\n5. **New Equation**: Substituting \\( F(s + a) \\) into our transformed differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   (s^2 Y(s)) - sy(0) - y'(0) + Y(s) = F(s + a)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Comparison**: Comparing the new equation with the original one:\n   \\[\n   (s^2 Y(s)) - sy(0) - y'(0) + Y(s) = F(s + a)\n   \\]\n   to the original:\n   \\[\n   (s^2 Y(s)) - sy(0) - y'(0) + Y(s) = F(s)\n   \\]\n   we see that the only difference is in the right-hand side, which has changed from \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s + a) \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The introduction of the damping term \\( e^{-at} \\) changes the form of \\( F(s) \\) to \\( F(s + a) \\), but it does not directly affect the form of \\( Y(s) \\) in the equation \\( s^2Y(s) - sy(0) - y'(0) + Y(s) = F(s) \\). The structure of the equation remains the same; only the argument of \\( F(s) \\) changes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
