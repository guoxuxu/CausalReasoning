    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Wave Equation**: The given wave equation is a second-order partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how a wave propagates through space and time. It's a linear equation, which means it satisfies the principle of superposition.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform to the wave function \\(u(x,0)\\) converts the spatial domain information into frequency domain information. The Fourier transform of \\(u(x,0)\\) is denoted as \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\).\n\n3. **Solution Using Fourier Transform**: For the wave equation, if we take the Fourier transform with respect to \\(x\\), we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{u}}{\\partial t^2} - c^2 k^2 \\hat{u} = 0\n   \\]\n   This is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time \\(t\\). Its solution is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k,t) = A(k) \\cos(c k t) + B(k) \\sin(c k t)\n   \\]\n   where \\(A(k)\\) and \\(B(k)\\) are determined by the initial conditions.\n\n4. **Initial Conditions**: At \\(t=0\\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k,0) = A(k) = \\hat{u}(k,0)\n   \\]\n   This means the initial Fourier coefficients \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\) are directly related to the Fourier transform of the initial wave function \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\n5. **Reconstructing \\(u(x,0)\\)**: To find \\(u(x,0)\\), we need to inverse Fourier transform \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\):\n   \\[\n   u(x,0) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{\\hat{u}(k,0)\\}\n   \\]\n   This process is unique for a given \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\).\n\n6. **Time Evolution**: For \\(t > 0\\), the wave evolves according to the ODE solution. However, knowing \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\) at any later time \\(t\\) does not provide direct information about \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\) without the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\).\n\n7. **Uniqueness**: Given \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\) at any fixed \\(t > 0\\), we cannot uniquely determine \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\) without additional information such as initial or boundary conditions. This is because the evolution of the wave depends on both the initial conditions and the time parameter.\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, we conclude that we cannot uniquely determine the initial wave function \\(u(x,0)\\) from its Fourier transformed state \\(\\hat{u}(k, t)\\) without additional data.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

This function describes the shape of the wave at time \\(t=0\\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: Applying the Fourier transform to \\(u(x,0)\\) gives us \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\). The Fourier transform decomposes the initial wave into its frequency components. Each component corresponds to a particular wavelength and frequency.\n\n3. **Wave Equation Solution**: The wave equation \\(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\) describes how the wave evolves over time. The solution to this equation, given an initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\), can be expressed using the Fourier transform properties. Specifically, if we know \\(\\hat{u}(k,0)\\), we can reconstruct \\(u(x,t)\\) for any future time \\(t > 0\\) using the inverse Fourier transform.\n\n4. **Reconstruction of Initial Condition**: Given the Fourier transform \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\) at any time \\(t > 0\\), we can use the inverse Fourier transform to recover \\(u(x,t)\\). However, the key question is whether we can uniquely determine \\(u(x,0)\\) from \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\) alone.\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Inverse Fourier Transform**: The inverse Fourier transform is unique. If we have \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\) at any single time \\(t > 0\\), we can indeed recover \\(u(x,t)\\) by applying the inverse Fourier transform. But, the critical point here is that we need to consider the entire evolution of the wave from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t > 0\\).\n\n6. **Cauchy Problem and Uniqueness**: The wave equation is a well-posed Cauchy problem. For a unique solution, we typically need both the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\) and the initial velocity \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0)\\). Knowing only \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\) at a single time \\(t > 0\\) does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\(u(x,0)\\) because it does not account for the initial velocity.\n\nGiven these considerations, we cannot uniquely determine the initial wave function \\(u(x,0)\\) solely from its Fourier transformed state \\(\\hat{u}(k,t)\\) without additional data (such as the initial velocity \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(x,0)\\)).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
