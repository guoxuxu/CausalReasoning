    "To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial System Dynamics**: The initial system is described by the transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{sP + Q} \\). This represents a linear time-invariant (LTI) system with dynamics governed by the matrices \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\n2. **Feedback Introduction**: At time \\( t = 0 \\), a feedback matrix \\( K \\) is introduced, changing the system dynamics to \\( \\tilde{H}(s) = \\frac{1}{sP + Q + K} \\). This modification changes the poles of the system, affecting its behavior.\n\n3. **System Evolution**: After the introduction of \\( K \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), the system evolves under the new dynamics \\( \\tilde{H}(s) \\) without further intervention.

The state of the system at \\( t = 0^+ \\) (immediately after the introduction of \\( K \\)) is different from the state at \\( t = 0^- \\) (just before the introduction of \\( K \\)). This change in state leads to a different evolution of the system for \\( t > 0 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the initial conditions and thus the state of the system change immediately at \\( t = 0 \\) due to the introduction of \\( K \\), the output \\( y(t) \\) at any time \\( t > 0 \\), including \\( t = T \\), will differ between the two scenarios. Therefore, the output at \\( t = T \\) under \\( \\tilde{H}(s) \\) cannot be the same as if the system had continued under \\( H(s) \\) without the introduction of \\( K \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
