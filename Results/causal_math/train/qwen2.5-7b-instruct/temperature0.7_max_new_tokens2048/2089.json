    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Transformation**: The given transformation is \\( w = e^{az + b} \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are complex constants. This means that every point \\( z \\) in the complex plane is mapped to a new point \\( w \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation Definition**: The integral transformation we're considering is \\( \\int_C f(z) \\, dz \\), where \\( C \\) is a contour in the complex plane.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**: If we apply the transformation \\( w = e^{az + b} \\) to \\( f(z) \\), we get a new function \\( g(w) = f(e^{-b/a}w - b/a) \\). However, the integral itself involves \\( z \\), not \\( w \\).\n\n4. **Change of Variables in Integral**: To understand how the integral changes when we map \\( z \\) to \\( w \\), we need to use a change of variables. Let \\( w = e^{az + b} \\), then \\( dw = ae^{az+b}dz \\), or equivalently, \\( dz = \\frac{dw}{aw} \\).\n\n5. **Rewriting the Integral**: Substituting \\( w \\) and \\( dz \\) into the original integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\int_C f(z) \\, dz = \\int_{C'} f\\left(\\frac{\\log w - b}{a}\\right) \\frac{dw}{aw}\n   \\]\n   where \\( C' \\) is the image of \\( C \\) under the transformation \\( w = e^{az + b} \\).\n\n6. **Comparing Integrals**: The integral on the left side is the integral of \\( f(z) \\) over the original contour \\( C \\). The integral on the right side is the integral of \\( f \\) transformed by the inverse of the exponential function (i.e., \\( f \\) evaluated at points corresponding to \\( w \\)) over the transformed contour \\( C' \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The two integrals are not generally the same because the contours \\( C \\) and \\( C' \\) are different (unless \\( C \\) is such that it maps back onto itself under the transformation, which is not typically the case for arbitrary contours).\n\nTherefore, the result of the integral transformation is not the same as integrating \\( f(z) \\) transformed by \\( e^{az+b} \\) directly without applying the function first.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
