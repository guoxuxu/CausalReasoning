This transformation modifies the state of \\( z(t) \\) at each time \\( t \\). However, since it is a multiplicative factor that scales the entire complex number \\( z(t) \\), it does not affect the dynamics of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) themselves but rather scales their magnitudes.\n\n3. **Intervention by \\( h(z) \\)**: At a certain time \\( t_1 \\), an additional transformation \\( h(z) = e^{Dt}z \\) is introduced. This means that after time \\( t_1 \\), the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) is modified by the factor \\( e^{D(t-t_1)} \\).\n\n4. **Endpoint Analysis**: To determine if the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) (for \\( T > t_1 \\)) depends only on \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) and not on \\( C \\) or \\( D \\):\n\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\), the system evolves according to \\( \\dot{x} = Ax \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = By \\).\n   - At \\( t = t_1 \\), the system is scaled by \\( e^{Ct_1} \\), but this scaling is a one-time effect.\n   - From \\( t_1 \\) onwards, the system evolves according to \\( \\dot{x} = Ae^{(t-t_1)}x \\) and \\( \\dot{y} = Be^{(t-t_1)}y \\), but now additionally scaled by \\( e^{D(t-t_1)} \\).\n\n5. **Final State Calculation**:\n   - Before \\( t_1 \\): \\( z(t) = e^{At}z(0) \\)\n   - At \\( t_1 \\): \\( z(t_1) = e^{Ct_1}e^{At_1}z(0) \\)\n   - From \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\): \\( z(T) = e^{D(T-t_1)}e^{B(T-t_1)}e^{Ct_1}e^{At_1}z(0) \\)\n\nThe term \\( e^{Ct_1} \\) and \\( e^{D(T-t_1)} \\) are just multiplicative constants and do not influence the fundamental dynamics governed by \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).
