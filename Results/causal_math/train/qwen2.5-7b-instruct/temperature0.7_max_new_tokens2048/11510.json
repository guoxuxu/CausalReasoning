    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\)**:\n   - This is a complex exponential function that traces out a unit circle in the complex plane as \\( t \\) varies over time.\n   - The function is periodic with period \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**:\n   - The Laplace Transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is defined as \\( F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) dt \\).\n   - For \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), the Laplace Transform would be \\( F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{it} dt \\).\n\n3. **Computing the Laplace Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - \\( F(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(i-s)t} dt \\).\n   - This integral converges only if the real part of \\( s \\) (denoted as Re\\(s\\)) is greater than 1 (since \\( i-s \\) has a negative real part, making the exponential decay faster than the oscillation grows).\n   - The result of this integral is \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\) for Re\\(s\\) > 1.\n\n4. **Recovering \\( z(t) \\) from \\( F(s) \\)**:\n   - The inverse Laplace Transform of \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\) is indeed \\( e^{it} \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n   - However, the Laplace Transform and its inverse do not provide information about the behavior of the function for \\( t < 0 \\). The Laplace Transform is inherently causal, meaning it only considers future (or present) values, not past values.\n\n5. **Causal Interpretation**:\n   - Given only \\( F(s) \\), we cannot uniquely determine the behavior of \\( z(t) \\) for \\( t < 0 \\) because the Laplace Transform does not capture the history of the function.\n   - The function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) could have any arbitrary behavior for \\( t < 0 \\) as long as it matches the given \\( F(s) \\) for \\( t \\geq 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, without additional information about the function's behavior for \\( t < 0 \\), we cannot recover the exact function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To determine if we can recover the exact function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) from its Laplace Transform \\( F(s) \\), let's analyze the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\)**:\n   - This is a complex exponential function that describes a unit circle in the complex plane.\n   - It represents a sinusoidal oscillation with angular frequency 1.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\)**:\n   - The Laplace Transform of \\( e^{it} \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{it} e^{-st} dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{(i-s)t} dt\n     \\]\n   - Evaluating this integral, we get:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(i-s)t}}{i-s} \\right]_0^\\infty\n     \\]\n   - For \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\), the integral converges and we have:\n     \\[\n     F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Inversion of the Laplace Transform**:\n   - The inverse Laplace Transform of \\( F(s) = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s-i}\\right\\} = e^{it}\n     \\]\n   - This means that the Laplace Transform and its inverse correctly map back to the original function under the specified conditions.\n\n4. **Causality Consideration**:\n   - The Laplace Transform is defined for causal systems (where the input is zero for negative time).\n   - Given that \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) is a causal signal (no values for \\( t < 0 \\)), the Laplace Transform should uniquely determine the original function.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - If we know the Laplace Transform \\( F(s) \\) and it corresponds to a causal function, then we can indeed recover the exact function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
