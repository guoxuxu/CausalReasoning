    "To determine if the function \\( f'(T(z)) \\) maintains analyticity across the entire complex plane after the specified transformations, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Function and Analyticity**:\n   - The initial function \\( f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) \\) is analytic in a region if it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations.\n   - This means that \\( u_x = v_y \\) and \\( u_y = -v_x \\).\n\n2. **Transformation and Function Modification**:\n   - The transformation \\( T(z) = z^2 \\).\n   - The modified function is \\( f'(z) = f(z) + cz^3 \\), where \\( c \\) is a non-zero complex constant.\n\n3. **Applying the Transformation**:\n   - We need to find \\( f'(T(z)) \\).
