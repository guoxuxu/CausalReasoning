This means that the new value of \\( z \\) becomes \\( D(Cz(t_1)) = DCz(t_1) \\).\n\n4. Now, from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, the evolution of \\( z \\) continues according to the original function, but starting from the new value \\( DCz(t_1) \\).\n\n5. The expression for \\( z(t) \\) after the transformations would be:\n   - For \\( t < t_1 \\): \\( z(t) = e^{iAt}z_0 \\)\n   - For \\( t \\geq t_1 \\): \\( z(t) = e^{iA(t-t_1)}DCz(t_1) \\)\n\n6. To find \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\):\n   - \\( z(T) = e^{iA(T-t_1)}DCz(t_1) \\)\n   - Substituting \\( z(t_1) = e^{iAt_1}z_0 \\) into the equation:\n     \\( z(T) = e^{iA(T-t_1)}DCe^{iAt_1}z_0 \\)\n   - Simplifying the exponentials:\n     \\( z(T) = e^{iA(T-t_1+At_1)}DCz_0 \\)\n     \\( z(T) = e^{iAT}DCz_0 \\)\n\n7. The final expression for \\( z(T) \\) shows that it depends on \\( A \\), \\( D \\), \\( C \\), and \\( z_0 \\).\n\n8. However, the question specifically asks if the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends only on \\( A \\) and not on \\( C \\) or \\( D \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is no, because \\( z(T) \\) does depend on \\( C \\) and \\( D \\).\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
