Specifically, the presence of \\(M\\) means that the observed state \\(z(T)\\) will be scaled and possibly rotated differently compared to the case where no transformation is applied.\n\nHowever, the critical aspect is that the transformation \\(h(z)\\) changes the initial condition but does not change the form of the exponential evolution. Therefore, if we know the exact form of \\(z(T)\\) and compare it to both potential scenarios (with and without the transformation), we can infer whether the transformation was applied based on the observed \\(z(T)\\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, we can conclude that it is indeed possible to infer whether the transformation \\(h(z)\\) was applied at \\(t = 0\\) even without knowing the matrix \\(M\\), because the effect of the transformation on the initial condition will manifest in the observed state \\(z(T)\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
