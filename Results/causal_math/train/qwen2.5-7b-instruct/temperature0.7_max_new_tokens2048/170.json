    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have the Laplace transform equation for the system: \\( L\\{y(t)\\} = \\frac{Y(s)}{s - P} \\).\n\n2. The input function is \\( u(t) = e^{Dt} \\).

    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the given Laplace transform equation for the system:\n   \\[ L\\{y(t)\\} = \\frac{Y(s)}{s - P} \\]\n\n2.
