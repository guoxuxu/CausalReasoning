Let's assume this condition holds:\n   \\[\n   f(z) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(a-s)t}}{a-s} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n   \\]\n   Evaluate the limits:\n   \\[\n   f(z) = \\frac{1}{a-s} \\left[ e^{(a-s)t} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( \\text{Re}(a-s) < 0 \\), \\( e^{(a-s)t} \\to 0 \\) as \\( t \\to \\infty \\):\n   \\[\n   f(z) = \\frac{1}{a-s}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   The result \\( f(z) = \\frac{1}{a-s} \\) shows that \\( f(z) \\) depends on both \\( a \\) and \\( s \\). The value of \\( s \\) affects the convergence and the form of the result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The given function is \\( f(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\( z(t) \\)**: We substitute \\( z(t) = e^{at} \\) into the integral:\n   \\[\n   f(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{at} \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(a-s)t} \\, dt.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluate the Integral**:\n   - The integral converges if the real part of \\( a - s \\) is negative (i.e., \\(\\text{Re}(a - s) < 0\\)).\n   - Assuming this condition holds, we can evaluate the integral:\n     \\[\n     f(z) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(a-s)t}}{a-s} \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{s-a}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Dependence Analysis**:\n   - From the evaluation, we see that \\( f(z) \\) depends on both \\( s \\) and \\( a \\). Specifically, it is given by \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( f(z) \\) is not solely dependent on \\( a \\); it also depends on \\( s \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Based on the analysis, \\( f(z) \\) does depend on \\( s \\) as well as \\( a \\).\n\nThus, the answer to the question \"Does \\( f(z) \\) only depend on the parameter \\( a \\)? \" is No.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
