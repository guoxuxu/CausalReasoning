    "To determine whether we can exactly identify which parameters were modified (A, B, or both) based solely on the final state \\(Z(s)\\), let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Given System of Differential Equations**:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{x} = Ax + By\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\n   \\]\n\n2. **Applying Laplace Transform**:\n   - For \\(x(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     sX(s) - x(0) = AX(s) + BY(s)\n     \\]\n   - For \\(y(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     sY(s) - y(0) = CX(s) + DY(s)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Rearranging the Equations**:\n   - For \\(x(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     (s - A)X(s) - BY(s) = x(0)\n     \\]\n   - For \\(y(t)\\):\n     \\[\n     (s - D)Y(s) - CX(s) = y(0)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\)**:\n   These are linear equations in terms of \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\).

    "To determine whether we can identify which parameters were modified (A or B) based solely on the final state \\(Z(s)\\), let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Given System of Differential Equations:**\n   \\[\n   \\dot{x} = Ax + By\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\dot{y} = Cx + Dy\n   \\]\n\n2. **Applying Laplace Transform:**\n   The Laplace transforms of the given differential equations are:\n   \\[\n   sX(s) - x(0) = AX(s) + BY(s)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   sY(s) - y(0) = CX(s) + DY(s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Rearranging for \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\):**\n   \\[\n   (s - A)X(s) - BY(s) = x(0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   CX(s) + (s - D)Y(s) = y(0)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\):**\n   To solve these equations, we need to express \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\) in terms of \\(x(0)\\) and \\(y(0)\\):\n   \\[\n   X(s) = \\frac{(s - D)y(0) + BY(s)}{C(s - A)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = \\frac{(s - A)x(0) - BX(s)}{D(s - C)}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final State \\(Z(s)\\):**\n   The final state \\(Z(s)\\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = X(s) + iY(s)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Analyzing \\(Z(s)\\):**\n   From the above expressions, we see that \\(X(s)\\) and \\(Y(s)\\) are intertwined through each other.
