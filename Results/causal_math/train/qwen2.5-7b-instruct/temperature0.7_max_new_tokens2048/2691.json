Rotation matrices preserve the length and angles of vectors, which means they do not change the physical properties of the flow but merely orient it differently in space. Therefore, applying \\( T \\) at any time does not alter the underlying fluid dynamics; it only reorients the velocity field in a new coordinate system.\n\n3. **Transformation \\( S \\)**:\n   Another transformation \\( S \\) (also a rotation matrix) is applied at a specific time \\( t_1 \\). Similar to \\( T \\), this transformation also reorients the velocity field without changing its dynamics.\n\n4. **State Evolution Post-Transformation**:\n   After applying the transformations \\( T \\) and \\( S \\), the state of the fluid should evolve according to the Navier-Stokes equation, but since rotations are linear transformations that preserve the structure of the velocity field, the evolution post-transformation still follows the same principles as the original equation.\n\n5. **Independence from Transformations**:\n   The key point here is whether the state \\( u(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on the transformations \\( T \\) and \\( S \\). Since both \\( T \\) and \\( S \\) are just rotations, they do not introduce any new dynamics or change the intrinsic behavior of the fluid. They merely change the orientation of the velocity field in space.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the state \\( u(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will indeed depend only on the original fluid dynamics and not on the transformations \\( T \\) or \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",

Essentially, \\( T \\) represents a change in the coordinate system but keeps the physical properties of the flow the same.\n\n3. **Transformation \\( S \\)**: Similarly, \\( S \\) is another rotation matrix, which means it also rotates the velocity field without changing its physical properties.\n\n4. **Effect of Transformations on Fluid Dynamics**: Both \\( T \\) and \\( S \\) are linear transformations that preserve the inner product structure of the velocity field. Therefore, they do not alter the underlying dynamics described by the Navier-Stokes equation.
