For the first part:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^t e^{as} \\cos(bs) ds = \\frac{e^{at}(a\\cos(bt) + b\\sin(bt)) - 1}{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n   And for the second part:\n   \\[\n   \\int_0^t e^{as} \\sin(bs) ds = \\frac{e^{at}(b\\cos(bt) - a\\sin(bt))}{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n   Combining these results, we get:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\frac{e^{at}(a\\cos(bt) + b\\sin(bt)) - 1 + i(e^{at}(b\\cos(bt) - a\\sin(bt)))}{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine Uniqueness of Parameters**:\n   To determine if \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be uniquely determined from \\( T(z) \\), consider the form of \\( T(z) \\). The expression for \\( T(z) \\) involves both \\( e^{at} \\) and trigonometric functions of \\( bt \\). The exponential term \\( e^{at} \\) depends on \\( a \\), and the trigonometric terms depend on \\( b \\).\n\n   However, the presence of \\( t \\) in the exponent means that \\( T(z) \\) will vary with \\( t \\), and it does not directly provide a unique way to extract \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) without additional information or constraints. The value of \\( T(z) \\) at a specific \\( t \\) does not uniquely determine \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) because different values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) could yield similar values of \\( T(z) \\) for certain \\( t \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Based on the analysis, the original parameters \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) cannot be uniquely determined from the outcome of \\( T(z) \\) without additional information or constraints.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function given is \\( z(t) = e^{(a+ib)t} \\). This can be rewritten using Euler's formula as \\( z(t) = e^{at}(\\cos(bt) + i\\sin(bt)) \\).\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The transformation \\( T(z) = \\int_0^t z(s) ds \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\). So, we need to evaluate:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{as}(\\cos(bs) + i\\sin(bs)) ds.\n   \\]\n   This can be split into two integrals:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{as}\\cos(bs) ds + i \\int_0^t e^{as}\\sin(bs) ds.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Evaluating the Integrals**:\n   - For the real part: \\( \\int_0^t e^{as}\\cos(bs) ds \\), we use integration by parts.\n   - For the imaginary part: \\( \\int_0^t e^{as}\\sin(bs) ds \\), we also use integration by parts.\n\n4. **General Form of the Solution**:\n   The results of these integrals will involve exponential functions with \\( a \\) and trigonometric functions with \\( b \\). Specifically, the solution will be of the form:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\left( \\frac{e^{at}}{a^2 + b^2} (a\\cos(bt) + b\\sin(bt)) - \\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2} (\\cos(bt) + a\\sin(bt)) \\right) + i \\left( \\frac{e^{at}}{a^2 + b^2} (b\\cos(bt) - a\\sin(bt)) - \\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2} (\\sin(bt) - b\\cos(bt)) \\right).\n   \\]\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Parameters**:\n   From the form of \\( T(z) \\), it is evident that the parameters \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) appear explicitly in the denominators and coefficients. However, the exact values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) cannot be uniquely determined solely from the outcome of \\( T(z) \\) without additional information because the same form can result from different combinations of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
