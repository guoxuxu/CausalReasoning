    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Functions:**\n   - \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) is a simple quadratic function.\n   - \\( g(z) = \\int_0^z e^{w^2} dw \\) is an integral transformation from 0 to \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Complex Analysis Considerations:**\n   - The function \\( e^{w^2} \\) is entire (analytic everywhere in the complex plane).\n   - The integral \\( g(z) \\) is path-independent in the complex plane due to the Cauchy integral theorem for entire functions.\n\n3. **Inverse Problem:**\n   - We want to determine if knowing \\( g(z) \\) allows us to uniquely determine \\( z \\) without additional information.\n\n4. **Analyzing \\( g(z) \\):**\n   - The function \\( g(z) \\) is essentially the antiderivative of \\( e^{w^2} \\) from 0 to \\( z \\).\n   - For \\( g(z) \\) to be uniquely invertible, \\( g(z) \\) must be one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective) over its domain.\n\n5. **Injectivity of \\( g(z) \\):**\n   - Since \\( e^{w^2} \\) is not injective (it has repeated values for different \\( w \\)), \\( g(z) \\) may not be injective either.\n   - Specifically, \\( g(z) \\) will have the same value for different paths in the complex plane that end at the same point.\n\n6. **Surjectivity and Path Dependence:**\n   - While \\( g(z) \\) is surjective over its range, it is not globally injective due to the non-uniqueness of paths in the complex plane.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Without additional information such as the specific path taken in the complex plane, we cannot uniquely determine \\( z \\) from \\( g(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine if we can uniquely determine \\( z \\) from the value of \\( g(z) \\).\n\n1. **Understanding the Functions:**\n   - We have \\( z = f(x) = x^2 \\), which maps real numbers to complex numbers.\n   - The function \\( g(z) = \\int_0^z e^{w^2} dw \\) is an integral transformation that involves integrating the complex exponential function \\( e^{w^2} \\) from 0 to \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Properties of \\( g(z) \\):**\n   - The function \\( g(z) \\) is an antiderivative of \\( e^{z^2} \\). This means it is related to the complex error function (erf) up to a constant factor, but for our purposes, the exact form isn't crucial.\n   - The integral \\( g(z) \\) depends on the path in the complex plane from 0 to \\( z \\), due to the nature of complex integration and the non-elementary nature of the integrand \\( e^{w^2} \\).\n\n3. **Implications of Complex Integration:**\n   - Since the integral is taken along a path in the complex plane, different paths from 0 to \\( z \\) can yield different values of \\( g(z) \\).
