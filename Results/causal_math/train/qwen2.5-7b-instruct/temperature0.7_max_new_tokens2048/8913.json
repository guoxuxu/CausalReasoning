The presence of the growing exponential term means that the solution at \\( t = T \\) will differ from the case where no such term is added, even if the initial voltage is adjusted accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the voltage \\( V(t) \\) at \\( t = T \\) will not be the same if the function \\( g(V) \\) is used to modify the initial voltage \\( V_0 \\) compared to applying \\( V_0 \\) directly to the differential equation.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
