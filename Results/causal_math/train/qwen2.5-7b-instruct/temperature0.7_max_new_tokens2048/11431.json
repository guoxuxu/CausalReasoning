    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: We start with \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).

    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( F(z)(\\xi) \\). For the initial function, the Fourier transform would be:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i2\\pi\\xi t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral can be simplified to:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\xi) = \\delta(\\xi - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function. This means that the spectrum (or frequency content) is concentrated at \\( \\xi = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\).\n\n3. **Phase Shifting Operation**: At time \\( t = 1 \\), a phase shift \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) is applied to \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) \\to e^{i\\theta}z(t)\n   \\]\n   This results in:\n   \\[\n   z(t) \\to e^{i\\theta} e^{i\\omega t} = e^{i(\\omega t + \\theta)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **New Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of the new function \\( e^{i(\\omega t + \\theta)} \\) is:\n   \\[\n   F(e^{i(\\omega t + \\theta)})(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega t + \\theta)} e^{-i2\\pi\\xi t} dt\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the exponent:\n   \\[\n   F(e^{i(\\omega t + \\theta)})(\\xi) = e^{i\\theta} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - 2\\pi\\xi)t} dt\n   \\]\n   The integral is again a Dirac delta function:\n   \\[\n   F(e^{i(\\omega t + \\theta)})(\\xi) = e^{i\\theta} \\delta(\\xi - \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi})\n   \\]\n\n5. **Influence on Spectrum**: The phase shift \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) only affects the overall phase of the spectrum but does not change the location of the peak in the frequency domain. Therefore, the spectrum at any time \\( T > 1 \\) will still be concentrated at \\( \\xi = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\), with a phase shift of \\( \\theta \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the spectrum at any time \\( T > 1 \\) will show influence from both the original transformation and the intervention (phase shift). Thus, the answer is \"No\".\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
