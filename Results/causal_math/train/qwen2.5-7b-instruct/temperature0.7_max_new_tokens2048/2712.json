However, if \\( B = 0 \\), then the transformation does not change the state, making it indistinguishable from the original state.\n\nSince the problem does not specify \\( B \\neq 0 \\), and we cannot definitively say that \\( B \\) is non-zero, we cannot guarantee distinct identification based solely on \\( z(T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
