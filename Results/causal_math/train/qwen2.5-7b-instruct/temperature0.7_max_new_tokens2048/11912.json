    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: We start with \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\). This represents a unit circle in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( e^{it} \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{it}\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{it} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i)t} dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral converges for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(s-i)t} dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-(s-i)t}}{-(s-i)} \\right]_0^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{s-i}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{it}\\} = \\frac{1}{s-i} \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - To find the inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s-i} \\), we need to identify the function that maps to this expression under the Laplace transform.\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s-a} \\) is \\( e^{at} \\).\n   - Thus, the inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s-i} \\) is \\( e^{it} \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Applying the Laplace transform to \\( z(t) \\) and then the inverse Laplace transform returns us to the original function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\).\n\nTherefore, the original function \\( z(t) \\) remains unaltered after these transformations.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To determine if the original function \\( z(t) \\) remains unaltered after applying the Laplace transform and then the inverse Laplace transform, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Function**: The function given is \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which represents a unit circle in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Apply the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{it}\\} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-st} e^{it} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(i-s)t} dt\n   \\]\n   This integral converges for \\( \\Re(s) > 1 \\).
