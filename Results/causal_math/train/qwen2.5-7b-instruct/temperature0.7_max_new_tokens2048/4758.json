This equation describes how the function \\( u(x, t) \\) changes over time due to diffusion or heat conduction.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: The Fourier Transform \\( \\mathcal{F}[u](k) \\) of the function \\( u(x, t) \\) provides information about the frequency components of \\( u(x, t) \\). Applying the Fourier Transform to both sides of the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}[u]}{\\partial t} = D \\mathcal{F}[u]\n   \\]\n   This transformed equation is easier to solve because it is now an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time.\n\n3. **Solving the Transformed Equation**: The solution to this ODE depends on the initial condition \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)] \\). Assuming the initial condition is known, the solution for \\( \\mathcal{F}[u](k, t) \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[u](k, t) = \\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k) e^{-D(k^2)t}\n   \\]\n   where \\( k \\) represents the frequency variable.\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find \\( u(x, t) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{F}[u](k, t) \\), we apply the inverse Fourier Transform:\n   \\[\n   u(x, t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}[u](k, t)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k) e^{-D(k^2)t}]\n   \\]\n   This can be simplified using the convolution theorem:\n   \\[\n   u(x, t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k)] * e^{-D(k^2)t}\n   \\]\n   where \\( * \\) denotes convolution.\n\n5. **Determining the Original Function**: To determine \\( u(x, 0) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), we need to know \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)] \\). If the Fourier Transform was applied at \\( t = 0 \\), then \\( \\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)] \\) is known. However, if no Fourier Transform was applied at \\( t = 0 \\), then \\( u(x, 0) \\) cannot be directly determined from \\( u(x, T) \\) alone without additional information.\n\nGiven that the problem does not specify whether the Fourier Transform was applied at \\( t = 0 \\), we cannot definitively determine \\( u(x, 0) \\) just from observing \\( u(x, T) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
