Since the shift is purely vertical, the orientation and shape of the contour remain the same, only its position changes.\n\n3. **Integral Transformation**: The integral \\(\\oint_C f(z) \\, dz\\) is a line integral of the function \\(f(z)\\) over the contour \\(C\\). When we apply the transformation \\(g(z)\\) to \\(C\\) to get \\(C'\\), the integral over \\(C'\\) would be \\(\\oint_{C'} f(z) \\, dz\\).
