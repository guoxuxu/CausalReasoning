    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a function \\( g(z) = e^{iz} \\) where \\( z \\) is a complex number. There's also a linear transformation defined by a matrix \\( M \\), such that \\( f(z) = Mz \\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: The function \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) represents the composition of the functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\). Specifically, for a given \\( z_0 \\), we first apply the transformation \\( f \\) to \\( z_0 \\) to get \\( Mz_0 \\), and then apply \\( g \\) to this result.\n\n3. **Matrix Transformation Change**: If the matrix \\( M \\) is modified to \\( N \\), the new transformation becomes \\( f'(z) = Nz \\).\n\n4. **Impact on Composition**: When we change \\( M \\) to \\( N \\), the new composition would be \\( g(f'(z_0)) = g(Nz_0) \\).\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**: The key point here is whether the value of \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) (which is \\( g(Mz_0) \\)) depends solely on \\( M \\) or if it changes when \\( M \\) is replaced by \\( N \\). Since \\( g \\) is applied to the transformed value \\( Mz_0 \\), any change in \\( M \\) directly impacts the argument of \\( g \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Because \\( g(f(z_0)) = g(Mz_0) \\), and \\( g \\) is dependent on its argument, changing \\( M \\) to \\( N \\) means that \\( g(f(z_0)) \\) will no longer depend solely on the original \\( M \\); instead, it will depend on the new matrix \\( N \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
