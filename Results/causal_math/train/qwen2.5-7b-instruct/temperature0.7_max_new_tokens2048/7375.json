    "To determine if the resulting state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is solely determined by \\( M \\), independent of \\( N \\) or \\( K \\), let's analyze the given transformations and their effects on \\( z(t) \\).\n\n1. **Initial Transformation with \\( g(z) \\):**\n   - The initial transformation is given by \\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\).\n   - This means that at any time \\( t \\), the function \\( z(t) \\) is transformed according to \\( z'(t) = e^{Nt}z(t) \\).\n\n2. **Differential Equation Governing \\( z(t) \\):**\n   - The function \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\).\n   - This implies that without any additional transformations, \\( z(t) \\) would evolve as \\( z(t) = z(0)e^{Mt} \\).\n\n3. **Intervention with \\( h(z) \\):**\n   - An intervention is applied at time \\( t_1 \\) using the transformation \\( h(z) = e^{Kt}z \\).\n   - This means that at \\( t = t_1 \\), the state of \\( z \\) is transformed to \\( z(t_1) = e^{Kt_1}z(t_1^-) \\), where \\( z(t_1^-) \\) is the state immediately before the intervention.\n\n4. **Behavior after Intervention:**\n   - After the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the function continues to evolve under the original differential equation \\( \\frac{dz}{dt} = Mz \\).\n   - Therefore, from \\( t_1 \\) onwards, the state evolves as \\( z(t) = z(t_1)e^{M(t-t_1)} \\).\n\n5. **Final State at Time \\( T \\):**\n   - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the state at time \\( T \\) can be written as:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = z(t_1)e^{M(T-t_1)}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\( z(t_1) \\) itself is influenced by the initial transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Nt}z \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     z(t_1) = e^{Nt_1}z(0)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting this into the expression for \\( z(T) \\):\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{Nt_1}z(0)e^{M(T-t_1)} = z(0)e^{Nt_1}e^{M(T-t_1)}\n     \\]\n\nFrom the above analysis, it is clear that the final state \\( z(T) \\) is influenced not only by \\( M \\) but also by \\( N \\).
