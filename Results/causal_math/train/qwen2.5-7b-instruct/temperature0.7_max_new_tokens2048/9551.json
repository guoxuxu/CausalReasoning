Specifically, the term \\( e^{At_1} \\) from the initial transformation is multiplied by \\( e^{B(T-t_1)} \\) due to the intervention. Therefore, the final state \\( z(T) \\) is not independent of the initial transformation \\( f(z) \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation \\( f(z) \\):**\n   - We start with \\( z(t) = x(t) + iy(t) \\).\n   - Applying the transformation \\( f(z) = e^{At}z \\) gives us:\n     \\[\n     z(t_1) = e^{At_1}(x(t_1) + iy(t_1))\n     \\]\n\n2. **Intervention Transformation \\( g(z) \\):**\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), we apply another transformation \\( g(z) = e^{Bt}z \\).\n   - This means that after \\( t_1 \\), the new state of \\( z \\) is:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = e^{B(t-t_1)}z(t_1)\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( z(t_1) \\) from the previous step:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = e^{B(t-t_1)}e^{At_1}(x(t_1) + iy(t_1)) = e^{At_1 + B(t-t_1)}(x(t_1) + iy(t_1))\n     \\]\n\n3. **Final State at Time \\( T \\):**\n   - For \\( T > t_1 \\), the state of \\( z \\) at time \\( T \\) is:\n     \\[\n     z(T) = e^{At_1 + B(T-t_1)}(x(t_1) + iy(t_1))\n     \\]\n\n4. **Independence Analysis:**\n   - The final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on both the initial transformation \\( f(z) \\) (through \\( e^{At_1} \\)) and the subsequent intervention \\( g(z) \\) (through \\( e^{B(T-t_1)} \\)).\n   - Therefore, the resulting state \\( z(T) \\) is not independent of the initial transformation \\( f(z) \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
