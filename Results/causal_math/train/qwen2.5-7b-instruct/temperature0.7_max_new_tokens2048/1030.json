    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the given PDE and its solution**: The PDE \\(\\partial_t u = D \\partial_{xx} u\\) is a linear diffusion (heat) equation. The general solution to this equation can be written using the initial condition \\(u(x,0)\\). However, for our purposes, we don't need the explicit form of the solution; we just need to understand how it evolves over time.\n\n2. **Transformation application**: We have a transformation \\(g(u) = u + e^{Ct}\\). If this transformation is applied to the function \\(u(x,t)\\), then the new function \\(v(x,t)\\) would be:\n   \\[\n   v(x,t) = u(x,t) + e^{Ct}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Observation at time \\(T\\)**: Suppose we observe \\(u(x,T)\\) at some later time \\(T\\). This means we know \\(v(x,T) - e^{CT}\\) because \\(v(x,T) = u(x,T) + e^{CT}\\).\n\n4. **Reversing the transformation**: To find \\(u(x,0)\\) from \\(u(x,T)\\), we would need to reverse the transformation. However, the transformation adds \\(e^{CT}\\) which is a time-dependent term. Without knowing \\(C\\), we cannot uniquely determine \\(u(x,0)\\) from \\(u(x,T)\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the transformation \\(g(u) = u + e^{Ct}\\) introduces a time-dependent shift that depends on the unknown constant \\(C\\), it is not possible to uniquely deduce the original function \\(u(x,0)\\) at \\(t=0\\) from observing \\(u(x,T)\\) at \\(t=T\\) without additional information about \\(C\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE and Transformation**:\n   - The given PDE is a standard diffusion equation: \\( \\partial_t u = D \\partial_{xx} u \\).\n   - The transformation is \\( g(u) = u + e^{Ct} \\).\n\n2. **Implications of the Transformation**:\n   - If \\( g(u) \\) is applied, then \\( u(x, t) \\) becomes \\( v(x, t) = u(x, t) + e^{Ct} \\).\n   - We need to check if applying \\( g(u) \\) affects our ability to recover \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\).\n\n3. **Recovering \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\)**:\n   - To find \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\), we would ideally need to reverse the time evolution of the diffusion equation.\n   - However, the transformation \\( g(u) \\) adds a term \\( e^{Ct} \\) which is not part of the original solution \\( u(x, t) \\).\n\n4. **Effect of the Transformation on Time Evolution**:\n   - Applying \\( g(u) \\) at any time \\( t \\) shifts the entire function \\( u(x, t) \\) by \\( e^{Ct} \\).\n   - This shift is constant in space but increases exponentially with time.\n   - When we observe \\( u(x, T) \\), it includes this additional term \\( e^{CT} \\).\n\n5. **Reversing the Process**:\n   - To reverse this process, we would need to subtract \\( e^{CT} \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\).\n   - However, without knowing whether \\( g(u) \\) was applied, we cannot determine if such a correction is necessary.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since we don't know if \\( g(u) \\) was applied, we cannot definitively correct for the shift caused by \\( e^{Ct} \\).\n   - Therefore, we cannot reliably deduce \\( u(x, 0) \\) from \\( u(x, T) \\) without additional information.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Original PDE**: The given PDE is \\( \\partial_t u = D \\partial_{xx} u \\).
