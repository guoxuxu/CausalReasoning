    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step to reason through whether it's possible to determine the specific decay rate \\(k\\) or \\(k'\\) applied at any time without prior knowledge of the intervention times.\n\n1. **Original System**: The original system is governed by the differential equation \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = -kx\\). This describes exponential decay with a constant decay rate \\(k\\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of the function \\(f(t) = x_0 e^{-kt}\\) is:\n   \\[\n   L[f(t)](s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x_0 e^{-kt} e^{-st} dt = x_0 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(k+s)t} dt = \\frac{x_0}{k + s}\n   \\]\n   So, the Laplace transform of \\(f(t)\\) is \\(\\frac{x_0}{k + s}\\).\n\n3. **Impact of Intervention**: If there is an intervention that changes the decay rate from \\(k\\) to \\(k'\\) at some point in time, the system would no longer be purely exponential with a single decay rate. Instead, it would involve a combination of exponential terms corresponding to both \\(k\\) and \\(k'\\).\n\n4. **Post-Intervention Behavior**: After the intervention, the system's behavior would be a superposition of two decaying exponentials: one with decay rate \\(k\\) and another with decay rate \\(k'\\). The Laplace transform of such a system would involve both \\(k\\) and \\(k'\\).\n\n5. **Determine Decay Rates**: To determine the decay rates \\(k\\) and \\(k'\\), we need to analyze the transformed system.
