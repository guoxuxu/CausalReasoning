This implies that the state \\( x \\) is transformed by the matrix exponential of \\( F \\) over time \\( t \\).\n   - However, since we are considering the evolution of \\( x \\) under \\( D \\), the transformation due to \\( F \\) does not directly affect the differential equation but changes how \\( x \\) is represented.\n\n3. **Intervention with \\( h(x) \\)**:\n   - At time \\( t_1 \\), an intervention changes the state evolution to \\( h(x) = e^{Gt}x \\). This introduces a new transformation due to \\( G \\).\n   - The intervention effectively modifies the state representation but does not change the underlying dynamics described by \\( D \\).\n\n4. **Post-Intervention Dynamics**:\n   - After the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the system continues to evolve according to its original dynamics, i.e., \\( \\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\), but now the state is represented differently due to the transformation \\( h(x) \\).\n\n5. **Final State at Time \\( T \\)**:\n   - To find \\( x(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\), we need to integrate the differential equation from \\( t_1 \\) to \\( T \\).\n   - The solution to the differential equation \\( \\dot{x} = Dx + Cu \\) is \\( x(t) = e^{D(t-t_1)}x(t_1) + \\int_{t_1}^{t} e^{D(t-\\tau)}Cu(\\tau) d\\tau \\).\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - The final state \\( x(T) \\) depends on the initial state at \\( t_1 \\), which itself is influenced by both \\( D \\) and \\( F \\) (through the transformation \\( g(x) \\)), and the control input \\( u \\).\n   - However, the key point is that after \\( t_1 \\), the dynamics continue to be governed by \\( D \\).
