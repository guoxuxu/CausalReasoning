    "To address this question, let's break down the steps involved:\n\n1. **Understanding the Schrödinger Equation**: The given equation describes the time evolution of a wave function \\( \\psi(x, t) \\) in position space under the influence of a potential \\( V(x) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying a Fourier transform to \\( \\psi(x, t) \\) results in \\( \\psi(p, t) \\), the momentum space representation of the wave function at time \\( t \\).\n\n3. **Evolution in Position Space**: If the system evolves first in position space from an initial state \\( \\psi(x, 0) \\) to \\( \\psi(x, T) \\) and then a Fourier transform is applied, we get \\( \\psi(p, T) \\).\n\n4. **Initial Fourier Transformation**: If the initial wave function \\( \\psi(x, 0) \\) is first Fourier transformed to \\( \\psi(p, 0) \\), and then the system evolves in momentum space (which would involve a different form of the Schrödinger equation due to the change in basis), the resulting wave function at time \\( T \\) would be \\( \\psi(p, T) \\).\n\n5. **Reversibility and Uniqueness**: Given that the Fourier transform is a one-to-one transformation, there is a unique inverse Fourier transform. Therefore, if we have the wave function in momentum space at any time, we can uniquely determine the corresponding wave function in position space at the same time.\n\n6. **Determining the Initial Condition**: Since the Fourier transform of a function is unique, knowing \\( \\psi(p, T) \\) allows us to uniquely reconstruct \\( \\psi(x, T) \\) using the inverse Fourier transform.
