    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a vector \\(v\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) that rotates over time according to the function \\(f(t, v) = e^{i\\theta t}v\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the angular velocity.\n\n2. **Intervention**: At time \\(t_1\\), a linear transformation \\(L(v) = sv\\) is applied, where \\(s > 0\\) is a scaling factor. This means that at time \\(t_1\\), the vector \\(v\\) becomes \\(sv\\).\n\n3. **Continuation of Rotation**: After the scaling, the vector \\(sv\\) continues to rotate according to the same function \\(f(t, v)\\).

Therefore, the state of the vector at time \\(T\\) is:\n   \\[\n   f(T - t_1, sv) = e^{i\\theta (T - t_1)}sv\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**: The expression for the final state at time \\(T\\) is \\(e^{i\\theta (T - t_1)}sv\\). This expression shows that the final state depends on both the rotational factor \\(e^{i\\theta (T - t_1)}\\) and the scaling factor \\(s\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the final state at time \\(T\\) explicitly includes the scaling factor \\(s\\), it cannot be said that the final state depends only on the rotational transformation and not on the scaling factor \\(s\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",

So, from time \\(t_1\\) onwards, the vector evolves as \\(e^{i\\theta (t - t_1)}sv\\).\n\n3. **Final State at Time \\(T\\)**: To find the final state at time \\(T > t_1\\), we substitute \\(t = T\\) into the rotation formula:\n   \\[\n   f(T, sv) = e^{i\\theta (T - t_1)}sv\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   f(T, sv) = s \\cdot e^{i\\theta (T - t_1)}v\n   \\]\n\n4. **Dependency Analysis**: From the expression above, it is clear that the final state at time \\(T\\) depends on both the rotational transformation \\(e^{i\\theta (T - t_1)}v\\) and the scaling factor \\(s\\).\n\nTherefore, the final state at time \\(T\\) does depend on the scaling factor \\(s\\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
