This transformation allows us to analyze the system behavior in the frequency domain.\n\n2. **Convolution in the Time Domain**: In the time domain, the convolution of two functions \\( f(t) \\) and \\( g(t) \\) is represented as:\n   \\[\n   (f * g)(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} f(\\tau)g(t-\\tau)d\\tau\n   \\]\n   The Laplace transform of a convolution is the product of the individual Laplace transforms:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{(f * g)(t)\\}(s) = F(s)G(s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiplication in the Laplace Domain**: Multiplying the Laplace transforms of two functions corresponds to a specific operation in the time domain, but it does not directly represent a convolution.
