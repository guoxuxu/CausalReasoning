The Fourier transform of the second derivative \\(u''(x)\\) is related to the Fourier transform of \\(u(x)\\) by the property \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{u''(x)\\} = (2\\pi i \\xi)^2 \\hat{u}(\\xi)\\).\n   - Therefore, if \\(Lu = -u''(x)\\), then the Fourier transform of \\(Lu\\) is \\(\\mathcal{F}\\{Lu\\} = (2\\pi i \\xi)^2 \\hat{u}(\\xi) = -4\\pi^2 \\xi^2 \\hat{u}(\\xi)\\).\n\n3. **Final State \\(u(T)\\)**:\n   - The final state \\(u(T)\\) is given.
