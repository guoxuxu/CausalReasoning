    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Differential Equation**: We start with the second-order linear homogeneous differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} + p(x) \\frac{du}{dx} + q(x)u = 0\n   \\]\n   with initial conditions.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Application**: Applying the Laplace Transform to both sides of the differential equation converts it into an algebraic equation in the Laplace domain. The Laplace Transform of \\(u(x)\\) is denoted as \\(U(s)\\), where \\(s\\) is the complex frequency variable.

This would give us a new function in terms of the Fourier variable, but it does not change the underlying differential equation itself.\n\n4. **Invertible Transformation Back**: Transforming back from the Fourier domain to the spatial domain using the inverse Fourier Transform will return us to the original spatial domain function. However, the Fourier Transform does not alter the fundamental nature of the differential equation; it merely provides a different perspective on the problem.\n\n5. **Resulting Function \\(u(x)\\)**: The function \\(u(x)\\) obtained after these transformations should still satisfy the original differential equation because the Fourier Transform is applied to the transformed solution, not the original differential equation. The initial conditions and the differential equation constraints remain unchanged by these transforms.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the resulting function \\(u(x)\\) will indeed reflect changes due only to the original differential equation, despite the intermediate use of the Fourier Transform.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
