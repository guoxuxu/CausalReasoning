The exponential term \\( e^{az} \\) is central to how the magnitude of \\( g(z) \\) behaves as \\( a \\) changes.\n\n2. **Effect of Increasing 'a'**: When we increase the value of \\( a \\), the term \\( e^{az} \\) grows exponentially for large values of \\( z \\).

The contour C is a closed curve in the complex plane that encloses the point w.\n\n2. **Behavior of Exponential Function**: As 'a' increases, the term \\( e^{az} \\) grows exponentially for any non-zero z.
