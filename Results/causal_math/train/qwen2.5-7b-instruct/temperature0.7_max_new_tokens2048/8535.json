    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Initial System Description\nThe initial system is described by the differential equation:\n\\[ \\dot{I}(t) = -RI(t) + V_0 \\]\nThis can be solved using standard methods, but let's focus on the Laplace Transform approach.\n\n### Step 2: Applying Laplace Transform\nTaking the Laplace Transform of both sides, assuming zero initial conditions for simplicity (or that any initial conditions are absorbed into the constants), we get:\n\\[ sI(s) - I(0) = -RI(s) + \\frac{V_0}{s} \\]\nAssuming \\( I(0) = 0 \\), this simplifies to:\n\\[ sI(s) = -RI(s) + \\frac{V_0}{s} \\]\n\\[ I(s) = \\frac{V_0}{s(s + R)} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Introducing Additional Voltage\nNow, consider the additional voltage \\( V_1 e^{-Rt} \\) introduced at time \\( t_1 \\). This modifies the differential equation to:\n\\[ \\dot{I}(t) = -RI(t) + V_0 + V_1 e^{-R(t-t_1)} u(t-t_1) \\]\nwhere \\( u(t-t_1) \\) is the unit step function shifted by \\( t_1 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Applying Laplace Transform Again\nTaking the Laplace Transform of the modified equation:\n\\[ sI(s) - I(t_1^-) = -RI(s) + \\frac{V_0}{s} + \\frac{V_1 e^{-Rt_1}}{s + R} \\]\nAssuming \\( I(t_1^-) = 0 \\) (or that it's zero before the step change), this becomes:\n\\[ sI(s) = -RI(s) + \\frac{V_0}{s} + \\frac{V_1 e^{-Rt_1}}{s + R} \\]\n\\[ I(s) = \\frac{V_0}{s(s + R)} + \\frac{V_1 e^{-Rt_1}}{s(s + R)(s + R)} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Inverse Laplace Transform\nThe inverse Laplace Transform of the first term is:\n\\[ \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{V_0}{s(s + R)}\\right\\} = V_0 (1 - e^{-Rt}) \\]\nThe second term involves a time shift:\n\\[ \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{V_1 e^{-Rt_1}}{s(s + R)(s + R)}\\right\\} = V_1 e^{-Rt_1} e^{-R(t - t_1)} u(t - t_1) = V_1 e^{-R(t - t_1)} u(t - t_1) \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe future behavior of \\( I(t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) includes contributions from both \\( V_0 \\) and \\( V_1 e^{-R(t - t_1)} \\), which means it does not depend solely on \\( R \\) and \\( V_0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
