    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Transformation**: The initial state of \\( w(z) \\) is transformed according to the integral equation:\n   \\[\n   w'(z) = \\int_D K(z, s) w(s) \\, ds\n   \\]\n   This means that the value of \\( w'(z) \\) depends on the values of \\( w(s) \\) for all \\( s \\) in the domain \\( D \\), weighted by the kernel \\( K(z, s) \\).\n\n2. **Introduction of New Kernel Transformation**: An additional kernel transformation \\( K_2 \\) is introduced.
