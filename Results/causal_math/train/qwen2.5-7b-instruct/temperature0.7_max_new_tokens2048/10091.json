However, the specific form of \\( g(z) \\) is not provided, so we must consider how \\( h(z) \\) fits into the overall structure.\n\n5. **Laplace Transform of \\( h(z) \\)**: The Laplace transform of \\( h(z) = e^{bz}z \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}(e^{bz}z)(s) = \\frac{1}{(s-b)^2}\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Laplace transform depends explicitly on \\( b \\).\n\n6. **Impact on \\( F(s) \\)**: Since \\( h(z) \\) directly influences the form of \\( g(z) \\) and its Laplace transform, and since the Laplace transform of \\( h(z) \\) includes \\( b \\), it follows that \\( F(s) \\) will depend on \\( b \\).\n\n7. **Independence from \\( a \\)**: The original \\( F(s) \\) was dependent on \\( a \\). Introducing \\( h(z) \\) does not remove this dependency; it only adds a new dependency on \\( b \\).\n\nTherefore, the resulting \\( F(s) \\) will not be independent of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if the resulting \\(F(s)\\) will be independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Function and Transform**:\n   - The initial function is \\(f(z) = z^2 + cz\\).\n   - The Laplace transform is defined as \\(F(s) = \\mathcal{L}(e^{az}g(z))(s)\\).\n\n2. **Impact of Additional Function \\(h(z)\\)**:\n   - An additional function \\(h(z) = e^{bz}z\\) is applied.\n   - This impacts \\(z\\) in the function formulation, meaning \\(h(z)\\) modifies how \\(z\\) is used in the expression for \\(F(s)\\).\n\n3. **Effect on \\(F(s)\\)**:\n   - The modified function due to \\(h(z)\\) would involve substituting \\(z\\) with \\(z' = e^{bz}z\\).\n   - Therefore, the new function becomes \\(f(z') = (e^{bz}z)^2 + c(e^{bz}z)\\).\n\n4. **Transforming the New Function**:\n   - The Laplace transform of the new function is now \\(F'(s) = \\mathcal{L}(e^{a(e^{bz}z)}g(e^{bz}z))(s)\\).\n\n5. **Independence from \\(a\\) and \\(b\\)**:\n   - For \\(F(s)\\) to be independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the form of \\(F(s)\\) must not depend on these constants after applying \\(h(z)\\).\n   - However, since \\(h(z)\\) introduces both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into the exponent and the argument of the function being transformed, it is clear that \\(F(s)\\) will depend on both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the resulting \\(F(s)\\) will not be independent of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
