This transformation modifies the trajectory of \\( z(t) \\). Specifically, at \\( t = t_1 \\), the new state of \\( z(t) \\) becomes:\n   \\[\n   z(t_1) = e^{i \\omega t_1} \\cdot z_0 \\cdot e^{i \\theta t_1} = e^{i (\\omega + \\theta) t_1} \\cdot z_0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Post-Transformation Evolution**: After \\( t_1 \\), the evolution continues as per the original function but starting from the new state \\( z(t_1) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{i \\omega (t - t_1)} \\cdot z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( z(t_1) \\):\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{i \\omega (t - t_1)} \\cdot e^{i (\\omega + \\theta) t_1} \\cdot z_0\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot z_0 \\cdot e^{i \\theta t_1}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Endpoint Analysis**: To find the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i \\omega T} \\cdot z_0 \\cdot e^{i \\theta t_1}\n   \\]\n   Since \\( T > t_1 \\), the term \\( e^{i \\theta t_1} \\) is a constant phase shift that does not affect the dependency on \\( \\omega \\) for the long-term behavior of \\( z(T) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) is determined by both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\). However, the question specifically asks if the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) only depends on \\( \\omega \\) and not on \\( \\theta \\). Given the analysis above, \\( z(T) \\) does indeed depend on \\( \\theta \\) through the term \\( e^{i \\theta t_1} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\cdot z_0 \\) describes the evolution of a complex number over time \\( t \\). Here, \\( z_0 \\) is the initial value, \\( \\omega \\) is the angular frequency, and \\( t \\) is time.\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: At time \\( t_1 \\), a transformation \\( g(t) = e^{i \\theta t} \\) is applied.
