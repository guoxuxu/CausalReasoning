This transform converts the spatial domain problem into a frequency domain problem.\n\n3. **Impact on Boundary Conditions**: The boundary conditions on \\(\\partial D\\) affect the solution \\(z\\) both inside and outside the domain. When we apply the Fourier transform, it does not directly provide information about the boundary conditions. Instead, it transforms the differential equation and the boundary conditions into an algebraic form in the frequency domain.\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To recover the solution \\(z\\) in the spatial domain from its Fourier transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(z)\\), we would need to perform an inverse Fourier transform.
