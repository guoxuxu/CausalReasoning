    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation describes how temperature evolves over time in response to spatial gradients. In our case, it is modified to include a time-varying thermal diffusivity \\( k(t) \\).\n\n2. **Modulation by \\( h(t) \\)**: The thermal diffusivity \\( k \\) is modulated by a function \\( h(t) \\), such that \\( k(t) = k_0 h(t) \\).

The temperature profile will transition smoothly from the condition before \\(t_1\\) to the new condition after \\(t_1\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - While the final temperature profile will eventually reflect the new condition imposed by the step function, it does not simply \"reflect only the new condition.\" It must also account for the historical evolution of the temperature distribution up to \\(t_1\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
