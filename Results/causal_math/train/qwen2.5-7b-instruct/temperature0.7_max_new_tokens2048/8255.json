This is a first-order linear differential equation whose solution is \\( z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( A \\) is a constant.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} A e^{i\\omega t} dt = A \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt = A \\cdot 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\) is the Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega \\), indicating that the Fourier Transform shows only the frequency component \\( \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Intervention**: If we modify \\( z(t) \\) at some time \\( t_1 \\), changing its frequency to \\( \\omega' \\), the new function can be represented as \\( z'(t) = B e^{i\\omega' t} + C e^{i\\omega t} \\), where \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) are constants. However, since the change happens at a specific point in time (a point mass), it does not affect the overall frequency content of the function when considered over all time. The Fourier Transform will still show the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) and the new frequency \\( \\omega' \\) separately, but not just the original frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The Fourier Transform of the new function \\( z'(t) \\) will show both frequencies \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\omega' \\), not just the original frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
