    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the System**: The system is described by the transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\). This represents how the system transforms an input into an output.\n\n2. **Effect of Disturbance**: The disturbance function is \\( d(t) = e^{\\lambda t} \\), which is a complex exponential in the time domain. In the Laplace domain, this becomes \\( D(s) = \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda} \\).\n\n3. **Output Due to Disturbance**: The output \\( z(t) \\) due to the disturbance can be found by multiplying the transfer function \\( H(s) \\) with the Laplace transform of the disturbance \\( D(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = H(s) \\cdot D(s) = \\left( \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda} \\right) = \\frac{s}{(s^2 + s + 1)(s - \\lambda)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To find \\( z(t) \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( Z(s) \\).

The key here is to recognize that the poles of the system (roots of the denominator in \\( H(s) \\)) are fixed and do not change with \\( \\lambda \\). The presence of \\( \\lambda \\) in the denominator of \\( Z(s) \\) introduces a pole at \\( s = \\lambda \\), which is unique for each \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the pole \\( s = \\lambda \\) is unique for each value of \\( \\lambda \\), if we know \\( z(t) \\), we can analyze its Laplace transform and identify the additional pole introduced by the disturbance.

In the Laplace domain, this becomes \\( D(s) = \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda} \\).\n\n3. **Output in Laplace Domain**: The output \\( Z(s) \\) in the Laplace domain can be found using the relationship:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = H(s)D(s) = \\left(\\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{s - \\lambda}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To find \\( z(t) \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( Z(s) \\):\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\frac{s}{(s^2 + s + 1)(s - \\lambda)}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Partial Fraction Decomposition**: We decompose \\( Z(s) \\) into partial fractions to facilitate the inverse Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{s}{(s^2 + s + 1)(s - \\lambda)} = \\frac{As + B}{s^2 + s + 1} + \\frac{C}{s - \\lambda}\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) involves equating coefficients, but the key point here is that the form of \\( Z(s) \\) includes both terms corresponding to the original system and the disturbance.\n\n6. **Inverse Laplace Transform Analysis**:\n   - The term \\( \\frac{As + B}{s^2 + s + 1} \\) corresponds to the system response without the disturbance.\n   - The term \\( \\frac{C}{s - \\lambda} \\) corresponds to the effect of the disturbance \\( e^{\\lambda t} \\).\n\n7. **Uniqueness of Disturbance Identification**: The presence of the term \\( \\frac{C}{s - \\lambda} \\) means that the effect of the disturbance \\( d(t) = e^{\\lambda t} \\) is uniquely identifiable in the Laplace domain. However, without knowing \\( \\lambda \\), we cannot directly identify the exact value of \\( \\lambda \\) from \\( z(t) \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**: While the disturbance \\( d(t) \\) can be identified in principle, determining the specific value of \\( \\lambda \\) requires additional information beyond just observing \\( z(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is that it is not possible to conclusively trace back to determine the exact value of \\( \\lambda \\) without prior knowledge of \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To address this problem, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the System Dynamics**:\n   - The system has a transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\).\n   - The disturbance \\( d(t) = e^{\\lambda t} \\) is applied to the system.\n   \n2. **Determine the Output Response**:\n   - The Laplace transform of the disturbance \\( d(t) \\) is \\( D(s) = \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda} \\).\n   - The output \\( Z(s) \\) in the Laplace domain can be found using the relationship \\( Z(s) = H(s)D(s) \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Output in Laplace Domain**:\n   - Substitute \\( H(s) \\) and \\( D(s) \\):\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda} = \\frac{s}{(s^2 + s + 1)(s - \\lambda)}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Analyze the Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - To determine if we can trace back from \\( z(t) \\) to \\( \\lambda \\), we need to consider the inverse Laplace transform of \\( Z(s) \\).\n   - The exact form of \\( z(t) \\) will depend on the roots of the denominator polynomial \\( (s^2 + s + 1)(s - \\lambda) \\).\n\n5. **Implications for Tracing Back**:\n   - The term \\( e^{\\lambda t} \\) in the disturbance directly contributes to the output \\( z(t) \\) in the time domain.\n   - However, the presence of \\( e^{\\lambda t} \\) alone does not uniquely identify \\( \\lambda \\) because other components of \\( z(t) \\) also depend on \\( \\lambda \\).\n   - Without additional information about the initial conditions or other disturbances, it is not possible to conclusively determine \\( \\lambda \\) just from observing \\( z(t) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given only the output \\( z(t) \\), it is not possible to conclusively determine the value of \\( \\lambda \\) without additional information.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can conclusively trace back from the output \\( z(t) \\) to determine whether the disturbance \\( d(t) \\) was introduced, let's analyze the system step by step.\n\n1. **System Description**:\n   - The output function \\( z(t) \\) is given by the transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\).\n   - The disturbance function is \\( d(t) = e^{\\lambda t} \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Analysis**:\n   - The Laplace transform of the disturbance function \\( d(t) \\) is \\( D(s) = \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda} \\).\n   - The output \\( Z(s) \\) in the Laplace domain can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = H(s) \\cdot D(s) = \\frac{s}{s^2 + s + 1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s - \\lambda}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = \\frac{s}{(s^2 + s + 1)(s - \\lambda)}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Inversion to Time Domain**:\n   - To find \\( z(t) \\) in the time domain, we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( Z(s) \\). However, the presence of \\( \\lambda \\) complicates the direct inversion because it depends on the specific value of \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n4. **Analysis of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - The exact form of \\( z(t) \\) will depend on the value of \\( \\lambda \\). Different values of \\( \\lambda \\) will result in different time-domain responses.\n   - Without knowing \\( \\lambda \\), we cannot uniquely determine the source of the disturbance from \\( z(t) \\) alone. The response could be due to other factors or disturbances that have similar characteristics in the frequency domain.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the output \\( z(t) \\) is influenced by the unknown parameter \\( \\lambda \\), it is not possible to conclusively determine whether the disturbance \\( d(t) \\) was introduced based solely on \\( z(t) \\) without additional information about \\( \\lambda \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
