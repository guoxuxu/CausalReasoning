    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial State**: The initial state of the system is given by \\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\). Here, \\( C \\) and \\( \\omega \\) are constants, and \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit.\n\n2. **Transformation \\( f(z) = z^2 \\)**: If \\( f(z) = z^2 \\) is applied, then:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = (Ce^{i\\omega t})^2 = C^2 e^{i2\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   This transformation changes the state of the system from \\( z(t) \\) to \\( z(t)^2 \\).\n\n3. **Transformation \\( g(z) = \\sqrt{z} \\)**: If \\( g(z) = \\sqrt{z} \\) is applied at a later time \\( t_1 \\), then:\n   \\[\n   z(t_1) = C e^{i\\omega t_1}\n   \\]\n   Applying \\( g(z) \\) to \\( z(t_1) \\):\n   \\[\n   g(z(t_1)) = \\sqrt{C e^{i\\omega t_1}} = \\sqrt{C} e^{i\\omega t_1 / 2}\n   \\]\n   Note that the square root function has two branches, but we consider one specific branch here.\n\n4. **Final State \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\)**: After applying \\( g(z) \\), the state evolves further under the original dynamics \\( z(t) = Ce^{i\\omega t} \\). For \\( T > t_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = \\left(\\sqrt{C} e^{i\\omega t_1 / 2}\\right)e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} = \\sqrt{C} e^{i\\omega t_1 / 2} e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} = \\sqrt{C} e^{i\\omega (t_1 + T - t_1)/2} e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} = \\sqrt{C} e^{i\\omega T/2} e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = \\sqrt{C} e^{i\\omega T/2} e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} = \\sqrt{C} e^{i\\omega T/2} e^{i\\omega T - i\\omega t_1} = \\sqrt{C} e^{i\\omega T/2} e^{i\\omega T} e^{-i\\omega t_1} = \\sqrt{C} e^{i\\omega T/2} C e^{i\\omega t_1} e^{-i\\omega t_1} = \\sqrt{C} C e^{i\\omega T/2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The final state \\( z(T) \\) depends on \\( \\omega \\) and \\( C \\), but it does not depend on the specific transformations \\( f(z) \\) and \\( g(z) \\) beyond their initial application. The dependency on \\( \\omega \\) is consistent with the original form of the function.\n\nTherefore, the final state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends solely on \\( \\omega \\) and not on the transformations \\( f(z) \\) or \\( g(z) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
