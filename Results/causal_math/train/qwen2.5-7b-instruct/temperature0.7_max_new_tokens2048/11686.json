Without knowing \\( A \\), we cannot isolate \\( v \\) because the exponential term \\( e^{(A - i\\omega)t} \\) is inherently linked to \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the given problem step by step.\n\n1. **Given Function**: We have \\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\), where \\( A \\) is a matrix and \\( v \\) is a complex constant vector.\n2. **Fourier Transformation**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n3. **Substitute \\( z(t) \\)**: Substitute \\( z(t) = e^{At}v \\) into the Fourier transform definition:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t} e^{At} v \\, dt\n   \\]\n4. **Simplify the Integral**: This can be simplified to:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = v \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(A - i\\omega) t} \\, dt\n   \\]\n5. **Convergence Consideration**: For the integral to converge, \\( A - i\\omega \\) must have all eigenvalues with negative real parts (for exponential decay). However, let's assume this condition holds for now.\n6. **Evaluate the Integral**: The integral evaluates to:\n   \\[\n   \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{(A - i\\omega) t} \\, dt = \\frac{1}{\\det(I - (A - i\\omega)^{-1})} \\quad \\text{(assuming the integral converges)}\n   \\]\n7. **Expression for \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\)**: Therefore, we get:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = v \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\det(I - (A - i\\omega)^{-1})}\n   \\]\n\nFrom the above expression, it is clear that \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) depends on \\( v \\) but also involves the matrix \\( A \\) through the determinant term. Without knowing \\( A \\), we cannot directly isolate \\( v \\) from \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\).\n\nTherefore, the original vector \\( v \\) cannot be precisely determined from \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\) without additional information about the matrix \\( A \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\": \"No\"}"
