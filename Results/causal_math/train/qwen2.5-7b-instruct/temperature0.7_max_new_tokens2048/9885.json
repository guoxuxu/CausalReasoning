    "To analyze whether the integral \\(\\int_C z(w) dw\\) changes under the given conditions, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define the Initial Integral**: The initial integral we are considering is \\(\\int_C z(w) dw\\), where \\(z(w) = w^2 + 2iw\\).\n\n2. **Transformation Application**: The transformation \\(T(w) = e^{iw}w\\) is applied to each point \\(w\\) on the contour \\(C\\). This means that every point \\(w\\) on the contour is mapped to a new point \\(w' = T(w)\\). However, this transformation does not change the contour \\(C\\) itself; it only maps points on \\(C\\) to new locations.\n\n3. **Effect of Transformation on the Integral**: Since \\(C\\) remains a closed contour in the \\(w'\\)-plane after applying the transformation \\(T(w)\\), the integral \\(\\int_C z(w) dw\\) should remain unchanged because the contour \\(C\\) is simply being reparameterized. The integral of a function over a closed contour depends on the contour and the function, but not on the parameterization of the contour. In other words, if we reparameterize the contour using \\(w' = T(w)\\), the integral becomes \\(\\int_{C'} z(T^{-1}(w')) dT^{-1}(w')\\), where \\(C'\\) is the image of \\(C\\) under \\(T\\). However, since \\(T\\) is a bijection (one-to-one and onto) on the complex plane, the integral remains the same.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The integral \\(\\int_C z(w) dw\\) does not change when the contour \\(C\\) is transformed by \\(T(w)\\) and then evolved under \\(z(w)\\) without further intervention.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**:\n   - The transformation \\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\) maps each point \\( w \\) in the complex plane to a new point.\n   - This transformation is non-trivial and involves both a rotation (due to \\( e^{iw} \\)) and a scaling (due to \\( w \\)).\n\n2. **Effect on Contour \\( C \\)**:\n   - When we apply \\( T(w) \\) to the contour \\( C \\), the shape and position of \\( C \\) will change.\n   - The new contour, say \\( C' \\), will not necessarily be the same as \\( C \\).\n\n3. **Integral Consideration**:\n   - The integral \\( \\int_C z(w) dw \\) depends on the path \\( C \\) and the function \\( z(w) \\).\n   - If \\( C \\) changes to \\( C' \\), the integral might change because the path of integration has changed.\n\n4. **Complex Function \\( z(w) \\)**:\n   - \\( z(w) = w^2 + 2iw \\) is an analytic function (holomorphic) in the entire complex plane.\n   - For an analytic function, if the contour \\( C \\) is closed and simple (no self-intersections), the integral over any closed contour is zero due to Cauchy's theorem.\n\n5. **Transformation Impact**:\n   - Even though the contour changes, if \\( C \\) remains a closed contour, the integral over \\( C \\) should still be zero due to Cauchy's theorem, assuming no singularities are introduced inside \\( C \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The transformation \\( T(w) \\) changes the contour \\( C \\) to \\( C' \\).\n   - However, since \\( z(w) \\) is analytic and \\( C \\) remains a closed contour, the integral \\( \\int_{C'} z(w) dw \\) will still be zero.\n\nGiven that the integral over a closed contour for an analytic function does not change under such transformations, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To address this question, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation \\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\) maps points from the \\( w \\)-plane to another point in the \\( w \\)-plane. This transformation involves both a phase shift (due to \\( e^{iw} \\)) and a scaling (due to \\( w \\)).\n\n2. **Impact on Contour \\( C \\)**: When we apply \\( T(w) \\) to a contour \\( C \\), the new contour \\( C' \\) in the transformed space will be the image of \\( C \\) under this transformation. However, the original contour \\( C \\) in the \\( w \\)-plane remains unchanged; only the mapping of points on \\( C \\) into the \\( w \\)-plane changes.\n\n3. **Integral Consideration**: The integral \\(\\int_C z(w) dw\\) is computed along the original contour \\( C \\) in the \\( w \\)-plane.

If \\( C \\) is deformed but still forms a closed contour, the integral might change due to the deformation, but the problem statement does not specify any deformation of \\( C \\) other than the initial mapping by \\( T(w) \\).\n\nGiven these considerations, the integral \\( \\int_C z(w) dw \\) does not necessarily change just because the points on \\( C \\) are initially transformed by \\( T(w) \\). The integral depends on the path \\( C \\) and the function \\( z(w) \\), and since no further deformation of \\( C \\) is specified, the integral remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To address this problem, we need to analyze how the transformation \\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\) affects the contour \\( C \\) and subsequently the integral \\( \\int_C z(w) dw \\).\n\n1. **Transformation Analysis**:\n   - The transformation \\( T(w) = e^{iw}w \\) maps points in the complex plane.\n   - This transformation is not a simple linear transformation but involves both scaling and rotation due to the exponential term \\( e^{iw} \\).\n   - The effect of \\( T(w) \\) on a point \\( w \\) is to rotate it around the origin by an angle proportional to its argument and scale it by its magnitude.\n\n2. **Effect on Contour \\( C \\)**:\n   - When \\( T(w) \\) is applied to every point on the contour \\( C \\), the new contour \\( C' \\) will be deformed based on the transformation properties.\n   - However, the key aspect here is that the transformation \\( T(w) \\) does not change the topology of the contour \\( C \\); it only deforms it continuously.\n\n3. **Integral Invariance**:\n   - The integral \\( \\int_C z(w) dw \\) depends on the path \\( C \\) and the function \\( z(w) \\).\n   - For a closed contour \\( C \\) and a complex function \\( z(w) \\), if the function \\( z(w) \\) is analytic (holomorphic) inside and on \\( C \\), then by Cauchy's Integral Theorem, the integral is zero.\n   - If \\( z(w) \\) is not holomorphic, the integral can still be evaluated using other methods like the residue theorem, but the transformation \\( T(w) \\) does not inherently change the value of the integral unless it changes the function \\( z(w) \\) itself or the path \\( C \\) in a way that affects the integrand.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since \\( T(w) \\) only deforms the contour \\( C \\) and does not change the function \\( z(w) \\) or introduce any singularities that would affect the integral's value, the integral \\( \\int_C z(w) dw \\) remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the integral \\( \\int_C z(w) dw \\) will not change after applying the transformation \\( T(w) \\) to the contour \\( C \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
