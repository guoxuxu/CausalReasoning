For a sinusoidal input, the solution will be:\n   \\[\n   q(t) = \\frac{V_0}{\\sqrt{\\omega^2 C^2}} \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\phi\\) is the phase shift.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The charge \\(q(t)\\) in the steady-state will be a cosine function of time with a frequency \\(\\omega\\). The amplitude of the charge depends on both \\(\\omega\\) and the capacitance \\(C\\), but the frequency \\(\\omega\\) is the key parameter that determines the oscillation frequency.\n\nTherefore, the charge on the capacitor \\(q(t)\\) for large \\(t\\) will indeed depend on the frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Equation Analysis**: The differential equation given is \\(\\frac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 q = 0\\). This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation, which describes simple harmonic motion.\n\n2. **External Sinusoidal Voltage Source**: The external voltage source is \\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\). When a sinusoidal voltage source is applied to a capacitor, the resulting current and charge will also be sinusoidal, but they will have a phase shift relative to the voltage.\n\n3. **Solution Form**: For a sinusoidal input \\(V(t) = V_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\), the solution for the charge \\(q(t)\\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   q(t) = Q_0 e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   where \\(Q_0\\) is a complex constant that depends on the initial conditions and the system parameters (in this case, \\(\\omega\\)).\n\n4. **Dependence on Frequency**: The solution \\(q(t) = Q_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\) shows that the charge on the capacitor is indeed dependent on the frequency \\(\\omega\\). Specifically, the frequency \\(\\omega\\) determines the angular frequency of the oscillatory behavior of the charge.\n\n5. **Long-Term Behavior**: For large \\(t\\), the exponential term \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\) will continue to oscillate with the same frequency \\(\\omega\\). Therefore, the long-term behavior of the charge \\(q(t)\\) will still depend on \\(\\omega\\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, the charge on the capacitor \\(q(t)\\) for large \\(t\\) will indeed depend on the frequency \\(\\omega\\).\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
