    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) is a complex exponential with a constant angular frequency \\( \\omega \\). This represents a pure sinusoidal wave in the time domain.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega t} e^{i \\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dt\n   \\]\n   However, this integral does not converge as written because it is integrating over all time. Instead, let's consider the correct form for the Fourier transform of a complex exponential:\n   \\[\n   F(z)(\\omega') = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega' t} e^{i \\omega t} dt = \\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function, which indicates that the Fourier transform of \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\) is a single impulse at \\( \\omega' = \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Interpretation of Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\( F(z)(\\omega) = \\delta(\\omega - \\omega') \\) shows that the original signal \\( z(t) = e^{i \\omega t} \\) has all its energy concentrated at a single frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n4. **Phase Shifts and Operations**: If there were any phase shifts or other linear time-invariant (LTI) operations applied to \\( z(t) \\) in the time domain, these would be represented by multiplication with another complex exponential or a linear combination of exponentials. For example, a phase shift would result in \\( z(t) = e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi)} \\), and its Fourier transform would still be a single impulse at \\( \\omega \\) but scaled by a complex factor.\n\n5. **Analysis of Fourier Transform**: When analyzing \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\), we see a single impulse at \\( \\omega \\). This indicates no additional phase shifts or other linear operations were applied beyond the initial \\( e^{i \\omega t} \\). Any phase shift would manifest as a different frequency component or a change in the amplitude of the impulse, but since we only see one impulse, no phase shifts or other operations were introduced.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of \\( F(z)(\\omega) \\), we can conclude that no phase shifts or similar operations were applied during the transition from the time-domain.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}",
