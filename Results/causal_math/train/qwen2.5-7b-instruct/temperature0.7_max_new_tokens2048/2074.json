    "To determine if we can always uniquely recover the original function \\( g(t) \\) from the transformed function \\( G(z) \\) using the inverse Laplace transform, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The given transformation is \\( G(z) = \\int e^{tz} g(t) dt \\). This looks similar to the Laplace transform, but with the roles of \\( z \\) and \\( t \\) reversed. Typically, the Laplace transform is defined as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} g(t) dt \\).\n\n2. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: The inverse Laplace transform is generally defined for functions that are analytic in the right half-plane (or a region containing the positive real axis) and satisfy certain growth conditions. If \\( G(z) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\), then the inverse Laplace transform should recover \\( g(t) \\) as:\n   \\[\n   g(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\int_{c-iT}^{c+iT} G(z) e^{zt} dz,\n   \\]\n   where \\( c \\) is chosen such that all singularities of \\( G(z) \\) lie to the left of the line \\( \\text{Re}(z) = c \\).\n\n3. **Uniqueness of Inversion**: For the inverse Laplace transform to be unique, \\( G(z) \\) must be the Laplace transform of some function \\( g(t) \\). However, there can be multiple functions whose Laplace transforms are the same in the region of interest. This is known as the \"inverse uniqueness\" issue in Laplace transform theory.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Given Transformation**: The given transformation \\( G(z) = \\int e^{tz} g(t) dt \\) does not necessarily correspond to a standard Laplace transform because it integrates over a different variable and uses \\( e^{tz} \\) instead of \\( e^{-st} \\). This means that \\( G(z) \\) might not be a Laplace transform in the conventional sense, and thus, the usual properties of the inverse Laplace transform may not apply directly.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about the nature of \\( G(z) \\) and the function \\( g(t) \\), we cannot guarantee that the inverse Laplace transform will uniquely recover \\( g(t) \\). There could be multiple functions \\( g(t) \\) that map to the same \\( G(z) \\) under this transformation.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The given transformation is \\( G(z) = \\int e^{tz} g(t) dt \\). This looks similar to the definition of the Laplace transform, but with \\( z \\) as the variable in the exponent instead of \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Inversion Process**: To recover \\( g(t) \\) from \\( G(z) \\), we would typically use the inverse Laplace transform. However, the standard inverse Laplace transform assumes that \\( z \\) is real and positive (or in some cases, purely imaginary), which is not the case here since \\( z \\) is a complex variable.\n\n3. **Complex Analysis Considerations**: For the inverse Laplace transform to be valid in the complex domain, we need to consider the Bromwich contour, which is a vertical line in the complex plane. However, the given transformation involves integrating along a different contour in the complex plane, which complicates matters.\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Inversion**: The uniqueness of the inverse Laplace transform relies on the properties of the Bromwich contour and the fact that the integral converges in a certain region of the complex plane. When \\( z \\) is complex, the convergence and uniqueness of the inverse transform become more problematic.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the complexity introduced by having \\( z \\) as a complex variable, it is not guaranteed that we can always uniquely recover \\( g(t) \\) from \\( G(z) \\) using the inverse Laplace transform.

However, the standard form of the inverse Laplace transform involves an integral along a vertical line in the complex plane, not an indefinite integral as given here.\n\n3. **Uniqueness of Inversion**: For the inverse Laplace transform to uniquely recover \\( g(t) \\), certain conditions must be met, such as \\( g(t) \\) being piecewise continuous and of exponential order. These conditions ensure that the Laplace transform is well-defined and that the inverse exists.\n\n4. **Issues with the Given Form**: The form \\( G(z) = \\int e^{tz} g(t) dt \\) suggests an indefinite integral, which doesn't align with the standard definition of the Laplace transform. Moreover, without specifying a contour for the integral, it's ambiguous and could lead to different interpretations.\n\n5. **Contour Integration**: In the context of the Laplace transform, the integral is typically evaluated along a specific contour (often a vertical line) in the complex plane. Without this specification, the transformation \\( G(z) \\) does not clearly correspond to a known transform.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the ambiguity in the definition of \\( G(z) \\) and the lack of a clear contour, we cannot guarantee that the inverse process will uniquely recover \\( g(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
