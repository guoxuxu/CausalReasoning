    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We have a function \\(z(t)\\) that evolves over time \\(t\\) according to an integral equation involving a kernel function \\(K(s)\\).

However, this state has been modified by the intervention function.\n\n4. **Reversing the Intervention**: To find the initial state \\(z_0\\), we need to reverse the effect of the intervention function.
