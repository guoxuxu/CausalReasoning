    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We have a function \\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\), where \\( a > 0 \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Definition**: The Fourier Transform \\( G(f) \\) of \\( g(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   G(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-at^2} e^{-i2\\pi ft} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Properties of the Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier Transform is a linear operator.\n   - The Fourier Transform of a Gaussian function \\( e^{-at^2} \\) is another Gaussian function.\n   - Specifically, for \\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\), the Fourier Transform \\( G(f) \\) is:\n     \\[\n     G(f) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}} e^{-\\frac{f^2}{4a}}\n     \\]\n   - This result comes from known Fourier transform pairs and properties of Gaussian functions.\n\n4. **Time Evolution**: The problem asks if \\( G(f) \\) remains constant over time after being transformed and then evolved under normal Fourier properties. However, the Fourier Transform itself does not introduce any time evolution; it is a static transformation from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\n5. **Causality and Reverse Causality**:\n   - Applying the Fourier Transform to \\( g(t) \\) results in \\( G(f) \\).\n   - Evolving \\( G(f) \\) under normal Fourier properties would mean applying the inverse Fourier Transform back to the time domain, which would yield \\( g(t) \\) again.\n   - There is no inherent time evolution in the Fourier Transform process itself.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since the Fourier Transform does not introduce time evolution, \\( G(f) \\) does not change over time once it has been computed. It is a fixed function of frequency.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether \\( G(f) \\) at a frequency \\( f \\) will remain constant over time is \"Yes\".\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
