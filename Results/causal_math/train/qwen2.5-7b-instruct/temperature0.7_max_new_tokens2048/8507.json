Here, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are scalar constants.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{z}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i\\omega t}z(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This transform converts the time-domain representation of \\(z(t)\\) into a frequency-domain representation.\n\n3. **Intervention**: An intervention is introduced where \\(z(t)\\) is scaled by \\(s(t) = e^{Ct}\\) at a specific time \\(t_1\\). This means that for \\(t \\geq t_1\\), the new state of \\(z(t)\\) becomes \\(z(t) \\cdot e^{C(t - t_1)}\\).\n\n4. **Impact on Differential Equations**:\n   - For \\(t < t_1\\), the original differential equations \\(\\dot{x} = Ax\\) and \\(\\dot{y} = By\\) hold.\n   - For \\(t \\geq t_1\\), the differential equations become \\(\\dot{x} = A(x + Ce^{C(t-t_1)x})\\) and \\(\\dot{y} = B(y + Ce^{C(t-t_1)y})\\). However, since \\(e^{C(t-t_1)}\\) is a multiplicative factor, it affects both the initial conditions and the dynamics of \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\).\n\n5. **Fourier Transform Impact**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\(z(t) \\cdot e^{C(t - t_1)}\\) will include the effect of the scaling factor \\(e^{C(t - t_1)}\\).\n   - Specifically, the Fourier transform of \\(e^{C(t - t_1)}\\) is a shifted delta function in the frequency domain, which modifies the original \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) by shifting its phase and amplitude.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The Fourier transform \\(\\hat{z}(\\omega)\\) will reflect not only the impacts of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) but also the impact of \\(C\\), due to the introduction of the scaling factor \\(e^{C(t - t_1)}\\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
