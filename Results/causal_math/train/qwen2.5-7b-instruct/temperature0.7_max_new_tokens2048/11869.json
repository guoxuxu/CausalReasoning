    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Heat Equation**: The heat equation \\( u_t = k u_{xx} \\) describes how the temperature \\( u \\) changes over time \\( t \\) due to diffusion. It assumes that the rate of change of temperature at any point is proportional to the second spatial derivative of the temperature at that point.\n\n2. **Initial Condition**: We are given an initial condition \\( u(x,0) = f(x) = e^{-x^2} \\).
