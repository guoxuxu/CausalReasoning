    "To determine if we can uniquely determine the initial conditions \\( u(0) \\) and \\( v(0) \\) from the transformed function \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\) at some later time \\( T \\), let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the System**: We have a complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\) which satisfies the second-order differential equation \\( \\ddot{z} + \\omega^2 z = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} \\).

This is because the inverse Laplace transform would require knowing the poles and residues, which depend on the specific form of \\( Z(s) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since \\( Z(s) \\) alone does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the initial conditions \\( u(0) \\) and \\( v(0) \\), the answer is no.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
