    "To determine whether we can reconstruct the functions \\(u(x, y)\\) and \\(v(x, y)\\) exactly from the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{w(t)\\}\\) without knowing the transformation \\(T\\), let's analyze the situation step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation \\(T(x, y) = (u(x, y), v(x, y))\\) maps a point \\((x, y)\\) in the \\(xy\\)-plane to a point \\((u, v)\\) in the \\(uv\\)-plane. Specifically, \\(u(x, y) = 2x + 3y\\) and \\(v(x, y) = 5x - 4y\\).\n\n2. **Expressing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in Terms of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\)**: We need to find out if there is a unique way to express \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). This involves solving the system of linear equations:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{cases}\n   u = 2x + 3y \\\\\n   v = 5x - 4y\n   \\end{cases}\n   \\]\n   This system can be solved using matrix methods or substitution. Solving it, we get:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{4u + 3v}{23}, \\quad y = \\frac{5u - 2v}{23}\n   \\]\n   These expressions show that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) can indeed be uniquely determined from \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).\n\n3. **Reconstructing \\(u\\) and \\(v\\)**: Since \\(u(x, y) = 2x + 3y\\) and \\(v(x, y) = 5x - 4y\\), substituting the expressions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) into these equations will give us the original functions \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) directly. Therefore, we can reconstruct \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) exactly from the values of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).\n\n4. **Role of the Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{w(t)\\}\\) provides information about the function \\(w(t)\\) in the frequency domain. However, since we already know the explicit forms of \\(u(x, y)\\) and \\(v(x, y)\\) in terms of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), and we have a method to express \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in terms of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), the Laplace transform does not add any additional information necessary to reconstruct \\(u\\) and \\(v\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, we conclude that the Laplace transform \\(\\mathcal{L}\\{w(t)\\}\\) alone, without knowing the transformation \\(T\\), is not sufficient to reconstruct the functions \\(u(x, y)\\) and \\(v(x, y)\\) exactly because the relationship between \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) and the original variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is already known through the given linear transformations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```",
