If \\( \\sigma \\neq 0 \\), then the Laplace transform contains information that is not present in the Fourier transform.\n\nGiven that the Laplace transform includes the decay rate, if the original function \\( g(t) \\) was only subjected to a Fourier transform, the resulting \\( G(f) \\) would lack the information about any exponential decay or growth. However, once a Laplace transform is applied, even if the original function was just a simple time-domain signal without exponential terms, the presence of \\( \\sigma \\) in \\( s \\) will be evident in \\( G(s) \\).\n\nTherefore, by examining the final transformed state \\( G(s) \\), we can indeed identify whether the Laplace transform was applied, as its characteristic form (involving \\( \\sigma \\)) will be present, whereas the Fourier transform \\( G(f) \\) would not capture this additional information.\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
