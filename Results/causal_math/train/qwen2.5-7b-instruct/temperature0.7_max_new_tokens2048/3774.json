As time progresses, \\( G(k) \\) modifies the amplitude of the spatial frequencies.\n\n5. **Determining \\( G(k) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\)**: To determine if \\( G(k) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) with absolute certainty, we need to consider whether the presence of \\( G(k) \\) can be uniquely identified from \\( \\hat{U}(k,t) \\) alone. Since \\( G(k) \\) modifies the amplitude of the spatial frequencies over time, the presence of \\( G(k) \\) would leave a signature in \\( \\hat{U}(k,t) \\) that persists as \\( t \\) increases. However, knowing only \\( \\lambda \\) (and thus \\( k \\)) does not provide enough information to distinguish between the effect of \\( G(k) \\) being applied at \\( t = 0 \\) versus some other initial condition or evolution that could produce a similar \\( \\hat{U}(k,t) \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the analysis, we cannot determine with absolute certainty whether \\( G(k) \\) was applied at \\( t = 0 \\) just by knowing \\( \\lambda \\) and observing \\( \\hat{U}(k,t) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
