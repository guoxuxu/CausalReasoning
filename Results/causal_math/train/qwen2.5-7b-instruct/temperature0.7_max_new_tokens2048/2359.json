Applying \\( U \\) to this state gives:\n   \\[\n   U(A e^{i\\omega t_1} + B) = D(A e^{i\\omega t_1} + B) + E = DA e^{i\\omega t_1} + DB + E\n   \\]\n\n5. **State at Time T**: The state at any time \\( T > t_1 \\) would be determined by the transformed state at \\( t_1 \\) and the subsequent evolution according to \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). Therefore, the state at \\( T \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} \\cdot (DA e^{i\\omega t_1} + DB + E)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} \\cdot DA e^{i\\omega t_1} + e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} \\cdot (DB + E) = DA e^{i\\omega T} + e^{i\\omega (T - t_1)} (DB + E)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**: From the expression above, we can see that the state \\( z(T) \\) at time \\( T \\) depends on \\( \\omega \\), \\( A \\), \\( D \\), \\( B \\), and \\( E \\). Specifically, the term \\( DA e^{i\\omega T} \\) shows that the dependency on \\( \\omega \\) and \\( A \\) is clear, but the presence of \\( D \\), \\( B \\), and \\( E \\) indicates that these parameters also influence the state.\n\nTherefore, the state \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) does depend on \\( \\omega \\) but also on \\( A \\), \\( B \\), \\( D \\), and \\( E \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"No\"}"
