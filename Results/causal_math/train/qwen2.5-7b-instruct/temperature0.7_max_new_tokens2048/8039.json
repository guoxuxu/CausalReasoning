This describes how the state \\(z\\) evolves over time, where \\(p\\) is a constant parameter.\n\n2. **Transformation at Time \\(t_1\\)**: At time \\(t_1\\), we apply a new transformation \\(k(z) = z^2\\). This means that the state \\(z(t)\\) at time \\(t_1\\) becomes \\(z(t_1)^2\\).\n\n3. **Continued Evolution**: After \\(t_1\\), the state continues to evolve according to the original differential equation \\(\\dot{z} = pz\\). Since the transformation only affects the state at \\(t_1\\), it does not change the form of the differential equation after \\(t_1\\).\n\n4. **Final State Analysis**:\n   - Before \\(t_1\\), the state evolves as \\(z(t) = z(0)e^{pt}\\).\n   - At \\(t = t_1\\), the state is transformed to \\(z(t_1)^2\\).\n   - After \\(t_1\\), the state continues to evolve as \\(z(t) = z(t_1)^2 e^{p(t-t_1)}\\).\n\n5. **Final State at \\(T > t_1\\)**: The final state \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) is given by \\(z(T) = z(t_1)^2 e^{p(T-t_1)}\\).\n\n6. **Dependency Check**:\n   - The final state \\(z(T)\\) depends on \\(z(t_1)\\), which is influenced by the initial condition and the parameter \\(p\\).\n   - The transformation \\(k(z) = z^2\\) only affects \\(z(t_1)\\) but does not alter the form of the evolution equation.\n   - The parameter \\(q\\) in the function \\(h(z) = \\sin(qz)\\) does not appear in the differential equation or the transformation process described, so it does not affect the final state \\(z(T)\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the final state \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) depends exclusively on the parameter \\(p\\) and not on \\(q\\) or the details of the transformation \\(k(z)\\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
