This could involve passing the signal through a filter that allows only certain frequencies to pass while attenuating others. The nature of the filter and the specific frequencies it allows or attenuates can vary.\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: After applying the Fourier transform and potentially a filtering process, we obtain a modified frequency-domain representation.
