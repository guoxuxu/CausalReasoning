  "Ground Truth": "no",
  "Explanation": "Changing the parameter b directly affects the exponent term in the integral defining z(w). Even a slight modification in b alters the rate of growth/decay within the integrand, and thereby the computed output of z(w) is invariably influenced.",

For the integral to remain unchanged, the integrand must not change. However, since the exponent in the integrand (which determines the shape of the function being integrated) has changed due to the change in \\(b\\), the value of the integral will generally change.\n\n5. **Causal Influence**: The change in \\(b\\) directly influences the form of the integrand, which in turn affects the value of the integral.
