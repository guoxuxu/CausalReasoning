    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have a continuous dynamical system with a function \\( u(t) \\) that is transformed into \\( U(s) \\) using the Laplace transform.\n2. **Intervention**: At a specific time \\( t_1 \\), there is an intervention that modifies the function from \\( u(t) \\) to \\( u(t)e^{bt} \\), where \\( b \\) is a real constant.\n3. **Effect on Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of a modified function \\( u(t)e^{bt} \\) can be found using the time-shifting property of the Laplace transform.
