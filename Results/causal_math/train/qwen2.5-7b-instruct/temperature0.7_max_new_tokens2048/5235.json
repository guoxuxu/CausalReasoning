This means that the evolution of \\(z(t)\\) depends solely on the constant \\(k\\) and the initial condition \\(z(0)\\).\n\n3. **Linear Transformation \\(M\\)**: The matrix \\(M\\) is applied to the components \\((x, y)\\) of \\(z\\). However, since the PDE is linear and homogeneous, any linear transformation applied to the components will be \"absorbed\" into the initial condition. In other words, if we apply \\(M\\) to \\((x, y)\\) at \\(t=0\\), it will affect \\(z(0)\\) but not the form of the solution after that point.

However, the subsequent evolution of \\(z(t)\\) for \\(t > t_1\\) still follows the same form \\(z(t) = e^{-k(t-t_1)}Nz(t_1)\\). The key point here is that the exponential term \\(e^{-k(t-t_1)}\\) is determined by \\(k\\) alone, and the effect of \\(N\\) is just a change in the initial condition at \\(t_1\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The state of \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) depends on \\(k\\) because the exponential term \\(e^{-k(T-t_1)}\\) determines the decay rate. It also depends on \\(Nz(t_1)\\), which is the result of the intervention at \\(t_1\\), but this is just a change in the initial condition.

Specifically, \\( z(t) = z(t_1) e^{-k(t-t_1)} \\).\n\n3. **Role of Matrices \\( M \\) and \\( N \\)**:\n   - Matrix \\( M \\) transforms \\( (x, y) \\) into \\( (x', y') \\) but does not affect the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) as described by the PDE. This is because the transformation only changes the form of \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), but the overall solution \\( z(t) \\) is still governed by the same PDE with \\( k \\).\n   - Matrix \\( N \\) is applied at \\( t_1 \\) and affects \\( (x, y) \\) at and after \\( t_1 \\). However, since \\( z(t) \\) is determined by the initial conditions and the PDE, the transformation by \\( N \\) will change the initial conditions for \\( z(t) \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\). Therefore, \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will be influenced by \\( N \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The state of \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) depends on both \\( k \\) and the transformations by \\( M \\) and \\( N \\). Specifically, the effect of \\( N \\) is crucial for \\( T > t_1 \\), and \\( M \\) affects the initial conditions before \\( t_1 \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
