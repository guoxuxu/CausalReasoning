    "To determine if the resultant signal \\( h(t) \\) only depends on the properties of \\( G(s) \\) and not on the original signal \\( g(t) \\), let's analyze the given transformations step-by-step.\n\n1. **Original Signal to Laplace Transform:**\n   - The original signal \\( g(t) \\) is transformed into \\( G(s) \\) via the Laplace transform:\n     \\[\n     G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s)\n     \\]\n\n2. **Multiplication in the Complex Domain:**\n   - The function \\( G(s) \\) is then multiplied by \\( s \\):\n     \\[\n     H(s) = sG(s)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform:**\n   - The modified function \\( H(s) \\) is transformed back into the time domain to obtain \\( h(t) \\):\n     \\[\n     h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\}\n     \\]\n\nNow, we need to understand how \\( h(t) \\) is related to \\( G(s) \\).\n\n- By definition, the inverse Laplace transform of \\( H(s) = sG(s) \\) can be expressed as:\n  \\[\n  h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{sG(s)\\}\n  \\]\n\n- Using the time-domain differentiation property of the Laplace transform, which states that:\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{L}\\{t \\cdot g(t)\\}(s) = -\\frac{dG(s)}{ds}\n  \\]\n  and knowing that:\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{sG(s)\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\mathcal{L}\\{g(t)\\}(s) \\cdot s\\right\\} = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{-\\frac{dG(s)}{ds}\\right\\}\n  \\]\n\n- Therefore:\n  \\[\n  h(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt}g(t)\n  \\]\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the resultant signal \\( h(t) \\) directly depends on the derivative of the original signal \\( g(t) \\).
