    "Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Convolution with Gaussian Kernel**: The function \\( p(x) \\) is convolved with a Gaussian kernel \\( G(x; \\sigma) \\). This operation can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   p_{new}(x) = (p * G)(x)\n   \\]\n   where \\( * \\) denotes convolution.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Properties**: The Fourier transform of a convolution of two functions is the product of their individual Fourier transforms. Therefore, the Fourier transform of \\( p_{new}(x) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{p_{new}(x)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{(p * G)(x)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{p(x)\\} \\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{G(x; \\sigma)\\}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of Gaussian**: The Fourier transform of a Gaussian function \\( G(x; \\sigma) \\) is another Gaussian function:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{G(x; \\sigma)\\} = e^{-\\pi^2 \\sigma^2 \\xi^2}\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\xi \\) is the frequency variable.\n\n4. **Determining the Original Function**: Given the Fourier transform of \\( p_{new}(x) \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{p_{new}(x)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{p(x)\\} \\cdot e^{-\\pi^2 \\sigma^2 \\xi^2}\n   \\]\n   To find \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{p(x)\\} \\), we would need to divide both sides by the Fourier transform of the Gaussian:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}\\{p(x)\\} = \\frac{\\mathcal{F}\\{p_{new}(x)\\}}{e^{-\\pi^2 \\sigma^2 \\xi^2}}\n   \\]\n   However, this division requires knowledge of \\( \\sigma \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Without knowing the value of \\( \\sigma \\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{p(x)\\} \\) from \\( \\mathcal{F}\\{p_{new}(x)\\} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
