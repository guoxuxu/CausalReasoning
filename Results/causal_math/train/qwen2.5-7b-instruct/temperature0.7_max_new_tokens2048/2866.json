    "To determine whether we can separate \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) from their Laplace transforms \\( U(s) \\) and \\( V(s) \\) using the inverse Laplace transform, let's reason through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Given Information**:\n   - The complex function \\( z(t) = u(t) + iv(t) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is \\( Z(s) = L[z(t)] \\).\n   - The Laplace transforms of \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) are \\( U(s) = L[u(t)] \\) and \\( V(s) = L[v(t)] \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of Complex Functions**:\n   - The Laplace transform of a sum is the sum of the Laplace transforms:\n     \\[\n     Z(s) = L[z(t)] = L[u(t) + iv(t)] = L[u(t)] + iL[v(t)] = U(s) + iV(s)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**:\n   - The inverse Laplace transform is used to recover the original function from its Laplace transform.\n   - If we have \\( Z(s) = U(s) + iV(s) \\), applying the inverse Laplace transform to both sides would give us:\n     \\[\n     z(t) = L^{-1}[Z(s)] = L^{-1}[U(s) + iV(s)] = L^{-1}[U(s)] + iL^{-1}[V(s)] = u(t) + iv(t)\n     \\]\n\n4. **Separation of Real and Imaginary Parts**:\n   - To determine \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) separately, we need to extract the real and imaginary parts from \\( Z(s) \\).\n   - This separation is possible because \\( U(s) \\) and \\( V(s) \\) are the real and imaginary parts of \\( Z(s) \\), respectively.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Yes, we can determine \\( u(t) \\) and \\( v(t) \\) separately by using the inverse Laplace transform on \\( U(s) \\) and \\( V(s) \\) respectively.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
