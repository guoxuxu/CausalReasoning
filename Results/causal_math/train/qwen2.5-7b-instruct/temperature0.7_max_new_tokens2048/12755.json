However, the problem statement does not provide the final result or any specific information about the transformations.\n\n4. **Determine specific transformations:**\n   - Without additional information about the final result or the specific impact of the transformations, it is not possible to definitively determine the exact values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we cannot determine the specific transformations made based solely on the information provided.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's analyze the given integral \\( I = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} \\cos(tx) \\, dx \\) and see how the transformations \\( u = ax + b \\) affect it.\n\n1. **Transformation Analysis**:\n   - If we apply the transformation \\( u = ax + b \\), then \\( du = a \\, dx \\). The limits of integration change accordingly.\n   - The integral becomes \\( I = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-(\\frac{u-b}{a})^2} \\cos(t(\\frac{u-b}{a})) \\, du \\).\n\n2. **Simplifying the Integral**:\n   - Simplify the exponent and cosine term: \\( I = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-\\frac{(u-b)^2}{a^2}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{t(u-b)}{a}\\right) \\, du \\).\n   - This is a standard Gaussian integral with a phase shift and scaling factor.\n\n3. **Impact of Constants**:\n   - The constant \\( b \\) (shift) does not change the value of the integral because the Gaussian function is symmetric and the cosine term is periodic.\n   - The constant \\( a \\) scales the integral, but for the specific form of the integrand, the scaling factor \\( a \\) will cancel out due to the properties of the Gaussian integral and the cosine function.\n\n4. **Given Information**:\n   - We know the final result of the integral after applying transformations, but the exact transformations (values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)) do not change the form of the integral significantly in terms of determining the specific values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that the integral's form remains consistent under these transformations and the final result is known, we cannot uniquely determine the specific values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) without additional information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
