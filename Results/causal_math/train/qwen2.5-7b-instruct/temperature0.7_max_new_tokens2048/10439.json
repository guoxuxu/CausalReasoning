The Laplace transform from \\( t_1 \\) onwards is:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{B(t-t_1)}x\\}(s) = \\int_{t_1}^\\infty e^{-st}e^{B(t-t_1)}x \\, dt = x e^{-t_1 B} \\int_{t_1}^\\infty e^{-(s-B)t} \\, dt\n     \\]\n     Assuming \\( s \\neq B \\), the integral evaluates to:\n     \\[\n     x e^{-t_1 B} \\left[ \\frac{e^{-(s-B)t}}{-(s-B)} \\right]_{t_1}^\\infty = x e^{-t_1 B} \\left( \\frac{1}{s-B} \\right) = \\frac{x e^{-t_1 B}}{s-B}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combining the Parts**:\n   - The overall Laplace transform is the sum of the two parts:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}\\{z\\}(s) = x \\left( \\frac{e^{(A-s)t_1} - 1}{A-s} \\right) + \\frac{x e^{-t_1 B}}{s-B}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Dependency Analysis**:\n   - From the expression above, it is clear that the Laplace transform depends on both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\). Specifically, the term involving \\( A \\) appears in the first part, and the term involving \\( B \\) appears in the second part.\n   - Therefore, the Laplace transform at any \\( s \\) does depend on both \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
