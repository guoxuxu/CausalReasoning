Applying the Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) to \\( x_0 \\) gives us \\( \\hat{x}_0 = \\mathcal{F}[x_0] \\).\n\n2. **Evolution Under Linear Operator**: The system evolves according to the differential equation \\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\). This can be solved using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \\( L \\). For a linear system, the solution can be written as:\n   \\[\n   x(t) = e^{Lt} x_0\n   \\]\n   where \\( e^{Lt} \\) is the matrix exponential of \\( Lt \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of Evolved Function**: Applying the Fourier transform to the evolved function \\( x(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}(t) = \\mathcal{F}[x(t)] = \\mathcal{F}[e^{Lt} x_0]\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To get back to the time domain, we apply the inverse Fourier transform \\( \\mathcal{F}^{-1} \\):\n   \\[\n   x(t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{x}(t)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\mathcal{F}[e^{Lt} x_0]]\n   \\]\n\n5. **Property of Fourier Transform**: A key property of the Fourier transform is that it commutes with the action of the linear operator \\( L \\) when exponentiated. Specifically, for a linear operator \\( L \\), the Fourier transform of \\( e^{Lt} x_0 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\hat{x}_0(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   where \\( \\hat{x}_0(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}[x_0] \\).\n\n6. **Final Time Evolution**: At time \\( t = T \\):\n   \\[\n   \\hat{x}(T) = e^{i\\omega T} \\hat{x}_0(\\omega)\n   \\]\n   Applying the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[\n   x(T) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{x}(T)] = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[e^{i\\omega T} \\hat{x}_0(\\omega)]\n   \\]\n\n7. **Comparison**: Comparing the final evolved function obtained directly from the initial function \\( x_0 \\) to the one obtained through the Fourier transform and inverse transform:\n   \\[\n   x(T) = e^{LT} x_0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[e^{i\\omega T} \\hat{x}_0(\\omega)] = e^{LT} x_0\n   \\]\n\nGiven these steps, the function \\( \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[x(t)] \\) at \\( t = T \\) is indeed the same as the direct evolution of \\( x_0 \\) to \\( t = T \\) under \\( x'(t) = Lx(t) \\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
