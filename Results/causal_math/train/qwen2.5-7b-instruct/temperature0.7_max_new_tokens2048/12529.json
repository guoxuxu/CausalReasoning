So, if \\( g(x) \\) was applied, then the original \\( x \\) could be either \\( 2 \\) or \\( -6 \\) for the values \\( 3 \\) and \\( -5 \\) respectively.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Without additional information about the sequence of operations, we cannot definitively determine whether \\( g(x) \\) was applied to a previous value of \\( x \\). The observed \\( x = 3 \\) could result from applying \\( g(x) \\) to \\( 2 \\) or directly from the initial condition.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the given relations:**\n   - The function \\( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\).\n   - The transformation \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\).\n\n2. **Given condition:**\n   - \\( y = 16 \\) at \\( x = 3 \\).\n\n3. **Check if \\( g(x) \\) was applied to a previous value of \\( x \\):**\n   - If \\( g(x) \\) was applied to a previous value of \\( x \\), then the previous value would be \\( x - 1 \\).\n   - We need to check if \\( y = 16 \\) at \\( x = 2 \\) (since \\( g(2) = 3 \\)).\n\n4. **Calculate \\( y \\) for \\( x = 2 \\):**\n   - Substitute \\( x = 2 \\) into \\( y = x^2 + 2x + 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     y = 2^2 + 2 \\cdot 2 + 1 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9\n     \\]\n   - So, \\( y = 9 \\) when \\( x = 2 \\), not \\( y = 16 \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since \\( y = 16 \\) is observed at \\( x = 3 \\) and not at \\( x = 2 \\), it cannot be deduced that \\( g(x) \\) was applied to a previous value of \\( x \\) without further information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}."
