This means \\( u(x, t_1) \\) changes to \\( u'(x, t_1) = u(x, t_1) + h(x) \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of Modified Function**: The Fourier transform of the modified function \\( u'(x, t_1) \\) at time \\( t_1 \\) is:\n   \\[\n   F'(\\omega, t_1) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega x} u'(x, t_1) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega x} (u(x, t_1) + h(x)) dx\n   \\]\n   Since the Fourier transform is linear, we can split this into two integrals:\n   \\[\n   F'(\\omega, t_1) = F(\\omega, t_1) + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-i \\omega x} h(x) dx\n   \\]\n\n4. **Propagation Over Time**: The heat equation is a linear partial differential equation. Therefore, the solution \\( u(x, t) \\) for \\( t > t_1 \\) depends on the initial condition \\( u(x, t_1) \\) through the heat kernel (Green's function). Specifically, the solution at any later time \\( T > t_1 \\) is given by convolving the initial condition at \\( t_1 \\) with the heat kernel.\n\n5. **Effect on \\( F(\\omega, T) \\)**: Since the Fourier transform is a linear operation and the heat equation is linear, the Fourier transform of \\( u(x, t) \\) at any time \\( T > t_1 \\) will be affected by the change in the initial condition at \\( t_1 \\). Specifically, the Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega, T) \\) will include the contribution from the modified initial condition plus the contribution from the original initial condition.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega, T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\) will not depend solely on the new condition at \\( t_1 \\); it will also depend on the original condition at \\( t_1 \\) due to the nature of the heat equation and its solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
