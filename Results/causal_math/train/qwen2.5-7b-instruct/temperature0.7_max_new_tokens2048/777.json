    "To reason through this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The system is described by the differential equation \\(\\frac{dx}{dt} = P x\\), where \\(P\\) is a constant matrix. This is a linear time-invariant (LTI) system.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform Application**: Applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   L\\left[\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right] = L[P x]\n   \\]\n   Using the properties of the Laplace transform, specifically that \\(L\\left[\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right] = sX(s) - x(0)\\) and \\(L[P x] = P X(s)\\), where \\(X(s) = L{x}(s)\\), we obtain:\n   \\[\n   sX(s) - x(0) = P X(s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solving for \\(X(s)\\)**: Rearranging the above equation, we find:\n   \\[\n   (sI - P)X(s) = x(0)\n   \\]\n   where \\(I\\) is the identity matrix. Assuming \\(sI - P\\) is invertible, we can solve for \\(X(s)\\):\n   \\[\n   X(s) = (sI - P)^{-1} x(0)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: To find the time-domain response \\(x(t)\\) at any time \\(t\\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\(X(s)\\):\n   \\[\n   x(t) = L^{-1}\\left[(sI - P)^{-1} x(0)\\right]\n   \\]\n\n5. **Specific Time \\(T\\)**: At time \\(T\\), the response \\(x(T)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   x(T) = L^{-1}\\left[(sI - P)^{-1} x(0)\\right]\\Bigg|_{t=T}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verification**: By definition, if we directly compute \\(x(T)\\) from the differential equation without taking the Laplace transform, we would have:\n   \\[\n   x(t) = e^{Pt} x(0)\n   \\]\n   Evaluating at \\(t = T\\):\n   \\[\n   x(T) = e^{PT} x(0)\n   \\]\n\n7. **Comparison**: Now, let's compare this with the expression obtained using the inverse Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   x(T) = L^{-1}\\left[(sI - P)^{-1} x(0)\\right]\\Bigg|_{t=T}\n   \\]\n   From the properties of the Laplace transform and the matrix exponential, we know:\n   \\[\n   (sI - P)^{-1} = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{Pt} dt \\cdot I\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   (sI - P)^{-1} x(0) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{Pt} x(0) dt\n   \\]\n   Taking the inverse Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   L^{-1}\\left[(sI - P)^{-1} x(0)\\right] = e^{Pt} x(0)\n   \\]\n   Evaluating at \\(t = T\\):\n   \\[\n   x(T) = e^{PT} x(0)\n   \\]\n\nSince both methods yield the same result, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
