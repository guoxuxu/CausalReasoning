    "To analyze this problem, let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Transformation**: The linear operator \\( L \\) transforms \\( f(x) \\) into \\( f(ax + b) \\).

Let \\( u = ax + b \\), then \\( du = a dx \\) and the limits of integration will also change accordingly. However, since the original integral is from 0 to \\(\\infty\\), we need to ensure that the new limits still cover the same range.\n\n3. **Change of Variables**: When \\( x = 0 \\), \\( u = b \\); when \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\( u \\to \\infty \\) if \\( a > 0 \\).

    "To address this question, let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation \\( L \\) applied to \\( f(x) \\) results in \\( L[f(x)] = f(ax + b) \\).
