This means the peak of \\(Z(\\omega)\\) is exactly at \\(\\omega\\), regardless of the value of \\(\\omega\\).\n\nTherefore, if \\(\\omega\\) is increased, the peak of \\(Z(\\omega)\\) does not shift but remains fixed at the new value of \\(\\omega\\). The peak frequency of \\(Z(\\omega)\\) directly corresponds to the value of \\(\\omega\\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer to whether the peak of \\(Z(\\omega)\\) shifts to higher frequencies when \\(\\omega\\) is increased is \"No\".\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "To determine if increasing \\(\\omega\\) will cause the peak of \\(Z(\\omega)\\) to shift to higher frequencies, let's analyze the given functions step by step.\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   - The function \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) is a complex exponential.\n   - The Fourier transform of \\(z(t)\\) is defined as \\(Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\).\n\n2. **Substitute \\(z(t)\\) into the Fourier Transform**:\n   - Substitute \\(z(t) = e^{i\\omega t}\\) into the Fourier transform formula:\n     \\[\n     Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1 \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral does not converge because it is the integral of a constant over an infinite range.\n\n3. **Correct Interpretation for Fourier Transform**:\n   - The correct form should be:\n     \\[\n     Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\omega t} e^{-i\\omega t'} dt\n     \\]\n   - Here, \\(t'\\) is the variable of integration, and \\(\\omega\\) is the parameter of the Fourier transform. Correcting the notation:\n     \\[\n     Z(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - \\omega') t} dt\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving the Integral**:\n   - The integral \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i(\\omega - \\omega') t} dt\\) is the definition of the Dirac delta function \\(\\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\\):\n     \\[\n     Z(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega')\n     \\]\n\n5. **Interpreting the Result**:\n   - The Fourier transform \\(Z(\\omega)\\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\(\\omega' = \\omega\\).\n   - The peak of \\(Z(\\omega)\\) is at \\(\\omega = \\omega'\\).\n\n6. **Effect of Increasing \\(\\omega\\)**:\n   - If \\(\\omega\\) is increased, the peak of \\(Z(\\omega)\\) remains at \\(\\omega' = \\omega\\).\n   - Therefore, increasing \\(\\omega\\) does not shift the peak of \\(Z(\\omega)\\); it stays at the same frequency.\n\nGiven this analysis, the peak of \\(Z(\\omega)\\) does not shift to higher frequencies when \\(\\omega\\) is increased.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
