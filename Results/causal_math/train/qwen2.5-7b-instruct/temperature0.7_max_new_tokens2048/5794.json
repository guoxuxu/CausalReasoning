This is a first-order linear PDE and can be solved using the method of characteristics.\n\n2. **Method of Characteristics:**\n   For the PDE \\(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} + x \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = 0\\), the characteristic equations are:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{dt}{1} = \\frac{dx}{x} = \\frac{dz}{0}\n   \\]\n   Solving these, we get \\(z = f(x e^{-t})\\), where \\(f\\) is an arbitrary function.\n\n3. **Intervention Function \\(h(x, t)\\):**\n   We have \\(z(x, t) = u(x, t) + v(x, t)\\), where both \\(u(x, t)\\) and \\(v(x, t)\\) satisfy their own PDEs but together they form the solution to the given PDE.\n\n4. **Initial Condition at \\(t = T\\):**\n   Given \\(z(x, T)\\), we know that at time \\(T\\), \\(z(x, T) = u(x, T) + v(x, T)\\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Initial Conditions:**\n   To uniquely determine the initial conditions \\(u(x, 0)\\) and \\(v(x, 0)\\), we need to ensure that the solution to the PDE is unique. The method of characteristics shows that the solution is uniquely determined by the initial condition along the characteristics. \n\n6. **Backward Characteristics:**\n   If we know \\(z(x, T)\\), we can trace back the characteristics to find \\(u(x, 0)\\) and \\(v(x, 0)\\) because the characteristics will intersect the initial plane at \\(t = 0\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   Since the characteristics provide a unique way to map from \\(z(x, T)\\) back to the initial conditions, and since the functions \\(u(x, t)\\) and \\(v(x, t)\\) are solutions to well-defined PDEs, the initial conditions \\(u(x, 0)\\) and \\(v(x, 0)\\) can indeed be uniquely identified.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
