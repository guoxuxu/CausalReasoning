    "To determine whether we can accurately deduce the initial conditions \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\) from the Fourier Transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\omega)\\) at a specific frequency \\(\\omega\\) without knowing the matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), let's reason through this step-by-step.\n\n1. **System of Differential Equations**:\n   - We have two differential equations: \\(\\dot{x} = Ax\\) and \\(\\dot{y} = By\\).\n   - These describe how \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) evolve over time.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\(z(t)\\) is given by \\(\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\).\n   - For \\(z(t) = x(t) + iy(t)\\), we get \\(\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}(x)(\\omega) + i\\mathcal{F}(y)(\\omega)\\).\n\n3. **Initial Conditions and Fourier Transform**:\n   - The initial conditions for \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) are \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\) respectively.\n   - At \\(t=0\\), \\(z(0) = x_0 + iy_0\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\omega)\\) evaluated at \\(\\omega\\) will contain information about \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\) because the Fourier Transform at any frequency \\(\\omega\\) will be influenced by the initial values of \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\).\n\n4. **Influence of Matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)**:\n   - The matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) determine the dynamics of \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\) over time.\n   - However, the Fourier Transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\omega)\\) evaluated at a specific frequency \\(\\omega\\) does not directly depend on \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) but rather on the initial conditions \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\) through the exponential decay terms \\(e^{At}\\) and \\(e^{Bt}\\) in the time domain solutions.\n\n5. **Deducing Initial Conditions**:\n   - Since \\(\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\omega)\\) contains the Fourier Transforms of \\(x(t)\\) and \\(y(t)\\), which are integrals involving the initial conditions \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\), it is possible to extract these initial conditions if we know the form of the Fourier Transforms of the solutions to the differential equations.\n   - Specifically, the Fourier Transform of the solution to \\(\\dot{x} = Ax\\) (which is \\(x(t) = x_0 e^{At}\\)) and \\(\\dot{y} = By\\) (which is \\(y(t) = y_0 e^{Bt}\\)) can be written in terms of \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, we can conclude that the Fourier Transform \\(\\mathcal{F}(z)(\\omega)\\) at a specific frequency \\(\\omega\\) indeed contains information about the initial conditions \\(x_0\\) and \\(y_0\\). Therefore, we can accurately deduce the initial conditions from the Fourier Transform without needing to know the matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
