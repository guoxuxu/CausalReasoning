This operation modifies the state \\( z \\) but does not directly affect the dynamics of the system as described by \\( \\dot{z} \\).\n\n3. **Effect of Control**: When the control operation \\( g(z) = Dz \\) is applied at time \\( t_1 < T \\), it modifies the state \\( z \\) at that instant. However, the effect of this control is local in time, meaning it affects the state immediately but does not have a long-term effect unless the modified state continues to evolve under the same dynamics.\n\n4. **Noise Interaction**: The noise term \\( \\eta(t) \\) is stochastic and interacts with the state \\( z \\).
