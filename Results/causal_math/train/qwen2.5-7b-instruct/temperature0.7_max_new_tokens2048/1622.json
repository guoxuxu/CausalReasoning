    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: \n   - We have a function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n   - This function undergoes a transformation defined by \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) \\, dt \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Transformation**:\n   - Substitute \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) into the integral transformation:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} e^{i\\omega t} \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s - i\\omega)t} \\, dt\n     \\]\n   - This is a standard form of an exponential integral. We can solve it as follows:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-(s - i\\omega)t}}{-(s - i\\omega)} \\right]_0^\\infty\n     \\]\n   - Evaluating the limits:\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Reconstructing \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - The output of the transformation is \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\).\n   - To determine if we can accurately reconstruct \\( z(t) \\) from \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) \\), we need to consider the inverse transformation.\n   - The inverse Laplace transform (which is what we're effectively using here) should ideally allow us to recover the original function from its transformed version.\n\n4. **Inverse Transformation**:\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\) is indeed \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\\right\\} = e^{i\\omega t}\n     \\]\n   - This means that given \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\), we can uniquely determine \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the transformation is one-to-one and we can accurately invert it to get back the original function, we can conclude that the function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) can be accurately reconstructed from \\( \\mathcal{F}(z)(s) \\) without any additional information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}."
