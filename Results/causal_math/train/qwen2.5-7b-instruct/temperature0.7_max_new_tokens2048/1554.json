    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a complex function \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\).\n   - The real part \\( x(t) \\) follows \\( \\dot{x} = A x(t) \\).\n   - The imaginary part \\( y(t) \\) follows \\( \\dot{y} = B y(t) \\).\n   - We apply the Laplace transform to both \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) to get \\( X(s) \\) and \\( Y(s) \\), respectively.\n   - The combined Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) is given as \\( Z(s) = X(s) + i Y(s) \\).\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of Differential Equations:**\n   - For \\( \\dot{x} = A x(t) \\), the Laplace transform gives \\( sX(s) - x(0) = A X(s) \\). Therefore, \\( X(s) = \\frac{x(0)}{s - A} \\).\n   - For \\( \\dot{y} = B y(t) \\), the Laplace transform gives \\( sY(s) - y(0) = B Y(s) \\). Therefore, \\( Y(s) = \\frac{y(0)}{s - B} \\).\n\n3. **Expressing \\( Z(s) \\):**\n   - Using the above results, we have \\( Z(s) = \\frac{x(0)}{s - A} + i \\frac{y(0)}{s - B} \\).\n\n4. **Uniqueness of Determining Initial Conditions:**\n   - To uniquely determine \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\), we need to be able to extract them from \\( Z(s) \\) without any ambiguity.\n   - From \\( Z(s) \\), we can separate the real and imaginary parts:\n     - Real part: \\( \\text{Re}(Z(s)) = \\frac{x(0)}{s - A} \\)\n     - Imaginary part: \\( \\text{Im}(Z(s)) = \\frac{y(0)}{s - B} \\)\n\n5. **Checking for Uniqueness:**\n   - If \\( Z(s) \\) is known for all \\( s \\neq A \\) and \\( s \\neq B \\), we can solve for \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\):\n     - \\( x(0) = (s - A) \\text{Re}(Z(s)) \\) when evaluated at \\( s = A \\)\n     - \\( y(0) = (s - B) \\text{Im}(Z(s)) \\) when evaluated at \\( s = B \\)\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - With the knowledge of \\( Z(s) \\) at points \\( s = A \\) and \\( s = B \\), we can uniquely determine \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"Yes\"}\n```"
