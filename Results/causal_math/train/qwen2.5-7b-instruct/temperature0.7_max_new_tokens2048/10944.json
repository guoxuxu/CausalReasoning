There could be multiple pairs of \\( f(z) \\) and \\( h(w) \\) that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Function and Transformation:**\n   - We start with \\( f(z) = e^z \\).\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( f(z) \\) is given as \\( g(w) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{zw} e^{-z^2 / 2} dz \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Filtering in the Frequency Domain:**\n   - Suppose there is an unknown filter \\( h(w) \\) applied in the frequency domain.\n   - The modified function in the frequency domain becomes \\( g'(w) = g(w) \\cdot h(w) \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Fourier Transform:**\n   - Applying the inverse Fourier transform to \\( g'(w) \\) should ideally give us the original function \\( f(z) \\) if no filtering were applied.\n   - However, due to the presence of the filter \\( h(w) \\), the inverse Fourier transform will not yield \\( f(z) \\) exactly but rather a modified version \\( f'(z) \\).\n\n4. **Recovering Original Function and Filter:**\n   - To determine both \\( f(z) \\) and \\( h(w) \\) precisely from \\( g'(w) \\):\n     - We need to know \\( g'(w) \\) explicitly.\n     - Without additional information about \\( g'(w) \\), it is impossible to uniquely determine \\( f(z) \\) and \\( h(w) \\) because the multiplication in the frequency domain could result from many different pairs of \\( f(z) \\) and \\( h(w) \\).\n\nGiven these considerations, we cannot precisely determine the original unaltered function \\( f(z) \\) and the filter \\( h(w) \\) used solely based on the transformed function \\( g'(w) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",

However, without additional information about \\( h(w) \\), there could be multiple filters that result in the same \\( g'(w) \\).\n\n- **Filter Identification:**\n  - Given \\( f'(z) \\), we know \\( f'(z) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[g'(w)] \\).\n  - To find \\( h(w) \\), we need to solve \\( g'(w) = h(w) \\cdot g(w) \\). This is generally not straightforward without more constraints because the multiplication in the frequency domain corresponds to convolution in the time domain, and convolution is not uniquely invertible without additional information.\n\n- **Original Function Determination:**\n  - Even if we know \\( g'(w) \\) and \\( h(w) \\), determining the exact form of \\( f(z) \\) from \\( g(w) \\) alone is challenging due to the non-uniqueness of the inverse Fourier transform.\n\nGiven these considerations, it is not possible to precisely determine both the original function \\( f(z) \\) and the filter \\( h(w) \\) solely from the modified function \\( f'(z) \\) without additional information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
