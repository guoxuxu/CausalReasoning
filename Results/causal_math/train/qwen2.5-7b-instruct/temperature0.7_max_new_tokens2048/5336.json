    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE**: The given PDE is the wave equation in one dimension:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\nabla^2 u\n   \\]\n   This describes how the function \\(u(x,t)\\) evolves over time, with \\(c\\) being the speed of sound.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   F\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2}\\right) = -\\omega^2 F(u)\n   \\]\n   and\n   \\[\n   F(c^2 \\nabla^2 u) = (c^2 k^2) F(u)\n   \\]\n   Thus, the transformed equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   -\\omega^2 F(u) = c^2 k^2 F(u)\n   \\]\n   Or simplifying:\n   \\[\n   F(u) = A e^{i (kx - \\omega t)}\n   \\]\n   Where \\(A\\) is the amplitude, and the exponential term represents the wave propagation.\n\n3. **Filtering Process**: Suppose a filtering process \\(H(\\omega)\\) is applied to \\(F(u)\\):\n   \\[\n   F(u) \\rightarrow H(\\omega) F(u) = H(\\omega) A e^{i (kx - \\omega t)}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Natural System Evolution**: After filtering, the solution evolves naturally according to the wave equation. The key point here is that the filtering and evolution process does not change the form of the solution significantly; it just modifies the amplitude.\n\n5. **Determining \\(u(t)\\) at \\(t=0\\)**: To determine \\(u(t)\\) at \\(t=0\\), we need to analyze the inverse Fourier transform of the filtered and evolved function. Given the filtering and evolution process, the function at any time \\(T\\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   u(x,T) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[H(\\omega) A e^{i (kx - \\omega T)}]\n   \\]\n   By knowing \\(u(x,T)\\), we can trace back to find \\(u(x,0)\\) because the filtering and evolution do not fundamentally alter the initial condition but modify its frequency components.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Yes, we can determine the original function \\(u(t)\\) at \\(t=0\\) by analyzing the solution at \\(t=T\\).

    "Let's reason through this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE**: The given PDE is the wave equation, which describes how waves propagate through a medium. Here, \\(u\\) represents the displacement, \\(t\\) is time, and \\(\\nabla^2\\) is the Laplacian operator representing spatial derivatives.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform to the wave equation can simplify the analysis because the Laplacian in the spatial domain becomes multiplication by \\(-\\omega^2\\) in the frequency domain. This transforms the PDE into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in \\(\\omega\\).\n\n3. **Effect of Filtering Process**: A filtering process \\(H(\\omega)\\) modifies the Fourier transform of the solution.
