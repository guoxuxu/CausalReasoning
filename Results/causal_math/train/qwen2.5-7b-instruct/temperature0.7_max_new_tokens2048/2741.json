    "Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Differential Equation**: The function \\( z(t) \\) is governed by the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{z} = i\\omega z + \\lambda z\n   \\]\n   This can be rewritten as:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{z} = (i\\omega + \\lambda)z\n   \\]\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The integral transformation is defined as:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-\\lambda s} z(s) ds\n   \\]\n   At \\( t = 0 \\), \\( T(z) = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Evolution of \\( z(t) \\)**: The function \\( z(t) \\) evolves according to the differential equation without further intervention. The form of \\( z(t) \\) can be solved by considering the characteristic equation associated with the differential equation:\n   \\[\n   \\dot{z} = (i\\omega + \\lambda)z\n   \\]\n   The solution to this differential equation is:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z_0 e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)t}\n   \\]\n   where \\( z_0 \\) is the initial condition at \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Applying the Integral Transformation**: When we apply the integral transformation \\( T(z) \\) to \\( z(t) \\):\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-\\lambda s} z(s) ds = \\int_0^t e^{-\\lambda s} z_0 e^{(i\\omega + \\lambda)s} ds\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the integrand:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = z_0 \\int_0^t e^{(i\\omega)s} ds = z_0 \\left[ \\frac{e^{(i\\omega)s}}{i\\omega} \\right]_0^t = z_0 \\left( \\frac{e^{i\\omega t} - 1}{i\\omega} \\right)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Effect of Angular Frequency \\( \\omega \\)**: The term \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) in the expression for \\( T(z) \\) shows that the evolution of \\( T(z) \\) over time is directly influenced by the angular frequency \\( \\omega \\). The presence of \\( \\omega \\) in the exponent means that changes in \\( \\omega \\) will affect the value of \\( T(z) \\) at any given time \\( t \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since \\( T(z) \\) depends on \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), it is clear that the value of \\( T(z) \\) at any time \\( t \\) (including \\( T \\)) is influenced by the angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
