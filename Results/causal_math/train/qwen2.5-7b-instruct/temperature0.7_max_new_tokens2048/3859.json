This introduces a change in the evolution of \\( z(t) \\) starting from \\( t_1 \\).\n\n3. **Differential Equation**: The function \\( z(t) \\) also satisfies the differential equation \\( \\dot{z} = Mz \\). This implies that without any intervention, \\( z(t) \\) would evolve according to \\( z(t) = z(t_1)e^{Mt - t_1} \\) for \\( t \\geq t_1 \\).\n\n4. **Combining Transformations**: After the intervention at \\( t_1 \\), the effect of both transformations needs to be considered. The combined effect can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(t_1) e^{Qt - t_1} e^{M(t - t_1)} \\quad \\text{for } t \\geq t_1.\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = z(t_1) e^{(Q + M)(t - t_1)} \\quad \\text{for } t \\geq t_1.\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Endpoint Calculation**: To find \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = z(t_1) e^{(Q + M)(T - t_1)}.\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( z(t_1) \\) itself is determined by the initial condition and the transformation up to \\( t_1 \\). However, the expression for \\( z(T) \\) explicitly includes both \\( M \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**: From the above expression, it is clear that \\( z(T) \\) depends on both \\( M \\) and \\( Q \\). Therefore, \\( z(T) \\) does not depend solely on \\( M \\).\n\nBased on the analysis, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
