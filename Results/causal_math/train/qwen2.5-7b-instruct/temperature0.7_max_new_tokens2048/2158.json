    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The original function is \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\). This is a pure sinusoidal wave in the time domain with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform of Original Function**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\( \\omega \\), i.e., \\( Z(f) = 2\\pi \\delta(f - \\omega) \\). This indicates that all the energy of the signal is concentrated at the frequency \\( \\omega \\).\n\n3. **Modified Function**: When we multiply \\( z(t) \\) by \\( e^{-\\alpha t} u(t) \\), where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function (to ensure the function is zero for \\( t < 0 \\)), we get the modified function \\( z_m(t) = e^{i\\omega t} e^{-\\alpha t} u(t) = e^{-(\\alpha - i\\omega)t} u(t) \\).\n\n4. **Fourier Transform of Modified Function**: The Fourier transform of \\( z_m(t) \\) will spread the energy over a range of frequencies around \\( \\omega \\). Specifically, it will result in a Lorentzian-like spectrum centered at \\( \\omega \\) with a width inversely proportional to \\( \\alpha \\). This is due to the fact that the Fourier transform of a decaying exponential multiplied by a unit step function results in a sinc-like function in the frequency domain.\n\n5. **Recovery Analysis**: To recover the original function \\( z(t) \\) from its modified Fourier transform, we would need to invert the Fourier transform. However, because the modified Fourier transform is no longer a single impulse but a broadened spectrum, it contains information about other frequencies as well. This means that the inverse Fourier transform will not yield just \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), but rather a combination of frequencies around \\( \\omega \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the modified Fourier transform contains additional frequency components due to the exponential decay, the original function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) cannot be uniquely recovered from its modified Fourier transform.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original Function**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a complex exponential with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\).
