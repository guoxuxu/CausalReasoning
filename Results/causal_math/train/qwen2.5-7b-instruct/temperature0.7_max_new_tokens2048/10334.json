This is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation. Its general solution can be written as:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   where \\(A\\) is a constant determined by initial conditions.\n\n2. **Integral Transformation**: The integral transformation is defined as:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} z(s) \\, ds\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\(z(s) = A e^{i\\omega s}\\) into the integral, we get:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = \\int_0^t e^{-i\\omega s} A e^{i\\omega s} \\, ds = \\int_0^t A \\, ds = At\n   \\]\n   Since \\(A\\) is a constant, \\(T(z) = At\\).\n\n3. **Observing \\(T(z)\\) at \\(t = T\\)**: If we observe \\(T(z)\\) at \\(t = T\\), then:\n   \\[\n   T(z) = AT\n   \\]\n\n4. **Deducing \\(z(t)\\) from \\(T(z)\\)**: From the above, we see that \\(T(z) = AT\\). Knowing \\(T(z)\\) at any time \\(t = T\\), we can determine \\(A\\):\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{T(z)}{T}\n   \\]\n   With \\(A\\) known, we can reconstruct \\(z(t)\\) using the general solution:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = A e^{i\\omega t} = \\left(\\frac{T(z)}{T}\\right) e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given \\(T(z)\\) at \\(t = T\\), we can indeed deduce the original function \\(z(t)\\) over the interval [0, T].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
