For simplicity, let's assume the integral is taken over a finite interval from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). Thus:\n     \\[\n     L(z) = \\int_a^b 1 dt = b - a.\n     \\]\n   - This shows that the transformation \\(L\\) simplifies the function to a constant value depending on the bounds.\n\n3. **Intervention \\(M(z)\\):**\n   - The operator \\(M\\) is defined as \\(M(z) = \\int z(t) d(t) dt\\).\n   - Here, \\(d(t)\\) is some differential operator or kernel.
