This means that \\(T\\) scales each component of \\(x\\) by a positive factor.\n\n3. **Intervention via Scaling Matrix \\(V\\)**: At some point \\(t_1\\), an additional scaling matrix \\(V\\) is applied. Since both \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are diagonal matrices with positive entries, they represent scaling operations on the components of the vector \\(x\\).\n\n4. **Effect of Interventions**: When \\(V\\) is applied after \\(T\\), the effect on \\(x\\) would be \\(V(Ux)\\). Since both \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are diagonal matrices, their multiplication results in another diagonal matrix. Thus, the combined effect of \\(T\\) and the intervention by \\(V\\) can be represented as a single scaling operation.\n\n5. **Final State Representation**: The final state \\(x(T)\\) after applying \\(T\\) followed by the intervention via \\(V\\) is still a scaled version of the original \\(x\\). The scaling factors from \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) combine to form a new set of scaling factors for the components of \\(x\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The final state \\(x(T)\\) is a result of the combined effects of both \\(T\\) and the intervention via \\(V\\).
