    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The Laplace transform of a function \\( f(t) \\) is defined as:\n   \\[\n   F(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}(s) = \\int_0^{\\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \\, dt\n   \\]\n\n2. **Effect of Applying \\( G(t) = t^k \\)**: If we apply \\( G(t) = t^k \\) to \\( f(t) \\), the new function becomes \\( g(t) = t^k f(t) \\).\n\n3. **Laplace Transform of the New Function**: The Laplace transform of \\( g(t) = t^k f(t) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   G(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{t^k f(t)\\}(s)\n   \\]\n   Using the property of the Laplace transform for multiplication by \\( t^k \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{t^k f(t)\\}(s) = (-1)^k \\frac{d^k}{ds^k} F(s)\n   \\]\n   This shows that the Laplace transform of \\( t^k f(t) \\) involves taking the \\( k \\)-th derivative of \\( F(s) \\).\n\n4. **Dependency on Original Function**: From the above expression, it is clear that the Laplace transform \\( G(s) \\) of the modified function \\( g(t) \\) depends not only on the original function \\( f(t) \\) but also on the operation \\( t^k \\) through the derivatives of \\( F(s) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the resultant \\( F(s) \\) (or rather, \\( G(s) \\)) does not depend solely on the original function \\( f(t) \\) without considering the effect of \\( t^k \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
