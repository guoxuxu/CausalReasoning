    "To determine if the original input signal \\( u(t) \\) can be accurately deduced from the observed output \\( y(t) \\) without knowing the presence or characteristics of the disturbance \\( d(t) \\), we need to analyze the system's behavior under the influence of both the input signal and the disturbance.\n\n1. **System Transfer Function**: The system is characterized by the transfer function \\( H(s) = \\frac{1}{s+1} \\).\n\n2. **Input-Output Relationship**: Without the disturbance, the relationship between the input \\( u(t) \\) and the output \\( y(t) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   Y(s) = H(s)U(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( Y(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of the output \\( y(t) \\) and \\( U(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of the input \\( u(t) \\).\n\n3. **Influence of Disturbance**: With the disturbance \\( d(t) \\) present, the total input to the system becomes \\( u(t) + d(t) \\).
