    "Let's analyze this step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Fourier Transform of \\( g(t) \\):**\n   - We know that the Fourier Transform of \\( g(t) = e^{-at^2} \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     G(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-at^2} e^{-i2\\pi ft} dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral represents the Gaussian function in the frequency domain. The exact form of \\( G(f) \\) for a Gaussian function \\( e^{-at^2} \\) is well-known and involves a scaling factor related to \\( a \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Modulation by \\( m(t) \\):**\n   - When we modulate \\( g(t) \\) with \\( m(t) = e^{ct} \\), the new function becomes \\( h(t) = g(t)m(t) = e^{-at^2}e^{ct} = e^{-(a-ic)t^2 + ct} \\).\n   - The Fourier Transform of \\( h(t) \\) would then be:\n     \\[\n     H(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-(a-ic)t^2 + ct} e^{-i2\\pi ft} dt\n     \\]\n   - This can be simplified to:\n     \\[\n     H(f) = e^{c^2/(4(a-ic))} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-(a-ic)(t - \\frac{c}{2(a-ic)})^2} e^{-i2\\pi f t} dt\n     \\]\n   - The integral part is again a Gaussian function, but with a shifted mean and a modified variance.\n\n3. **Reversing the Modulation:**\n   - Given \\( G(f) \\) after modulation, we need to determine if we can uniquely identify \\( g(t) \\) and the constant \\( c \\).\n   - The key here is the form of the Gaussian in the frequency domain. If we have \\( G(f) \\), we can attempt to deconvolve it to find the original \\( g(t) \\) and the modulation \\( e^{ct} \\).\n\n4. **Analysis of Uniqueness:**\n   - The Fourier Transform of a Gaussian remains a Gaussian, and the form of the Gaussian (variance and phase shift) can help us identify the parameters.\n   - However, the phase shift introduced by \\( e^{ct} \\) complicates the direct identification of \\( c \\) without additional information about the original function \\( g(t) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - While the form of \\( G(f) \\) can give us clues about the original function \\( g(t) \\) and the modulation, the phase shift due to \\( e^{ct} \\) introduces ambiguity unless we have more context or constraints.\n\nTherefore, based on the above analysis, we cannot uniquely deduce both the original function \\( g(t) \\) and the constant \\( c \\) solely from \\( G(f) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
