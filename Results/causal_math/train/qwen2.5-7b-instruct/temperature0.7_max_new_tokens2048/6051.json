This equation is typically used for electrostatics, fluid flow, and heat conduction in steady state.\n\n2. **Boundary Conditions**: For a system described by Laplace's equation, the boundary conditions play a crucial role in determining the solution. These conditions specify the values of \\(\\phi\\) on the boundaries of the region.\n\n3. **Intervention at Time \\(t_1\\)**: The problem states that at time \\(t_1\\), the boundary condition is changed to a new function \\(h(t_1, x)\\).
