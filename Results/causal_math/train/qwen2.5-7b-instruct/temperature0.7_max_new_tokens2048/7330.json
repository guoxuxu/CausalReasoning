    "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Functions**:\n   - \\( f(z) = z^2 \\): This is a simple quadratic function.\n   - \\( g(z) = e^{2\\pi iz} \\): This is a complex exponential function.\n\n2. **Transformation at \\( t = 1 \\)**:\n   - For \\( f(z) \\), if we apply it to \\( z_0 \\), then \\( f(z_0) = z_0^2 \\).\n   - For \\( g(z) \\), if we apply it to \\( z_0 \\), then \\( g(z_0) = e^{2\\pi iz_0} \\).\n\n3. **Evaluating at \\( t = 1 \\)**:\n   - If we are evaluating at \\( t = 1 \\), we need to determine what \\( t \\) represents. Given the context, it seems \\( t \\) might be a parameter in some integration or transformation process, but since \\( t = 1 \\) is not explicitly mentioned as a part of the functions themselves, we'll consider it as a general evaluation point for simplicity.\n\n4. **Observing the Results**:\n   - Without specific values for \\( z_0 \\), we cannot directly compare the results of \\( f(z_0) \\) and \\( g(z_0) \\). The results would depend on the value of \\( z_0 \\).\n   - For example, if \\( z_0 = 1 \\):\n     - \\( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \\)\n     - \\( g(1) = e^{2\\pi i \\cdot 1} = e^{2\\pi i} = 1 \\)\n   - However, if \\( z_0 = i \\):\n     - \\( f(i) = i^2 = -1 \\)\n     - \\( g(i) = e^{2\\pi i \\cdot i} = e^{-2\\pi} \\approx 0.001867 \\)\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - From the above examples, it's clear that the same value of \\( z_0 \\) can give different results when applying \\( f(z) \\) versus \\( g(z) \\).\n   - Therefore, without knowing the specific value of \\( z_0 \\) and without additional context about the nature of the integration or transformation, it is impossible to infer which function (either \\( f(z) \\) or \\( g(z) \\)) was applied to \\( z_0 \\) based solely on the observation at \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nBased on the reasoning above, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
