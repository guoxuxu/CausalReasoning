To determine if we can uniquely find \\( w \\) from \\( Z(s) \\), let's consider the inverse Laplace transform:\n   - The inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s - iw} \\) is indeed \\( e^{iwt} \\).\n   - This means that for any value of \\( w \\), the inverse Laplace transform will give us back \\( e^{iwt} \\).\n\n4. However, the key point here is that the Laplace transform does not provide information about the phase angle of the complex exponentials directly. It only gives the magnitude and frequency relationship.\n\n5. Importantly, the Laplace transform does not distinguish between different values of \\( w \\) because the form of the transformed function \\( \\frac{1}{s - iw} \\) is identical for different values of \\( w \\). The inverse Laplace transform would always yield an exponential with some frequency, but it wouldn't tell us which specific frequency \\( w \\) was used originally.\n\n6. Additionally, there could be multiple values of \\( w \\) that would result in the same form of \\( Z(s) \\) due to periodicity in the complex exponential (i.e., \\( e^{iwt} \\) is periodic with period \\( 2\\pi \\)).\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, we cannot uniquely determine the frequency \\( w \\) of the original function \\( z(t) \\) from the transformed function \\( Z(s) \\) without any ambiguity.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}",
