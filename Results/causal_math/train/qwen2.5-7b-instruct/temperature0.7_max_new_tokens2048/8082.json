    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**: The transformation given is \\( f(z) = e^{Ct}z \\).

Since \\( e^{Ct} \\) is a matrix exponential, its inverse is \\( e^{-Ct} \\). Thus, \\( z_0 = e^{-CT}z(T) \\).\n\n5. **Determining \\( z_0 \\)**: With \\( z(T) \\) known and the matrix \\( C \\) known (or assumed to be known), we can compute \\( z_0 \\) using the above formula.
