A term that decreases exponentially with \\( y(t) \\) (proportional to \\( -ky(t) \\)).\n     2. An integral term that integrates over the past history of \\( y(t) \\) from 0 to \\( t \\) (weighted by \\( e^{\\lambda (t-s)} \\)).\n\n2. **Intervention and Endpoint Information**:\n   - We have information about \\( y(t) \\) at a specific endpoint \\( T \\) after an intervention.\n   - An intervention could imply a change in one or both parameters \\( k \\) and \\( \\lambda \\).\n\n3. **Implications of Parameter Changes**:\n   - If \\( k \\) changes, it directly affects the rate of decay of \\( y(t) \\).\n   - If \\( \\lambda \\) changes, it affects how much weight is given to past values of \\( y(t) \\) in the integral term.\n\n4. **Distinguishing Between Parameter Changes**:\n   - **Change in \\( k \\)**: A change in \\( k \\) would be reflected in the rate of decay of \\( y(t) \\).

A larger \\( k \\) would cause \\( y(t) \\) to decay faster.\n   - **Parameter \\( \\lambda \\)**: The term \\( e^{\\lambda (t-s)} \\) in the integral suggests that the influence of past states decays exponentially with time. Changing \\( \\lambda \\) alters the rate at which this influence diminishes.
