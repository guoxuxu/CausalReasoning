    "To determine if we can reliably infer whether a polynomial term was added to \\( g(s) \\) based solely on the output \\( f(t) \\) at an arbitrary time \\( T \\), let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Fourier Transform Definition**: The given Fourier transform is \\( f(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(s) e^{ist} ds \\).\n\n2. **Effect of Adding a Polynomial Term**: If a polynomial term is added to \\( g(s) \\), it means that \\( g(s) \\) changes to \\( g(s) + p(s) \\), where \\( p(s) \\) is a polynomial. The new Fourier transform would be:\n   \\[\n   f'(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (g(s) + p(s)) e^{ist} ds = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(s) e^{ist} ds + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(s) e^{ist} ds = f(t) + \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(s) e^{ist} ds\n   \\]\n   This shows that adding a polynomial term \\( p(s) \\) to \\( g(s) \\) will add an additional term to \\( f(t) \\).\n\n3. **Reliability of Inference**: To infer whether a polynomial term was added to \\( g(s) \\), we need to know if the additional term \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(s) e^{ist} ds \\) can be uniquely identified from the change in \\( f(t) \\). \n\n4. **Complexity of Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of a polynomial term \\( p(s) \\) is not straightforward and depends on the specific form of \\( p(s) \\). For instance, a simple linear term like \\( s \\) would result in a constant term in the frequency domain, but higher-order terms would introduce more complex behavior. However, without knowing the exact form of \\( p(s) \\) and its coefficients, it is generally not possible to uniquely identify which polynomial term was added just by looking at the change in \\( f(t) \\).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given that the Fourier transform of a polynomial term does not provide enough information to uniquely determine the polynomial added, and because there could be multiple polynomials that produce similar effects on \\( f(t) \\), we cannot reliably infer the addition of a polynomial term to \\( g(s) \\) from \\( f(t) \\) alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
