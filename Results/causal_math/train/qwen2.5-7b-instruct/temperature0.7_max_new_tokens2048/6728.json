    "Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step.\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with the function \\( f(z) = z^n \\), where \\( n \\) is a positive integer and \\( z \\) is a complex number.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( f(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-i\\omega t} dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n\n3. **Effect of Scaling**: If a scaling factor \\( a \\) is applied to the function \\( f(t) \\), the new function becomes \\( f(at) \\). The Fourier transform of the scaled function \\( f(at) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   F_a(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(at) e^{-i\\omega t} dt\n   \\]\n   By substituting \\( u = at \\), we get \\( du = a dt \\) and the limits of integration remain the same (assuming the integral converges):\n   \\[\n   F_a(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{a} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(u) e^{-i\\omega \\frac{u}{a}} du = \\frac{1}{a} F\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{a}\\right)\n   \\]\n   This shows that scaling \\( f(t) \\) by \\( a \\) results in a scaling of the frequency domain representation \\( F(\\omega) \\) by \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\).\n\n4. **Modification of \\( n \\)**: Changing the power \\( n \\) directly modifies the function \\( f(t) \\) to \\( t^n \\). The Fourier transform of \\( t^n \\) is known for different values of \\( n \\), but the general form involves derivatives and powers of \\( \\omega \\).\n\n5. **Distinguishing Between Scaling and Power Modification**: To determine if the change in \\( F(\\omega) \\) is due to a scaling factor \\( a \\) or a change in \\( n \\), we need to compare the forms of \\( F(\\omega) \\) for different \\( n \\) and for \\( F(\\omega) \\) after scaling.\n\n   - For \\( f(t) = t^n \\), the Fourier transform \\( F(\\omega) \\) will have a specific form involving powers and derivatives of \\( \\omega \\).\n   - For \\( f(t) = a t^n \\), the Fourier transform \\( F_a(\\omega) \\) will be \\( \\frac{1}{a} F\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{a}\\right) \\).\n\nGiven these transformations, we can see that the effect of scaling \\( f(t) \\) by \\( a \\) is distinct from changing the power \\( n \\). Specifically, scaling changes the frequency domain representation by compressing or expanding it, while changing the power \\( n \\) changes the shape and form of the spectrum without such a simple scaling.\n\nTherefore, based on the properties of Fourier transforms and the distinct effects of scaling and modifying the power \\( n \\), we can determine if a scaling by \\( a \\) was applied or if the change was entirely due to modification of \\( n \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
