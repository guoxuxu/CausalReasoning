    "To determine if we can accurately backtrack and confirm whether \\(t\\) was initially set to 1 based on the output of \\(T[X]\\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Transform**: The integral transform \\(T[X] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-tx} f_X(x) dx\\) with \\(f_X(x) = e^{-x}\\) for \\(x > 0\\) simplifies to \\(T[X] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-tx} e^{-x} dx = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(t+1)x} dx\\).\n\n2. **Evaluate the Integral**: This integral evaluates to \\(\\frac{1}{t+1}\\) for \\(t > -1\\).\n\n3. **Consider the Output**: If we have an output from \\(T[X]\\), say \\(y\\), then \\(y = \\frac{1}{t+1}\\).
