    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The linear operator \\( L: V \\rightarrow W \\) maps vectors from vector space \\( V \\) to vector space \\( W \\).\n\n2.

For example, if \\( L \\) is a simple identity map (i.e., \\( L(v) = v \\)), then \\( w = v \\) and \\( w = Mv \\) would look identical unless we know \\( M \\).\n\n8.
