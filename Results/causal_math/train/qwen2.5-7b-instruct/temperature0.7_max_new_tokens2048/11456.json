However, knowing the result alone does not provide enough information to determine the exact sequence of operations used.\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - If the operation was just \\( e^{Az} \\), then the integral would be \\( \\int e^{Az} \\, dz = \\frac{e^{Az}}{A} + C \\).\n   - If the operation was \\( e^{Bz}w(z) \\), then the integral would involve integrating \\( e^{(A+B)z} \\), which would yield \\( \\frac{e^{(A+B)z}}{A+B} + C \\).\n\n6. **Uniqueness of Determination**: To uniquely determine the operations, we would need more information about the specific form of the result and the path of integration. Simply knowing the end result \\( I(w) \\) does not give us enough information to distinguish between the two cases unless additional constraints or details are provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot uniquely determine the sequential operations used during the integration by knowing only the end result of \\( I(w) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can uniquely identify the operations performed on \\( w(z) \\) given only the result of the integral \\( I(w) \\), let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Function**: We start with \\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\), where \\( A \\) is a complex constant.\n2. **Transformation**: The integral transformation is defined as \\( I(w) = \\int w(z) dz \\).\n3. **Possible Operations**:\n   - Directly using \\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\).\n   - Using \\( e^{Bz}w(z) = e^{Bz}e^{Az} = e^{(A+B)z} \\).\n\n4. **Integral Calculation**:\n   - For \\( w(z) = e^{Az} \\), the integral is \\( I(w) = \\int e^{Az} dz = \\frac{1}{A}e^{Az} + C \\), where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n   - For \\( e^{Bz}w(z) = e^{(A+B)z} \\), the integral is \\( I(w) = \\int e^{(A+B)z} dz = \\frac{1}{A+B}e^{(A+B)z} + C \\).\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Identification**:\n   - If we know only the end result of \\( I(w) \\), say \\( I(w) = F(z) \\), then we need to determine whether \\( F(z) \\) corresponds to \\( \\frac{1}{A}e^{Az} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{A+B}e^{(A+B)z} \\).\n   - Without additional information about the form of \\( F(z) \\), it is not possible to uniquely determine whether \\( A \\) or \\( A+B \\) is the correct exponent. Both forms can yield similar results depending on the value of \\( B \\).\n\nGiven the above analysis, we cannot uniquely determine the sequential operations used based solely on the end result of \\( I(w) \\).
