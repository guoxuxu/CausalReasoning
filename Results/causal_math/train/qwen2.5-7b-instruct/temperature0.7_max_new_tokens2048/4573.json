    "Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the PDE**: The given PDE is a linear first-order partial differential equation known as the advection equation. It describes how a quantity \\( u(x,t) \\) changes over time due to a constant velocity \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Applying the Fourier transform \\( F(u) \\) to \\( u(x,0) \\) means we're transforming the initial condition from the spatial domain to the frequency domain.\n\n3. **Evolution in Frequency Domain**: In the Fourier domain, the PDE simplifies significantly. The Fourier transform of the PDE gives us:\n   \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}(k,t)}{\\partial t} = -ck\\hat{u}(k,t) \\]\n   This is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time that can be solved easily.\n\n4. **Solution in Frequency Domain**: Solving the ODE, we get:\n   \\[ \\hat{u}(k,t) = \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-ckt} \\]\n   Where \\( \\hat{u}(k,0) \\) is the Fourier transform of the initial condition \\( u(x,0) \\).\n\n5. **Inverse Fourier Transform**: To find \\( u(x,t) \\) at any time \\( t \\), we take the inverse Fourier transform:\n   \\[ u(x,t) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}[\\hat{u}(k,t)] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{u}(k,t) e^{ikx} dk \\]\n   Substituting \\( \\hat{u}(k,t) \\):\n   \\[ u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-ckt} e^{ikx} dk \\]\n\n6. **Comparison with Direct Evolution**: If we had evolved \\( u(x,0) \\) directly under the PDE, the solution would be:\n   \\[ u(x,t) = u(x - ct, 0) \\]\n   This is a simple shift in the spatial domain.\n\n7. **Verification**: Comparing both approaches, we see that the Fourier transform method gives us:\n   \\[ u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-ckt} e^{ikx} dk \\]\n   And the direct evolution method gives:\n   \\[ u(x,t) = u(x - ct, 0) \\]\n\n8. **Conclusion**: These two expressions are equivalent. The Fourier transform method effectively captures the same shift in the spatial domain as the direct evolution under the PDE.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
