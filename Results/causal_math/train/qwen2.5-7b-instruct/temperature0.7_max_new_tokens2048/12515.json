    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the original system of equations: \\(Ax = b\\).\n\n2.

Both transformations result in consistent systems because they are obtained by multiplying both sides of the original equation by invertible matrices.\n\n4. For \\(M(Ax) = Mb\\) to be consistent with \\(Ax = b\\), it must be true that \\(M^{-1}Mb = M^{-1}Mx = x\\). This means that the solution \\(x\\) remains unchanged after applying \\(M\\).\n\n5.

The key point here is that multiple matrices \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) can lead to the same consistent solution \\(x\\).

    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Original System**: We start with the system \\(Ax = b\\), where \\(A\\) is an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix, \\(x\\) is an \\(n \\times 1\\) vector of unknowns, and \\(b\\) is an \\(m \\times 1\\) vector.\n\n2. **Transformed Systems**:\n   - The first transformed system is \\(M(Ax) = Mb\\).\n   - The second transformed system is \\(N(Ax) = Nb\\).\n\n3. **Consistency of Solutions**:\n   - For the original system \\(Ax = b\\) to have a solution, there must exist some \\(x\\) such that \\(Ax = b\\).\n   - If \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) are invertible matrices, then multiplying both sides of the equation \\(Ax = b\\) by \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) respectively gives us new systems that also have solutions if the original system has a solution.\n   - However, the solutions to these new systems will be different from the original system because \\(Mx'\\) and \\(Nx''\\) would be solutions to the transformed systems, where \\(x' = M^{-1}x\\) and \\(x'' = N^{-1}x\\).\n\n4. **Deducing Matrices M and N**:\n   - To determine whether we can deduce the specific matrices \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) solely based on the consistency of the solution with \\(Ax = b\\), we need to consider the properties of \\(M\\) and \\(N\\).\n   - Since \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) are invertible, they do not change the fundamental structure of the problem but merely transform it. Therefore, knowing that the transformed systems have consistent solutions does not provide enough information to uniquely identify \\(M\\) and \\(N\\).\n   - There could be many different \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) that satisfy the transformed systems as long as they are invertible and preserve the consistency of the original system.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot deduce the specific matrices \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) used solely based on the consistency of the solution with \\(Ax = b\\).\n\nThus, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Transformation**:\n   - Given \\(Ax = b\\), if we premultiply both sides by an invertible matrix \\(M\\), we get \\(M(Ax) = Mb\\).\n   - Similarly, for another invertible matrix \\(N\\), we have \\(N(Ax) = Nb\\).\n\n2. **Consistency of Solutions**:\n   - The solutions to these transformed systems are consistent with the original system \\(Ax = b\\) only if the transformations preserve the solutions.\n   - This means that any solution \\(x\\) to \\(Ax = b\\) must also be a solution to \\(M(Ax) = Mb\\) and \\(N(Ax) = Nb\\).\n\n3. **Implications for Matrices M and N**:\n   - For \\(M(Ax) = Mb\\) to be consistent with \\(Ax = b\\), \\(M\\) must map the solution space of \\(Ax = b\\) to itself.

This can be rewritten as \\( (MA)x = Mb \\).\n\n3. **Transformation 2**: Similarly, pre-multiplying both sides by matrix \\( N \\) gives us \\( N(Ax) = Nb \\). This can be rewritten as \\( (NA)x = Nb \\).\n\n4. **Consistency with Original System**: For both transformed systems to have consistent solutions with the original system \\( Ax = b \\), the following must hold:\n   - For \\( (MA)x = Mb \\), if \\( x \\) is a solution to \\( Ax = b \\), then \\( x \\) must also satisfy \\( (MA)x = Mb \\).\n   - For \\( (NA)x = Nb \\), if \\( x \\) is a solution to \\( Ax = b \\), then \\( x \\) must also satisfy \\( (NA)x = Nb \\).\n\n5. **Implications**:\n   - Since \\( x \\) is a solution to \\( Ax = b \\), for \\( (MA)x = Mb \\) to be true, \\( MA \\) must be such that it does not alter the solution set of \\( Ax = b \\).

This again implies \\( NA = A \\) or \\( N \\) must be the identity matrix \\( I \\) because \\( N \\) is invertible.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given the constraints that \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are invertible and must preserve the solution set of \\( Ax = b \\), the only possible matrices \\( M \\) and \\( N \\) are the identity matrix \\( I \\).
