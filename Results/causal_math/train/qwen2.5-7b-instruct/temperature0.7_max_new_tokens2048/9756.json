If the original sequence is transformed by \\( f(z) \\), then each element \\( z_n \\) is transformed as \\( f(z_n) = e^{iz_n} \\).\n\n3. **Spectrum Analysis**: The spectrum obtained from the DFT of the transformed sequence will give us information about the frequency components present in the sequence after applying the transformation \\( f(z) \\).\n\n4. **Implications on Transformation**: The function \\( f(z) = e^{iz} \\) is inherently a frequency transformation because it involves an exponential with an imaginary exponent, which is a fundamental operation in Fourier analysis. When you apply this function to each element of the sequence, you are effectively shifting the phase of each frequency component by \\( z_n \\).\n\n5. **Determining Specific Transformations**: To determine if we can identify the specific transformation used (whether it is \\( f(z) \\) or \\( g(z) \\) or both), we need to consider if there are other transformations that would produce the same or similar spectra when applied to the sequence. However, given that \\( f(z) \\) is a well-defined and unique transformation, and without additional information about \\( g(z) \\), it is reasonable to assume that the spectrum obtained from the DFT of the sequence transformed by \\( f(z) \\) uniquely identifies \\( f(z) \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the above reasoning, we can generally determine the specific transformation used, assuming no other transformation \\( g(z) \\) produces the same effect on the DFT spectrum.
