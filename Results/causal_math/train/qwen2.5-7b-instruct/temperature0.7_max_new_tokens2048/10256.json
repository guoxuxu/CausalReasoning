These poles are directly identifiable from the form of the transform.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can uniquely determine the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) from the final transform \\( H(s) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "To determine if we can uniquely determine the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) from the resultant transform after the convolution of \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\), let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Convolution in the Laplace Domain:**\n   The convolution theorem states that the Laplace transform of the convolution of two functions is the product of their Laplace transforms. Therefore, the resultant transform \\( H(s) \\) after the convolution of \\( F(s) \\) and \\( G(s) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = F(s) \\cdot G(s)\n   \\]\n   Substituting the given transforms:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\left( \\frac{1}{s-p} \\right) \\cdot \\left( e^{-qs} \\right) = \\frac{e^{-qs}}{s-p}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Analyze the Resultant Transform:**\n   The form of \\( H(s) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   H(s) = \\frac{e^{-qs}}{s-p}\n   \\]\n   This is a known form of a Laplace transform where the exponential term \\( e^{-qs} \\) indicates a time shift in the inverse transform, and the term \\( \\frac{1}{s-p} \\) represents an exponential function \\( e^{pt} \\).\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform:**\n   The inverse Laplace transform of \\( H(s) \\) is:\n   \\[\n   h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{ \\frac{e^{-qs}}{s-p} \\right\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the time-shifting property of the Laplace transform, we get:\n   \\[\n   h(t) = u(t-q) e^{p(t-q)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( u(t) \\) is the unit step function.\n\n4. **Determine \\( p \\) and \\( q \\):**\n   From the form of \\( h(t) \\):\n   - The time shift \\( q \\) is directly observable as the point at which the function starts.\n   - The parameter \\( p \\) affects the exponential growth/decay rate of the function.\n\n5. **Uniqueness of Determination:**\n   Given the form of \\( H(s) \\), the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) can be uniquely determined from the transform \\( H(s) \\) because:\n   - The exponential term \\( e^{-qs} \\) clearly identifies \\( q \\).\n   - The pole of the rational part \\( \\frac{1}{s-p} \\) clearly identifies \\( p \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the properties of the Laplace transform, we can uniquely determine the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) from the resultant transform \\( H(s) \\).\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
