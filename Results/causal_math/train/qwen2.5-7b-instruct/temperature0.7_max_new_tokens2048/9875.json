This means that after \\(t_1\\), the state \\(x(t)\\) will be influenced not only by \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) but also by \\(C\\) and \\(v\\).\n\n5. **Transformed State z(T)**: The transformed state \\(z(T)\\) is an integral of the kernel \\(K(x(s), s)\\) over the interval from 0 to \\(T\\). Since the state \\(x(t)\\) changes due to the presence of \\(Cv\\) after \\(t_1\\), the integrand \\(K(x(s), s)\\) will also change accordingly.\n\n6. **Dependency Analysis**: For \\(z(T)\\) to depend solely on \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), the state \\(x(t)\\) must remain unaffected by the addition of \\(Cv\\) up to time \\(T\\). However, since \\(Cv\\) starts influencing the system dynamics at \\(t_1\\), the state \\(x(t)\\) will be different from what it would have been without the additional term \\(Cv\\).\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the transformed state \\(z(T)\\) for \\(T > t_1\\) cannot depend solely on the original system parameters \\(A\\) and \\(B\\); it must also account for the influence of \\(C\\) and \\(v\\) after \\(t_1\\).\n\nGiven the above reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
