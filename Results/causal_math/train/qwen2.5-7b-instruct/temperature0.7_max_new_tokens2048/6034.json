    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the given function**: We have \\( z(t) = x(t) + i y(t) \\), where \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) are real-valued functions.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given as \\( \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = Z(s) \\). This means:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} z(t) e^{-st} \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (x(t) + i y(t)) e^{-st} \\, dt\n   \\]\n   This can be separated into real and imaginary parts:\n   \\[\n   Z(s) = X(s) + i Y(s)\n   \\]\n   where \\( X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\} \\) and \\( Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\} \\).\n\n3. **Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions for \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\) are given by:\n   \\[\n   x(0) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} x(t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y(0) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} y(t)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Effect of Doubling Initial Conditions**: If the initial conditions \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) are doubled, then the new functions \\( x'(t) \\) and \\( y'(t) \\) would satisfy:\n   \\[\n   x'(t) = 2x(t) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y'(t) = 2y(t)\n   \\]\n   Consequently, the new function \\( z'(t) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   z'(t) = x'(t) + i y'(t) = 2x(t) + i 2y(t) = 2(x(t) + i y(t)) = 2z(t)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Laplace Transform of Doubled Function**: The Laplace transform of \\( z'(t) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z'(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{2z(t)\\} = 2 \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = 2Z(s)\n   \\]\n\n6. **Given Information**: We know \\( Z(s) \\) at \\( s = a \\). However, we do not have information about the specific form of \\( Z(s) \\) or how it relates to the initial conditions directly.\n\n7. **Inference**: Since doubling the initial conditions results in doubling the entire Laplace transform, knowing \\( Z(s) \\) alone does not provide enough information to determine whether the initial conditions were doubled. The Laplace transform itself does not inherently preserve the information about the initial conditions without additional context.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty whether the initial conditions \\( x(0) \\) and \\( y(0) \\) were doubled.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
