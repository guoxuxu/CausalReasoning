    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understand the given information:**\n   - The differential equation governing the voltage across a capacitor is \\(\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\frac{1}{C}I\\).\n   - A sudden change in current input is described by \\(I(t) = I_0u(t)\\), where \\(u(t)\\) is the Heaviside function.\n   - We need to determine if we can precisely determine the values of \\(R\\) and \\(R'\\) (assuming there might be a typo and it should be \\(R\\) again), as well as the initial condition \\(I_0\\), just by observing the voltage at one time point \\(T\\).\n\n2. **Analyze the differential equation with the given current:**\n   - Substituting \\(I(t) = I_0u(t)\\) into the differential equation, we get:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{RC}V + \\frac{1}{C}I_0u(t)\n     \\]\n   - This is a first-order linear differential equation. The solution for \\(V(t)\\) can be found using standard methods for solving such equations.\n\n3. **Solve the differential equation:**\n   - The general solution to the differential equation is:\n     \\[\n     V(t) = V_{\\text{eq}} + (V(0) - V_{\\text{eq}}) e^{-\\frac{t}{RC}}\n     \\]\n     where \\(V_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{I_0}{R}\\) is the steady-state voltage when \\(t \\to \\infty\\).\n\n4. **Evaluate at time \\(T\\):**\n   - At time \\(T\\), the voltage is:\n     \\[\n     V(T) = \\frac{I_0}{R} + (V(0) - \\frac{I_0}{R}) e^{-\\frac{T}{RC}}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the unknowns:**\n   - From the above equation, we have three unknowns: \\(R\\), \\(V(0)\\), and \\(I_0\\).\n   - Observing the voltage at one time point \\(T\\) gives us only one equation, which is not sufficient to solve for all three unknowns uniquely.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the voltage at one time point, we cannot determine the precise values of \\(R\\), \\(V(0)\\), and \\(I_0\\) because we need more information (at least two time points or additional constraints).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
