If \\( h(x, y) \\) and \\( h(x', y) \\) are different due to the subtle change in \\( x \\), then their Laplace transforms should also generally be different unless the change in \\( x \\) does not significantly alter the behavior of the function in the domain relevant to the Laplace transform.\n\n5. **Assumption of Subtle Change**: A \"subtle change\" implies that while \\( h(x, y) \\) and \\( h(x', y) \\) may be very similar, they are not identical.
