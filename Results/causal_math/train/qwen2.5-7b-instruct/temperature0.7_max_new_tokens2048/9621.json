    "To address this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The differential equation given is:\n   \\[ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} + p\\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0 \\]\n   This is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\n2. **Solution Form**: The general solution to this differential equation can be expressed using the Laplace transform method.

This means we substitute \\( y \\) with \\( y e^{kt} \\) in the differential equation.\n\n4. **Substitution and Simplification**:\n   - Let \\( z = y e^{kt} \\).
