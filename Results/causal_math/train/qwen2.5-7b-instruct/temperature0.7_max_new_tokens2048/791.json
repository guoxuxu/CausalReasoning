Normalization typically involves scaling the function such that the integral (or sum, in discrete cases) of the squared magnitude of the function over all time equals 1.\n   - Mathematically, for a continuous signal \\( s(t) \\), normalization might look like \\( \\hat{s}(t) = \\frac{s(t)}{\\|s\\|_2} \\), where \\( \\|s\\|_2 = \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |s(t)|^2 dt \\right)^{1/2} \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform**:\n   - The Fourier transform of the signal \\( s(t) \\) is given by \\( S(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} s(t) e^{-i2\\pi f t} dt \\).\n   - If the signal \\( s(t) \\) undergoes a phase shift via \\( e^{ix} \\), then the new signal becomes \\( s(t) e^{ix} \\). However, since \\( x \\) is a constant, this phase shift will not affect the frequency domain representation significantly because the Fourier transform is linear and the phase shift can be absorbed into the complex exponential in the Fourier domain.\n\n4. **Effect of Normalization**:\n   - The normalization process scales the signal \\( s(t) \\) by a factor that depends only on the magnitude of \\( s(t) \\). It does not change the underlying shape of the signal but rescales its amplitude.\n   - When normalized, the Fourier transform of the normalized signal \\( \\hat{s}(t) \\) would be \\( \\hat{S}(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{s}(t) e^{-i2\\pi f t} dt \\). Given the normalization, \\( \\hat{S}(f) \\) will still be a scaled version of \\( S(f) \\), but the shape remains the same.\n\n5. **Dependency on Initial Function**:\n   - The Fourier transform \\( S(f) \\) of the original signal \\( s(t) \\) is uniquely determined by \\( s(t) \\) and the properties of the Fourier transform itself.\n   - Even after applying the normalization process, the Fourier transform \\( \\hat{S}(f) \\) retains the dependency on the initial function \\( s(t) \\) because the normalization factor is derived from \\( s(t) \\).\n\nGiven these steps, we conclude that the Fourier transform \\( S(f) \\) at frequency \\( f \\) does indeed depend on the initial function \\( s(t) \\) without consideration of the transformation effect, even after normalization.\n\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}"
