For a closed path integral, the endpoints of the path are the same point, so this doesn't provide additional independent information about the path itself. However, if there was an intervention (like a deformation of the path), this could change the value of the integral.\n\n3. **Intervention**: An intervention might imply a change in the path \\( C \\).
