    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **System Definition**: We have a system defined by \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), which represents a point on the unit circle in the complex plane. This means the function traces out a full circle as \\( t \\) varies from 0 to \\( 2\\pi \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) \\) would give us information about the frequency components present in the function. For \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), the Fourier transform would show a peak at \\( +1 \\) because it is a pure sinusoidal wave with a positive frequency.\n\n3. **Intervention at \\( t = \\pi/2 \\)**: If an intervention occurred at \\( t = \\pi/2 \\), changing the function to \\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\), this would indeed flip the direction of the function. However, flipping the direction of the function does not necessarily mean that the Fourier transform will show a peak at \\( -1 \\). Instead, it would still show a peak at \\( -1 \\) but also a peak at \\( +1 \\) due to the symmetry of the Fourier transform for real functions.\n\n4. **Observation of Fourier Transform**: Given that the Fourier transform at time \\( T > \\pi/2 \\) shows a peak at \\( -1 \\), this could be due to several reasons:\n   - The original function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) alone would show a peak at \\( +1 \\).\n   - An intervention could change the phase or introduce another component, potentially leading to a peak at \\( -1 \\).\n   - The observation might be influenced by noise or other external factors.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: While an intervention at \\( t = \\pi/2 \\) changing the function to \\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\) would theoretically lead to a peak at \\( -1 \\), there is no definitive way to conclude that this was the exact intervention based solely on the Fourier transform showing a peak at \\( -1 \\). Other interventions or factors could also lead to the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"No\"}.",
    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Function**: The initial function is \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\). This represents a point moving counterclockwise around the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\n2. **Fourier Transform Analysis**: The Fourier transform of a signal provides information about the frequency components present in the signal. For the initial function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\), its Fourier transform would show significant energy at the frequency corresponding to \\( 1 \\) (since it's a pure sinusoidal wave with frequency 1).\n\n3. **Intervention and New Function**: If an intervention changes the function to \\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\), this would represent a clockwise movement around the unit circle. The Fourier transform of \\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\) would also show significant energy at the frequency corresponding to \\( -1 \\).\n\n4. **Peak at -1 in Fourier Transform**: The presence of a peak at \\(-1\\) in the Fourier transform suggests that there is significant energy at the frequency \\(-1\\). This could indicate that the function has been modified to move clockwise around the unit circle.\n\n5. **Timing of Intervention**: However, just knowing there is a peak at \\(-1\\) does not definitively tell us when the intervention occurred. The Fourier transform alone cannot pinpoint the exact moment of change; it only tells us that such a change happened.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: While the peak at \\(-1\\) indicates a change to \\( z(t) = e^{-it} \\), it does not provide enough information to conclude that the intervention occurred exactly at \\( t = \\pi/2 \\).
