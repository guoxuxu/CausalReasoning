Let's solve the integral:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{(z-s)t} \\, dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(z-s)t}}{z-s} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n   \\]\n   For the integral to converge, we need \\( \\text{Re}(z-s) < 0 \\). Under this condition:\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\frac{1}{s-z}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Transformation and New Function \\( G(z) \\):**\n   The transformation is given by \\( G(z) = z + w \\). Applying this transformation to \\( F \\):\n   \\[\n   F(G(z)) = F(z + w) = \\frac{1}{s - (z + w)} = \\frac{1}{s - z - w}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Implication of Perturbation:**\n   If we know \\( F(G(z)) \\) and \\( w \\), we can solve for \\( F(z) \\) as follows:\n   \\[\n   F(G(z)) = \\frac{1}{s - z - w}\n   \\]\n   To find \\( F(z) \\), we need to isolate \\( z \\):\n   \\[\n   F(z) = \\frac{1}{s - z}\n   \\]\n   From \\( F(G(z)) \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{s - z - w} = \\frac{1}{s - z'}\n   \\]\n   Where \\( z' = z \\) if no transformation was applied, but here \\( z' = G(z) = z + w \\).\n\n4. **Determine Original \\( z \\):**\n   To uniquely determine \\( z \\) from \\( F(G(z)) \\) and \\( w \\), we need to solve:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{s - (z + w)} = \\frac{1}{s - z}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   s - z - w = s - z\n   \\]\n   Which implies:\n   \\[\n   z = z - w\n   \\]\n   This equation does not provide enough information to uniquely determine \\( z \\) unless \\( w = 0 \\). If \\( w \\neq 0 \\), then \\( z \\) cannot be determined solely from \\( F(G(z)) \\) and \\( w \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
