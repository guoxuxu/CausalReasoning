To reverse this transformation and find the original pattern at \\( t = 0 \\), we would need to know the inverse conformal map \\( w = f^{-1}(\\log(Z)) \\).\n\n4. **Invertibility of Conformal Maps**: Not all conformal maps have an easily invertible form. For example, exponential maps like \\( z = e^{f(w)} \\) might not be straightforward to invert without detailed knowledge of \\( f(w) \\).\n\n5. **Determining Original Pattern Without Knowing the Map**: Given only the new pattern at \\( t = T \\) and no information about the conformal map used, it is generally not possible to uniquely determine the original pattern at \\( t = 0 \\).

    "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Complex Potential**: The complex potential \\( w(z) \\) represents both the velocity potential and the stream function for the fluid flow in the z-plane.

Conformal maps preserve angles locally and are particularly useful in fluid dynamics because they can map one flow pattern to another while preserving certain properties of the flow.\n\n3. **Effect of the Conformal Map**: Applying the conformal map \\( z = e^{f(w)} \\) will transform the original flow described by \\( w(z) \\). The new flow pattern will be represented by a different complex potential \\( w'(z') \\), where \\( z' = e^{f(w)} \\).\n\n4. **Implications on Fluid Flow**: The transformation by a conformal map does not change the nature of the flow (e.g., it remains irrotational if the original flow was), but it changes the geometry and the location of the flow features.
