Therefore, multiplying by \\( t^2 \\) would correspond to differentiating twice in the \\( s \\)-domain.\n\n- **Laplace Transform of \\( h(t) \\)**: The Laplace transform of \\( h(t) \\) is given by:\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{L}(h(t))(s) = \\mathcal{L}(t^2 g(t))(s)\n  \\]\n  Using the property of Laplace transforms, we know that:\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{L}(t^n f(t))(s) = (-1)^n \\frac{d^n}{ds^n} \\mathcal{L}(f(t))(s)\n  \\]\n  Applying this property for \\( n = 2 \\):\n  \\[\n  \\mathcal{L}(t^2 g(t))(s) = -\\frac{d^2}{ds^2} \\mathcal{L}(g(t))(s)\n  \\]\n\n- **Identifying Transformations from \\( F(s) \\)**: Given \\( F(s) \\), which is the Laplace transform of \\( h(t) \\), we have:\n  \\[\n  F(s) = -\\frac{d^2}{ds^2} G(s)\n  \\]\n  where \\( G(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( g(t) \\).\n\n- **Reversing the Transformation**: To find \\( G(s) \\), we need to integrate \\( F(s) \\) twice. This process is theoretically possible but can be complex due to potential boundary conditions and constants of integration.\n\n- **Effect of \\( e^{kt} \\)**: If there were an additional transformation involving \\( e^{kt} \\), it would shift the Laplace transform in the frequency domain. However, since the problem specifies only \\( t^2 \\) and no explicit mention of \\( e^{kt} \\), we focus on the \\( t^2 \\) transformation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the information provided, we can theoretically reverse the \\( t^2 \\) transformation from \\( F(s) \\) to \\( G(s) \\) by integrating \\( F(s) \\) twice. Therefore, we can identify the sequence of transformations applied to \\( g(t) \\) based on \\( F(s) \\).\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
