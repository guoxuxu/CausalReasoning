This changes the system's state immediately at \\( t_1 \\). Let's denote the new state after the intervention by \\( z'(t_1) \\):\n   \\[\n   z'(t_1) = e^{i\\theta t_1}z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Now, the evolution continues from \\( t_1 \\) onward under the influence of \\( k(z) \\). For \\( t > t_1 \\), the state evolves according to:\n   \\[\n   z(t) = e^{i\\theta (t - t_1)}z'(t_1) = e^{i\\theta (t - t_1)}e^{i\\theta t_1}z(t_1) = e^{i\\theta (t - t_1) + i\\theta t_1}z(t_1) = e^{i\\theta t}z(t_1)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final State at Time \\( T \\)**: To find the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) for \\( T > t_1 \\):\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i\\theta (T - t_1)}z(t_1)\n   \\]\n   Since \\( z(t_1) = e^{i\\omega t_1}z(t_1) \\), we substitute:\n   \\[\n   z(T) = e^{i\\theta (T - t_1)}e^{i\\omega t_1}z(t_1) = e^{i(\\theta (T - t_1) + \\omega t_1)}z(t_1)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Dependence on Initial Conditions and Constants**:\n   - The endpoint \\( z(T) \\) depends on the initial conditions \\( z(t_1) \\).\n   - It also depends on the constants \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the endpoint \\( z(T) \\) does depend on both \\( \\omega \\) and \\( \\theta \\), which are the constants of the transformations applied.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```json\n{\"answer\": \"No\"}\n```"
