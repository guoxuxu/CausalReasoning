Since the Laplace transform and its inverse are well-defined mathematical operations, provided \\( Z(s) \\) is the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\), we can recover \\( z(t) \\) exactly.\n\nGiven these steps, we can conclude that we can indeed precisely recover the time-domain function \\( z(t) \\) from its Laplace transform \\( Z(s) \\) without additional information or constraints, as long as the necessary conditions for the existence of the Laplace transform are met.\n\nOutput:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```",
    "Let's reason through this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a time-domain function \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\).\n   - We apply the Laplace transform \\( L \\) to \\( z(t) \\).\n   - The Laplace transform is given by \\( L[z(t)] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}z(t) dt \\).\n\n2. **Applying the Laplace Transform:**\n   - Substitute \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) into the Laplace transform formula:\n     \\[\n     L[z(t)] = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st}e^{it} dt = \\int_0^\\infty e^{(i-s)t} dt\n     \\]\n   - This integral converges for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\) (since \\( i-s \\) has a negative real part for \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\)).\n\n3. **Evaluating the Integral:**\n   - The integral can be evaluated as:\n     \\[\n     \\int_0^\\infty e^{(i-s)t} dt = \\left[ \\frac{e^{(i-s)t}}{i-s} \\right]_0^\\infty\n     \\]\n   - For \\( \\text{Re}(s) > 1 \\), \\( e^{(i-s)t} \\to 0 \\) as \\( t \\to \\infty \\). Thus, the value of the integral is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{s-i}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Inversion of the Laplace Transform:**\n   - To recover \\( z(t) \\) from its Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}[z(t)] \\), we would need to use the inverse Laplace transform.\n   - However, the inverse Laplace transform is not unique without additional information. Different functions can have the same Laplace transform if they differ in their behavior at infinity or have different regions of convergence.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given only the Laplace transform \\( \\frac{1}{s-i} \\), we cannot uniquely determine \\( z(t) = e^{it} \\) without additional information such as the region of convergence or other constraints on \\( z(t) \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"No\"}\n```"
