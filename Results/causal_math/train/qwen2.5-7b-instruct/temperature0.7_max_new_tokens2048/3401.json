Applying the Fourier transform to this initial condition gives us \\(\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k)\\).\n\n2. **Partial Differential Equation (PDE)**: The given PDE is \\(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\), which is a linear diffusion (heat) equation.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform Property**: The Fourier transform has a property that it converts differentiation in the spatial domain into multiplication in the frequency domain. Specifically, for the given PDE, the Fourier transform of both sides yields:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -D k^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   This is because \\(\\mathcal{F}[\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}] = (-ik)^2 \\hat{u} = -k^2 \\hat{u}\\).\n\n4. **Solving the Transformed PDE**: The above equation is a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) in time. Solving it with the initial condition \\(\\hat{u}(k, 0) = \\mathcal{F}[u(x, 0)](k)\\) gives:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-D k^2 t}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Evolution to Time T**: At \\(t = T\\), the solution becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k, T) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-D k^2 T}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Direct Fourier Transform at Time T**: If we were to directly compute the Fourier transform of \\(u(x, T)\\), we would get:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[u(x, T)](k)\n   \\]\n\n7. **Equivalence Check**: To check if \\(\\hat{u}(k, T)\\) is equivalent to \\(\\mathcal{F}[u(x, T)](k)\\), we need to compare the two expressions. From the PDE solution, we know:\n   \\[\n   u(x, T) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{ikx - D k^2 T} dk\n   \\]\n   Taking the Fourier transform of \\(u(x, T)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{F}[u(x, T)](k) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-D k^2 T}\n   \\]\n\nGiven the above steps, we can see that \\(\\hat{u}(k, T)\\) and \\(\\mathcal{F}[u(x, T)](k)\\) are indeed equivalent.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
    "To address the question, let's break down the steps involved in the transformation and evolution of the function \\( u(x, t) \\):\n\n1. **Initial Condition**: We start with the initial condition \\( u(x, 0) \\).\n\n2. **Fourier Transform at Initial Time**: The Fourier transform of \\( u(x, 0) \\) gives us \\( \\hat{u}(k, 0) \\). This represents the spatial frequency content of the initial condition.\n\n3. **Partial Differential Equation (PDE)**: The given PDE is the diffusion equation \\( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} \\). This equation describes how the function \\( u(x, t) \\) evolves over time due to diffusion.\n\n4. **Fourier Transform and PDE**: The key property here is that the Fourier transform converts the PDE into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the frequency domain. Specifically, if we apply the Fourier transform to both sides of the PDE, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -D k^2 \\hat{u}\n   \\]\n   where \\( k \\) is the frequency variable.\n\n5. **Solving the ODE**: The above ODE is a simple linear first-order ODE in \\( t \\). The solution to this ODE, given the initial condition \\( \\hat{u}(k, 0) \\), is:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k, t) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-D k^2 t}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Evolution of \\( \\hat{u}(k, t) \\)**: At time \\( t = T \\), the Fourier transform of \\( u(x, T) \\) would be:\n   \\[\n   \\hat{u}(k, T) = \\hat{u}(k, 0) e^{-D k^2 T}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Direct Computation of Fourier Transform at t = T**: If we were to compute the Fourier transform of \\( u(x, T) \\) directly, it would yield the same result as the above expression because the diffusion equation has been solved in the Fourier domain.\n\nTherefore, the transformed function at time \\( t = T \\), obtained by evolving the Fourier transform of the initial condition, is indeed equivalent to the Fourier transform of the function at time \\( t = T \\).\n\nOutput: {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
