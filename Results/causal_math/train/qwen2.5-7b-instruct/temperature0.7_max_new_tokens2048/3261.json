This means that while the form of the solution remains consistent with the original differential equation, it is expressed in terms of the inverse Laplace transform of a transformed function.\n\nGiven that the Laplace transform and its inverse are linear operations and the differential equation is solved using these transformations, the resulting function \\(z(t)\\) after inverting the Laplace transform will still satisfy the original differential equation \\(\\frac{dz}{dt} = Pz(t) + Q\\) with the initial condition \\(z(0) = z_0\\). Therefore, the function \\(z(t)\\) for \\(t = T\\) remains unchanged from its original form.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}"
