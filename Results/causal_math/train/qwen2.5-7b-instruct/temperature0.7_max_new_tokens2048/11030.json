    "Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) represents a complex exponential function with angular frequency \\( \\omega \\). In the complex plane, this function traces out a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin.\n\n2. **Laplace Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**: The Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{z(t)\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}\\}\n   \\]\n   Using the definition of the Laplace transform:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{i\\omega t} e^{-st} dt\n   \\]\n   Combining the exponentials:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-i\\omega)t} dt\n   \\]\n   Evaluating the integral (assuming \\( s > \\text{Re}(i\\omega) \\)):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}\\{e^{i\\omega t}\\} = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Inverse Laplace Transform**: If we know the Laplace transform \\( \\mathcal{L}[z(t)] \\) at time \\( T \\), we can write:\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}[z(t)] = \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\n   \\]\n   To find \\( \\omega \\), we need to take the inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\):\n   \\[\n   \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{s - i\\omega}\\right\\} = e^{i\\omega t}\n   \\]\n   This confirms that the inverse Laplace transform of \\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\) is indeed \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\n4. **Causal Inference**: The key point here is whether the original form of \\( z(t) \\) can be uniquely determined from its Laplace transform without additional information. Since the Laplace transform \\( \\frac{1}{s - i\\omega} \\) is unique for a given \\( \\omega \\), if we know the Laplace transform at any point in time, we can determine \\( \\omega \\) by taking the inverse Laplace transform.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the Laplace transform of \\( z(t) \\) at time \\( T \\), we can determine the original frequency \\( \\omega \\) because the Laplace transform uniquely maps back to the original function \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}\n```"
