    "Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Given Function**: The function \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a complex exponential function where \\( i \\) is the imaginary unit, \\( \\omega \\) is the angular frequency, and \\( t \\) is time.\n\n2. **Fourier Transformation**: The Fourier transform \\( F(z(t)) = Z(\\omega) \\) converts the time-domain function \\( z(t) \\) into a frequency-domain representation \\( Z(\\omega) \\).\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**: For \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), the Fourier transform can be derived as follows:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\) (where \\( \\omega_0 \\) is a specific frequency) is \\( \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\), where \\( \\delta \\) is the Dirac delta function.\n   - Therefore, for \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\), the Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) is \\( 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega) \\).\n\n4. **Evaluating at \\( t = 0 \\)**: When evaluating \\( z(t) \\) at \\( t = 0 \\), we get \\( z(0) = e^{i\\omega \\cdot 0} = e^0 = 1 \\). This means at \\( t = 0 \\), the function \\( z(t) \\) is a constant value of 1.\n\n5. **Implication on Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) reflects the distribution of frequencies present in the original function \\( z(t) \\). Since \\( z(t) = e^{i\\omega t} \\) is a pure sinusoidal wave with frequency \\( \\omega \\), its Fourier transform is a single impulse (Dirac delta function) at \\( \\omega \\).\n\n6. **Examination at Frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\)**: If we examine \\( Z(\\omega) \\) at some frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\), it will be non-zero only if \\( \\omega_0 = \\omega \\). Otherwise, it will be zero due to the properties of the Dirac delta function.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The value of \\( Z(\\omega_0) \\) will indeed reflect solely the properties of \\( z(t) \\) at that frequency \\( \\omega_0 \\) without other influences because the Fourier transform of a single-frequency sinusoid is a Dirac delta function at that frequency.\n\nTherefore, the answer is {\"answer\":\"Yes\"}.",

For a complex exponential \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\), the Fourier transform is particularly straightforward.\n\n3. **Fourier Transform of \\( z(t) \\)**:\n   - The Fourier transform of \\( e^{i\\omega t} \\) is known to be a Dirac delta function: \\( Z(\\omega) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) \\).\n   - This means that the Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) has all its energy concentrated at the frequency \\(\\omega_0\\).\n\n4. **Evaluating \\( Z(\\omega) \\) at a Specific Frequency**:\n   - When we evaluate \\( Z(\\omega) \\) at a specific frequency \\(\\omega_0\\), we get \\( Z(\\omega_0) = 2\\pi \\).\n   - This result reflects only the properties of \\( z(t) \\) at that exact frequency \\(\\omega_0\\) because the Dirac delta function indicates that there is no influence from any other frequencies.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the Fourier transform \\( Z(\\omega) \\) of \\( z(t) \\) is a Dirac delta function centered at \\(\\omega_0\\), evaluating \\( Z(\\omega) \\) at \\(\\omega_0\\) indeed reflects solely the properties of \\( z(t) \\) at that frequency without any influence from other frequencies.\n\n{\"answer\":\"Yes\"}",
